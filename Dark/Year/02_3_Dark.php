    <p>Saddened by the loss of potential for his skeleton zoo, Rasputin sulks for all of two seconds before turning to something else.  If he can’t have a zoo then fuck it, the skeletons can’t have a warren!  He goes around to the sappers in the Rough Claws and discusses where would be the best areas to...weaken stone structures enough to collapse the whole damn thing.  They are curious about his sudden change of mind but this is obviously not the first time that he has done a sharp mental U-turn so they go with it.  Shutting down the whole warren sounds much better to them personally as opposed to having a random zoo of echo’s trapped in old bones.  Shyrendora and Greg are just glad that they don’t have to try and talk him into the idea.  Talking to him about waiting on the zoo had been exhausting enough for two years worth of conversations.</p>

    <p>Well then...mid crisis is for sure the absolute best time to choose to see what another group is up to!  Nothing malicious and hey, if they notice the really eager young dark elf floating around then perhaps they can pass along a message of “Oh no I’m just chilling, btw if we don’t show up to the year thing it’s cause the clacking of skeletons finally did us in.”  Trischal is in no good headspace for this, so Greg ends up being the one who picks the most obnoxiously perky and extroverted kiddo from the ranks.  Amenidal is more than happy to jump at the work, though a bit put off that he isn’t going to be helping with the clickity-clacks.  Once he is told that he is going to see the winged-elves however, he gets slightly more enthusiastic.</p>

    <p>While Trischal is more focused on trying to get everyone organized to fight, Shyrendora does commend the rangers on their good work of opening up a way to the crystal cavern.  There is a small hope there that she can send some of the civilians off that way, so that they will avoid much of the main fighting.  She remarks that this whole event will probably be one of their first new stories to be put upon the cave walls.  Meanwhile, Trischal is gearing people up for more face-to-face confrontations than they are used to.  It reminds her too much of a war barely passed, but despite the shaking in her hands she knows that they have faced worse than this and come out of it.  She will keep her people safe and bring the missing teams home, spirits be damned!  Shyrendora trusted this to her and she was going to make sure they made it through this.  Fuzzy is just as eager, bouncing around and growling.  It’s kinda cute...until one remembers when the bigger badgers did that.</p>

    <p>Well, we have this beebee ritual...and are in the middle of possibly getting punched by skeletons...lets try it!  Greg still thinks that throwing acid on the marks would work just as well but good lord all the mystic-woo people are clamoring to see how the ritual would remove the marks.  He keeps up with them even when they discuss possibly researching how to improve the ritual to include undead at a later date.  He’s amused by the unimpressed looking cleric in the very back of the group who he knows will help out anyway.  After a while longer he waves them off to do whatever the hell they want to do while skeletons are knocking on their proverbial door.</p>

    <p>I am rolling your <b>Economic</b> and <b>Military</b> results into one block, as they are part of the same operation.</p>
    <p>The battle of the doomed warren - or the final battle of the skeleton war as your people are calling it - is a grueling and violent campaign. It begins as Trischal leads a force of volunteers directly into the teeth of the storm. The history of the dark elves does not contain many heroic charges, but today one is made. Trischal and the Sapper veterans hit the skeletons with everything they’ve got, including the new entrenching tools they have designed specifically with tunnel fighting in mind. They throw themselves into the waves of snapping bones with the singular desire of pushing them back, away from Hilt’Inn.</p>
    <p>In this, they are successful. Very successful. The majority of the remaining skeletons descend on Trischal’s group, shoving their way through tunnels like ands to get to them. Trischal’s leadership carries them through, however, and they push the skeletons back to the mouth of the warren.</p>
    <p>This is where the second phase begins. While the veterans hold the line at the mouth of the warrens, scouts and engineers quietly exit the back of the formation and take to the flanks. They rush into the side tunnels, desperate to complete the work they started on months ago.</p>
    <p>Much of the preliminary work done to collapse the outskirts of the warren can be applied to the warren itself. The engineers push deeper into the tunnels, above the warren itself, to try to collapse it. The operation takes days, and skeletons find them as well. This time, they’re prepared. They fight to defend themselves, and just when things seem toughest relief arrives.</p>
    <p>Dozens of teams of ragged survivors join them. Engineering teams have held out for literally months in the tunnels, surviving on what they could find and hiding from the skeletons. Though most of them are near starvation, they throw in with their friend to complete the job they set out to do so long ago.</p>
    <p>It takes days. Trischal, exhausted from the countless hours of holding back the bony horde, first hears a rumble then a roar. A rush of air and gravel rockets down the tunnel in front of her. Seconds later, she sees the tunnels leading to the warren collapse and cave in, taking dozens of skeletons down in the process.</p>
    <p>A ragged cheer erupts from the exhausted Sappers and they throw themselves at the remaining skeletons…</p>
