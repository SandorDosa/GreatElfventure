    <p><b>Economic:</b> The coming new year brings mixed conversation about where to place resources.  Building in the caverns is very important to creating a true settled home for the people, however there is a discussion about waiting for more research to happen so that things go as smoothly as possible.  This would mean putting resources back into the land around the Hilt’Inn - fixing up the outlying huts and maybe attempting to figure out what to grow out there as a food source for the visitors that may not...live on a diet of small animals, large bugs, and mushrooms.  Eventually, they come to the agreement to start the cavern settlement first because echos be damned they really want to get back into a habitat they are familiar with.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> *<i>sing song voice</i>*  Cloak and dagger!  In all seriousness, getting a routine in place is not a bad idea and is actually giving the scouts a rotating schedule, which is helping with a returning sense of normalcy.  With Shyrendora and Amenidal’s return, news of The Tourist is spread far and wide.  Shyrendora informs everyone that if she is discovered to not engage in a hostile way, just come find her.  Everyone also learns that Amenidal told people to come visit...though he was rather vague about where the visitors should come to.  Keeping an eye out does not seem like a terrible thing.</p>

    <p><b>Military: </b>Big projects are going to be cropping up and the researchers said that building in the caverns would be interestingly tricky with all the sharp crystal formations.  So the sappers once again make an attempt to recruit more into their ranks.</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> Gunnaaa do more research on best ways to work with the crystal formations.  Trying to see if it will be best to break some down, build structures around them, or if a bit of both would probably be the best way to work with everything.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Misc:</b> Location, location, location. Apparently, the Hilt’Inn is in quite an advantageous position. It is the easiest settlement in the elven plains for travelers heading eastwards to reach, with the large caldera being an easy landmark to find. This means that huge groups of immigrant elves heading away from human lands have begun to find their way to the Hilt’Inn, including dark elves!</p>
    <p>There will be pros and potential cons to this listed below, but for now thanks to incoming immigrants you may now use the settlement rules to expand and found new settlements per the rules.</p>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Congratulations! A new settlement has been founded in the Crystal Caverns! And boy has it been founded!</p>

        <li><b>Territory Aspects:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Crystal Mines:</i> Your elves have converted some of the deeper and more treacherous parts of the caverns into a mine. It has crystals of a stunningly wide variety, including (but not limited to) quartz, obsidian, and voidglass.</li>
                <li><i>Beautiful Caves:</i> The large crystal-lined caverns in this area are stunningly beautiful</li>
                <li><i>Geothermal Heat:</i> Like most of the Caldera, this area is kept warm year round by geothermal heat</li>

        <li><b>Garrison:</b> One slot empty </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>You will be able to increase the size of this settlement on Turn 1, year 3.</b></p>
    <p>You will note the “Crystal Mines” Aspect. Apparently the dark elves you sent were extremely enthusiastic about the prospect of living in a cave lined with massive and breathtakingly beautiful crystals. They have not only set up a permanent home there, they have also taken it upon themselves to begin experimenting with ways to harvest the crystals themselves.</p>
    <p>Indeed, the engineers have done so well at setting up methods for gathering and crafting the crystals, <b>all further infrastructure checks made to take advantage of the  crystals in this cavern will have the difficulty reduced by one.</b></p>
    <p>Dang, guys.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> With the massive influx of new faces, and with the hotel getting off the ground, your spyhunters have their hands full. This is their first real “stress test” of being able to safely screen visitors for threats, and they are extremely enthusiastic about it.</p>
    <p>It comes in handy. Late in the season, a group of about five elves checks into the Hilt’Inn. Your spyhunters immediately flag them as suspicious, mostly because they appear extremely organized and suspicious. That, and no one’s seen any big groups of default elves lately.</p>
    <p>It turns out to be a good hunch. Late at night, one of your spyhunters tailing them caught them red handed trying to pick the lock to Trischal’s office. Might not have worked considering dark elves are nocturnal, but regardless a knife fight broke out in the hallways. </p>
    <p>Your guards and spyhunters were able to hold their own, but these unknown elves were skilled fighters. They communicated with loud whistles and by imitating the barking, yipping calls of coyotes. The group was able to coordinate and rush the guards trying to pen them in. They escaped, and were apparently picked up by riders on extremely fast horses once they escaped.</p>
    <p>While you weren’t able to catch them, your spyhunters can prove that they were unable to access any protected information. Perhaps better, they were able to prevent any fatalities and keep the threat away from guests.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> Those volunteers are finally able to get through the training process! Now that the Veteran Sappers have fully recovered, they are able to train up some new recruits.</p>
    <p>You are now in possession of a unit of standard sappers. Unlike your veterans, this group is level 3. Feel free to come up with stats on this unit as you wish.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Your engineering research teams come up with several ingenious plans for creating a mine in the crystal caves, only to find out that the cavern settlement elves have already done all of that and started mining the crystals anyway. They are somewhat miffed by this fact.</p>
    <p>Still, a few of the methods researched are things the cavern settlement hasn’t tried yet, giving you a boost die on your next attempt to utilize the crystals.</p>
    <h3 id="jump3">Roleplay Event 2.1.3: <a href="../Bonus/3_Visiting Aftermath.php">Visiting Aftermath</a></h3>
    <h3><b>Minor Event:</b> Location, Location, Location</h3>
    <p><b>Duration: 3 turns</b></p>
    <p>As it turns out, as Lock is slowly enforcing peace in his growing kingdom he is encountering more and more pockets of elven holdouts. Those elves who belong to groups that have migrated to the plains are slowly being given supplies and told to cross the badlands to join their kin.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, this is great for the Hilt’Inn. It’s by far the easiest settlement to reach crossing the Badlands, the caldera is easily visible and you just gotta aim for the south side of it. Most groups end up crossing through your territory on their way to their future homes, and they are almost universally quite happy to take a break, rent a room, and get a bath. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, there are many of them who simply do not have the coin to actually rent a room. The dark elves aren’t heartless, so volunteers have been setting up a refugee camp on the shores of Crater Lake where those who are too destitute to afford a room can get some rest before pressing on to their future home.</p>
    <p>It’s working, but the strain on resources this improvised refugee camp is causing is becoming an issue. For the moment, the extra profits from the boom in business is covering the margins but that may not be the case forever.</p>
    <p>You are <b>not</b> yet taking stress damage, but unless the dark elves find some way to deal with the refugees without a huge drain on resources, they will start taking economic stress next year.</p>
