    <p><b>Economic:</b> While the researchers are working out what to do with the food ideas they have, we’re going to try and build up the little camp area to something that will house these refugees a little more comfortably.  Probably repurpose a few of the unused smaller buildings from the actual town for supplies.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Well then that was exciting.  Upon finding out that Fuzzy had in fact been in Trischal’s office the whole time, everyone agrees that what happened was the best outcome possible.  Going forward, it’s probably a good idea to have descriptions of elves like that on a rather permanente watch list.  Based on what Shyrendora knows from her brief conversation with Dust at the potluck, others might be having similar issues.  She intends to send some messages to the dreamdust elves to see if Dust has any more information that he can lend on these new elves.  For now however, they are going to try and keep up their routine that they are getting into.  If it continues to do well enough, there are talks of making a unit/division of spyhunters for the Hilt’Inn specifically.</p>

    <p><b>Military: </b>Scouting further into caverns so we know what else is around us aside from the Hilt’Inn and the collapsed warren.  We know that there is much more going into the caldera, but we want to be cautious of potential straggler skeletons as well as any more excessive amount of traps.  (Cautious = maybe 2 squares connected to the caverns)  If this goes decently, Trischal has agreed that a small group could possibly go visit the winged-elves later on to see what those caves they have are all about, plus give some pointers on stone work if they still need it.</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> Based on what we witnessed with the blade elves and their food problems, we’re going to try and research what we could put out at the camp as a potential small farm for the refugees.  Something easy enough for them to take care of with a little guidance or gather food for themselves before they move onwards kind of thing.  In theory they want to make something that can work for the current situation, but also something that could be utilized in the future when the refugee influx has calmed down.  (It’s probably potatoes but we’ll see what fate gives us)</p>

    <p><b>Economic:</b> Building up the area that the refugees have started to congregate in turns out to be an excellent idea. Once your engineers get out there and actually look the place over, it’s completely unsafe and unsanitary. It’s little more than the guts of old wagons and blankets covering cleared dirt areas, with no sanitation or clean water. Completely unacceptable for greeting the most desperate of your allies as they enter your new land.</p>
    <p>Your engineers tear down the shantytown and build the area into real, actual temporary housing with sanitation, bathing, common meal areas, clean water, and warm safe places to sleep as well as security and medical assistance. It’s not the Hilt’Inn, but it’s safe.</p>
    <p>Also importantly, it’s a relatively attractive, well made set of buildings. The shantytown was kinda hurting guest experiences.</p>
    <p>The Hilt’Inn has the temporary aspect Refugee Center. The dilemma is not resolved, but this is a big step in the right direction. Feeding them is still putting a heavy strain on your resources and you still need a system for getting them where they need to go, but their basic dignity is now being respected and you are providing desperately needed relief to those most harmed by the exodus. You did good.</p>
    <p>Goodwill, however, is not without cost. The dark elves dug deep into their building resources to complete this project. Any Infrastructure checks next turn will take a <b>setback die</b> due to low supplies.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Shyrendora has a gut feeling. An instinct. She only has a few scattered pieces of information, but something about it that she can’t put her finger on is pointing her in a direction. If the last few decades have taught her anything, it's that instinct is a gift best heeded.</p>
    <p>She is convinced that someone is following the Tourist. Knowing that she just rolled through and wasn’t a threat, she has a hunch that whoever it is that might be following her might just roll through looking for her.</p>
    <p>She tells her most trusted spyhunters this, and asks them to keep an eye out for individuals that might be hunting their previous guest. Shyrendora decides to take a few shifts herself, and puts some of her own personal time into checking for spies. If someone is clever enough to elude someone as intense as Katya, they will probably be hard to catch.</p>
    <p>It is during one of her turns spyhunting that her keen dark elf ears overhear something. Voices, from one of the back store rooms. They don’t sound pleasant. Shyrendora drapes herself in invisibility and investigates. She follows the voices to an old wine storage room in the basement with the door closed. Carefully, she listens.</p>
    <p>“Once again. Where is the Heir?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora’s eyes go wide. The first voice is elven, imperious and self assured. She doesn’t recognize it. The second elf she recognizes. It’s the young spyhunter who first spotted Katya. Shyrendora carefully opens the door just enough for her thin frame to slip through.</p>
    <p>The spyhunter is tied to a chair. His eyes are glazed over and unfocused. A tall, straight-backed fire elf stands in front of him. The fire elf is dressed in white robes and has burnt red skin with bright yellow eyes, which are currently fixed on the spyhunter. An arcane pattern whirls on his hand, apparently having charmed the young elf.</p>
    <p>“You know what I am talking about. She would appear to be a blade elf with long white hair, black clothes, and a silver sword. You would not miss her. You are evading my questions. Have you seen the Heir? Has she been here?”</p>
    <p>“I… should not answer that question.” The spyhunter grimaces, trying to resist the magic.</p>
    <p>“Then I shall be more persuasive…”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora has seen enough. She draws a dagger and takes a step towards the fire elf.</p>
    <p>The fire elf snaps his head back around. His eyes are wide and looking in her direction, though not directly at her. His nose is wrinkled back, as if he smelled something. Shyrendora freezes.</p>
    <p>“Typical,” The fire elf grumbles.</p>
    <p>Acting on instinct, Shyrendora lunges towards him. He pulls something out from under his robes and throws it in her general direction. Without thinking, Shyrendora jukes out of the way. Something hot and foul smelling explodes where she was just standing. </p>
    <p>The fire elf makes a dash for the door, rushing straight past Shyrendora. She slashes reflexively with her dagger. She feels it scrape chain, then bite flesh. Oddly, she sees the robes shimmer as her blade passes through them. She twists the dagger and pulls, causing a gush of blood to hit the floor.</p>
    <p>As the invisibility flows off of her, the fire elf howls in surprise and staggers back. He clutches his wound and dashes away from her, still moving quickly. He meets her eyes briefly, then his hand flashes from under his robes. Shyrendora jerks away, but the attack was not at her. The fire elf makes a mocking two finger salute and bolts for the door.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora glances back as she hears a thud. The spyhunter has fallen to the ground. There is a dart in his arm. His eyes are rolling back in his head and he is foaming out the sides of his mouth. The fire elf is already running through the door frame. Shyrendora makes a decision.</p>
    <p>She carefully pulls the dart out of the young elf’s arm. A black ooze drips from the tip of it. She clamps her fingers on the spyhunter’s arm, wraps it tightly with a cloth wrap she pulls off of her clothing. She tries to keep the poison from spreading.</p>
    <p>“Guards!” She screams, “Spy! Scramble to exits! Medic here!”</p>
    <p>She knows it’s too late to catch the spy. She made her call.</p>
    <p>Thanks to her swift decision, the spyhunter recovers. The fire elf is not caught. Piecing together what happened, the spyhunter claims this elf spoke to him for a moment in a hallway, then his memory got fuzzy. By bringing together your other spyhunters, two more have gaps in their memory. Those two were new recruits, however, and knew little about the actual sensitive information the dark elves have. Thankfully, only this spyhunter knew that the Tourist was actually here and he appears to have not given up this information.</p>
    <p>The fire elf had come in a group of refugees and checked into the hotel under the name Marcus Boldleaf, almost certainly fake. The item thrown was a peculiar burning tanglefoot bag. Your alchemists are still trying to figure out the poison.</p>
    <p>It was a close one, and only Shyrendora’s instinct managed to protect the secrets of the  dark elves. As to what you do with the information you have, well, that is up to you.</p>

    <p><i>Aftermath:</i> During the investigation, Amenidal decides that he can use Blood Biography to learn information about the spy. His first attempt at casting fails as he runs into a magic ward used to protect information about the spy.</p>
    <p>Undaunted, Amenidal cleverly spots a weakness in the arcane defenses. He flips through his books and determines a way to take advantage of it. Pooling his reservoir of arcane energy, Amenidal finds the flaw in the ward and exploits it. By pouring all his energy into that crack, his spell gets through and delivers the following information:</p>
    <p><i>Who are you?</i><br/>I am Titus Skoda</p>
    <p><i>What are you?</i><br/>I am a male wolf elf spy</p>
    <p><i>How was your blood spilled?</i><br/>I was stabbed by Shyrendora, leader of the dark elves</p>
    <p><i>When was your blood spilled?</i></br>Approximately two hours ago</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> The first few days of cautious tunnel travel open up to smooth sailing. It appears that the further you get from the warren, the fewer and fewer traps there are. Once they are past the first square north of Nadezhda, they don’t encounter any. In fact, they believe they are the first to explore this part of the cave system. There are still skeletons of course, but they are only encountered in very small groups. Nothing a few clever elves with bonepickers can’t easily handle.</p>
    <p>With the assigned territories completed ahead of schedule, the pathfinding team makes the decision to press on, one more territory north. The caves get deeper and narrower, harder to traverse. They still encounter no signs of other habitation, but the caves are getting warmer as they get closer to the center of the caldera. There, in a dark narrow cave, a pathfinder makes a discovery.</p>
    <p>A week later, the pathfinder team returns. Triumphantly and a little smugly, the lead pathfinder tosses something onto Trischal’s desk. It lands with a heavy thud.</p>
    <p>It is a lump of raw silver ore.</p>
    <p>All of these territories have the <i>Deep Caves</i> aspects. The territory exactly 3 squares north of Nadezhda has the <i>Geothermal Heat</i> aspect as well as the absolutely valuable <i>Silver Vein</i> Aspect.</p>
        <p><b>Mental:</b> Setting up a stable food source for a large number of people isn’t going to be easy. Your researchers agree that, refugees or no, this is going to be a major issue that needs to be addressed in the future of the dark elves. Your population is only going to grow, and cave fungus alone won’t work forever. It’s not going to be as easy as just plopping down some potatoes, either. The terrain around the Hilt’Inn is not really suitable for farming, it’s too dry and rocky. They’re going to have to think up another place to build a real farm.</p>
    <p>While they haven’t come up with a solution yet, your researchers are narrowing in on the problem. You will have a <b>boost die</b> if you research it again next turn.</p>
