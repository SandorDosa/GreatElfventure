    <p>Huzzah!  While there is obviously danger a-foot, everyone is mainly grateful to be off the road and into more familiar(ish) territory.  Rasputin has proudly proclaimed the settlement to be named The Hilt’Inn, much to everyone’s bafflement.  They can’t tell if he is making a dagger pun or if he’s just really, really into giving things weird names but they let him do his thing.  He also attempts to talk the other leader’s into letting him use some resources to make a small enclosure for some of the many skeletons.  “Is good idea for tourism!  Skeletons bring many clerics to study.  Can even take bone as souvenir when done!”  They recommend that he just seal off some of the caves that lead to the warren instead and tell him that those...could potentially be the start of his skeleton zoo one day.</p>

    <p>Trischal is an absolute paranoid mess until the Pathfinder’s return, and with their return she becomes a bouncing ball of energy.  She takes all that they found to Shyrendora and tries to map out a future plan.  The lodge is big enough for the moment and the town is nice? but it is not a cave and nor does it offer the supplies that they will require in future endeavors.  She recommends blocking off the kobold warren to the best of their ability until they are at a point where they can more readily deal with such a condensed area of traps and undead.  As it stands, she figures that trying to clear out a path for them to get to the other cave in the northeast will give them more room to maneuver.</p>
    <p><i>Rangers</i> trapping of the <b>Reconnaissance</b> skill to try and clear out a path of least resistance to the cave in the northeast.  Using the old traps against skeletons and then dismantling those traps sounds like a good starting point.  <b>STUNT</b> use of Tunnel Fighting!<br/>

    <p>Okay, so having a guy bleed out through facial orifices is not a great start to trying to figure those arcane runes out, but they are also not great and need to get gone.  Greg thinks that they should just drop acid on all of them since it was deemed that most were not magical and could be safely removed.  Shyrendora, who really doesn’t want to have to fix this place up anymore than they already do, tells him to wait on that and try some non-destructive ways of removing them.  He grumbles but gathers together some of their more spiritually inclined to come up with ideas on how to deal with them in a way that won’t eat through wood or run dangers of burning down buildings.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Things start out well enough. Your pathfinders made an excellent map of the tunnels surrounding the warrens and got a general idea of the layout of the warrens themselves. They also clearly marked most of the traps with paint. Your engineering teams move carefully, guarded by sappers. Some tunnels are prepared for collapse, others are sealed off with stones or concrete. The first few tunnels are sealed well enough, and the engineering teams spread out- there are dozens of tunnels leading into the warrens, and it will take some time to seal them out.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, there is a resounding crash and rumble that echoes throughout the cave system, followed by panicked shouting:</p>
    <p><i>“Breach! Breach! Breach!”</i></p>
    <p>What happened next, you are currently piecing together from exhausted survivors. There was a cave collapse of some kind, perhaps a trap that the pathfinders missed. And entire tunnel system came down, and to the horror of the engineers exposed the center of the warren. Kobold skeletons poured into the tunnel systems, and fell upon your engineers.</p>
    <p>But then, something unexpected happened. The engineers at the center of the breech were the command team, known as Tunnel Rat One. They were led by Volodia Yevgeni, an older elf who had been with you for the entire war. Even though they were not soldiers, they did not flee.</p>
    <p>In fact, Volodia apparently sent out runners passing along a message to the other engineering teams: Hold the tunnels. Don’t let them through. Along with his exact words, “I let monsters take my tunnels once, I am damned well not letting that happen again!”</p>
    <p>The engineers fought back. Even though their positions were overrun by literally hundreds of skeletons, even though they were fighting with hammers, picks, survey tools, or even rocks or their fists. They kept doing their jobs, kept collapsing caves, kept trying to slow the grim tide. The engineers bought precious time for defenses to be prepared in the caves leading directly to Hilt’Inn. The time was desperately needed, as the skeletons followed the ragged survivors as they fled to safety. The skeletons have found Hilt’Inn, The barricades are holding. For now.</p>
    <p>Volodia was last seen ordering junior members of his squad to fall back as his team prepared to collapse a tunnel sealing off the worst of the breach. It is not known what happened to them after that. Tunnel Rat One is unaccounted for, as are over a dozen other engineering teams. Many have likely survived as they had quite a few options for escape, but in the chaos they are still somewhere out on the tunnels. Confirmed casualties are many.</p>
    <p>The havok caused by swarms of skeletons prevented the engineers from properly sealing the entrances to the doomed warren as they wanted to. Skeletons are streaming out of it still, though the engineers did manage to seal enough tunnels to slow their progress.</p>
    <p>Despite all of this, the engineers that made it back are absolutely driven to return to their work. Despite the injuries, despite the deaths, despite the missing, you are damned near having to hold them back from diving back into the tunnels to help their trapped or missing friends.</p>
    <p>Any actions involving the engineering teams next turn will receive a boost die, in addition while the attempt to seal the tunnels failed the heroic efforts of the engineers and Tunnel Rat One have had several effects on the event, see below.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Once again, the insane events mentioned above mean your spyhunters are a little bit distracted. Everyone’s having to pitch in for shifts at the barricades, and this leaves precious few experienced individuals to go off and look for spies.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, your analysts agree any spies would have to be fucking insane to try to sneak into Hilt’Inn right now.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> In an absolutely shocking and unexpected turn of events, something actually goes according to the godsdamned plan for once. The rangers are successful in making the tunnels leading to the crystal caverns safe. The pathfinders had marked the traps well enough, and there were far fewer traps and skeletons in that area than around the warren. Further, the idea of leading skeletons into traps actually works extremely well. Skeletons aren’t exactly bright, and usually just run directly at whatever living creature they see. This makes it exceedingly easy to lure them into traps.</p>
    <p>The rangers are a little bit sad that their successful mission is completely overshadowed by the insanity going on around the warren. Not like, a setback die’s worth of sad. They’re professionals. But still, they worked really hard…</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Congratulations! You have developed the Cleanse ritual!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Risk:</b> Low</li>
        <li><b>Target:</b> One settlement that you control</li>
        <li><b>Difficulty:</b> 1 + any difficulty added by opposed ritual magic or targeted magic aspect.</li>
        <li><b>Effect:</b> This ritual will remove one aspect from a settlement related to dark magic, evil spirits, eldritch horror, or generally anything creepy and disturbing. The difficulty of the ritual is directly related to what you are trying to remove, and this ritual may be inadequate for extremely dangerous dark magic or powerful effects. However, using the ritual poses much less risk than attempting to directly remove dangerous effects.</li>
        <li>Further research can be used to improve this ritual.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The guy who was bleeding from the eyes and ears is feeling much better now, actually. Thanks you for asking! He can’t remember a damned thing about what he read. That’s probably good.</p>
    <h3>Event: Tourism Disaster</h3>
    <p><b>Status: <span style="color:red">Critical</span></b></p>
    <p>The skeletons have found their way to Hilt’Inn, and the tunnels are not sealed. Your soldiers are fending off attacks from skeletons daily, and it’s only a matter of time until a big clump of skeletons rushes the barricade. They aren’t intelligent or planning anything, but they have a base cunning to them that makes them understand to follow if a bunch of other skeletons run towards something. Not to mention you still have dozens of engineers unaccounted for in the tunnels, including Volodia and Tunnel Rat One.</p>
    <p>Speaking of Tunnel Rat One, it’s not all gloom and doom. Tunnel Rat One and the engineers’ heroic - no, <i>legendary</i> - actions have had the following effects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Your people are inspired to action by the tale, and you do not take more morale stress this turn, despite the dire circumstances. Your stress is still not able to heal naturally.</p></li>
        <li><p>Though you suffered many losses, the engineers destroyed quite a few skeletons in the fighting and with tunnel collapses. Any further actions taken to get rid of them will have the difficuly reduced by one.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>So while the situation is grim, the dark elves are prepared for what’s ahead. And as far as what’s ahead… it seems that this problem has escalated past the point where containment is possible. Whatever happens, the dark elves are going to have to handle this directly. Until the doomed warren is somehow brought under control, Hilt’Inn will not be safe.</p>
