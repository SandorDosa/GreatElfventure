    <p>Saddened by the loss of potential for his skeleton zoo, Rasputin sulks for all of two seconds before turning to something else.  If he can’t have a zoo then fuck it, the skeletons can’t have a warren!  He goes around to the sappers in the Rough Claws and discusses where would be the best areas to...weaken stone structures enough to collapse the whole damn thing.  They are curious about his sudden change of mind but this is obviously not the first time that he has done a sharp mental U-turn so they go with it.  Shutting down the whole warren sounds much better to them personally as opposed to having a random zoo of echo’s trapped in old bones.  Shyrendora and Greg are just glad that they don’t have to try and talk him into the idea.  Talking to him about waiting on the zoo had been exhausting enough for two years worth of conversations.</p>

    <p>Well then...mid crisis is for sure the absolute best time to choose to see what another group is up to!  Nothing malicious and hey, if they notice the really eager young dark elf floating around then perhaps they can pass along a message of “Oh no I’m just chilling, btw if we don’t show up to the year thing it’s cause the clacking of skeletons finally did us in.”  Trischal is in no good headspace for this, so Greg ends up being the one who picks the most obnoxiously perky and extroverted kiddo from the ranks.  Amenidal is more than happy to jump at the work, though a bit put off that he isn’t going to be helping with the clickity-clacks.  Once he is told that he is going to see the winged-elves however, he gets slightly more enthusiastic.</p>

    <p>While Trischal is more focused on trying to get everyone organized to fight, Shyrendora does commend the rangers on their good work of opening up a way to the crystal cavern.  There is a small hope there that she can send some of the civilians off that way, so that they will avoid much of the main fighting.  She remarks that this whole event will probably be one of their first new stories to be put upon the cave walls.  Meanwhile, Trischal is gearing people up for more face-to-face confrontations than they are used to.  It reminds her too much of a war barely passed, but despite the shaking in her hands she knows that they have faced worse than this and come out of it.  She will keep her people safe and bring the missing teams home, spirits be damned!  Shyrendora trusted this to her and she was going to make sure they made it through this.  Fuzzy is just as eager, bouncing around and growling.  It’s kinda cute...until one remembers when the bigger badgers did that.</p>

    <p>Well, we have this beebee ritual...and are in the middle of possibly getting punched by skeletons...lets try it!  Greg still thinks that throwing acid on the marks would work just as well but good lord all the mystic-woo people are clamoring to see how the ritual would remove the marks.  He keeps up with them even when they discuss possibly researching how to improve the ritual to include undead at a later date.  He’s amused by the unimpressed looking cleric in the very back of the group who he knows will help out anyway.  After a while longer he waves them off to do whatever the hell they want to do while skeletons are knocking on their proverbial door.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>I am rolling your <b>Economic</b> and <b>Military</b> results into one block, as they are part of the same operation.</p>
    <p>The battle of the doomed warren - or the final battle of the skeleton war as your people are calling it - is a grueling and violent campaign. It begins as Trischal leads a force of volunteers directly into the teeth of the storm. The history of the dark elves does not contain many heroic charges, but today one is made. Trischal and the Sapper veterans hit the skeletons with everything they’ve got, including the new entrenching tools they have designed specifically with tunnel fighting in mind. They throw themselves into the waves of snapping bones with the singular desire of pushing them back, away from Hilt’Inn.</p>
    <p>In this, they are successful. Very successful. The majority of the remaining skeletons descend on Trischal’s group, shoving their way through tunnels like ands to get to them. Trischal’s leadership carries them through, however, and they push the skeletons back to the mouth of the warren.</p>
    <p>This is where the second phase begins. While the veterans hold the line at the mouth of the warrens, scouts and engineers quietly exit the back of the formation and take to the flanks. They rush into the side tunnels, desperate to complete the work they started on months ago.</p>
    <p>Much of the preliminary work done to collapse the outskirts of the warren can be applied to the warren itself. The engineers push deeper into the tunnels, above the warren itself, to try to collapse it. The operation takes days, and skeletons find them as well. This time, they’re prepared. They fight to defend themselves, and just when things seem toughest relief arrives.</p>
    <p>Dozens of teams of ragged survivors join them. Engineering teams have held out for literally months in the tunnels, surviving on what they could find and hiding from the skeletons. Though most of them are near starvation, they throw in with their friend to complete the job they set out to do so long ago.</p>
    <p>It takes days. Trischal, exhausted from the countless hours of holding back the bony horde, first hears a rumble then a roar. A rush of air and gravel rockets down the tunnel in front of her. Seconds later, she sees the tunnels leading to the warren collapse and cave in, taking dozens of skeletons down in the process.</p>
    <p>A ragged cheer erupts from the exhausted Sappers and they throw themselves at the remaining skeletons…</p>
    <h4 id="jump"></h4>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Amenidal returns happily late in the season. <a href="../Bonus/0_A Moody Visitor.php">Apparently he did indeed get “caught”</a> before he made it into Asavardi, but after that all he had to to was ask to get let in…</p>
    <p>Asavardi has the following stats</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Name:</b> Asavardi</li>
        <li><b>Description:</b> A canyon home</li>
        <li><b>Size:</b> Village</li>
        <li><b>Territory Aspects: </b>
        <ul><li><i>Copper Veins:</i> The cliffs that Asavardi are built into are rich in copper.</li>
            <li><i>Riverside:</i> The cliffs that Asavardi are built into run along the Goldfall river.</li></ul></li>
        <li><b>Settlement Aspects:</b>
        <ul><li><i>Cliff Caves:</i> The dwellings in Asavardi are largely built into a shallow cave system along the canyon walls.</li>
            <li><i>Empty Slot</i></li></ul></li>
        <li><b>Garrison:</b> Currently full with the Harriers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Amenidal notes that the winged elves appear to have been trying to make improvements to the stone walls of the canyon, but man, their stonemasonry is awful! Getting better, though…</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Wow, yeah, using the ritual was a really good idea. Even with the added protection of using a magic ritual to remove the runes, the situation nearly gets out of control. Whatever cursed knowledge was contained in those writings, it reacts violently with any attempt to alter them or remove them. Apparently, while the runes themselves weren’t magic whatever topic they were written about was extremely magical.</p>
    <p>Any discussion about trying to learn the information contained within them is silenced when one rune sprays out enough blood to fill a hallway up to knee high when removed. Probably best not to know what that was about.</p>
    <p>Although it takes a bit of scrubbing to get all the blood residue out, the ritual is a success! The Disturbing Danger aspect has been removed from Hilt’Inn, though it doesn’t free up an aspect slot.</p>
    <h3>Event: Tourism Disaster</h3>
    <p><b>Status: <span style="color=green">Resolved</span></b></p>
    <p>The sappers and engineers return. They are bloodied, battered, exhausted, and triumphant. Though some fell in the process of destroying the warren, deaths were far fewer than projected. The Sappers have taken casualties, but they have suffered far worse in the past and they will recover with rest and time.</p>
    <p>The collapsing warren destroyed nearly all of the skeletons. The final push from the Sappers got nearly all of the rest. While some doubtlessly escaped the hunt and it will be years before the caves around the warren are truly safe, Hilt’Inn finally knows peace.</p>
    <p>Sadly, Volodia and Tunnel Rat One did not survive. In the last cleanup sweep, Trischal finds  their remains buried in rubble. They brought one of the largest tunnels down literally on top of themselves, taking out dozens of skeletons and sealing the largest tunnel that lead from the warren to Hilt’Inn. Their actions doubtlessly saved the town. There is talk of building a memorial. They will not be forgotten.</p>
    <p>The news from the rest of the lost engineers is better. The vast majority of them survived. Thankfully, you acted quickly enough and organized a relief operation effectively enough that they were reached before they completely ran out of supplies. Though they’re all taking some vacation time, you have more living heroes than dead.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the engineers - and some of your civilians - report something truly bizarre. Those were not the only skeletons. From skeletal dogs and cats, to skeletal fish in the lakes, skeletal moles, and even tiny helpless skeletal birds and bats, it seems everything in the area was turned into skeletons. While these skeletons are far from an actual threat, the news is somewhat concerning. Whatever made this happen appears to be long gone, but man. That’s creepy.</p>
    <p>Your sappers and engineers are <i>legends</i>. Parents tell their kids bedtime stories about their heroism, and teenagers brag about maybe trying out for the unit someday. Due to their heroism and prestigious status, all further attempts to recruit Sappers specifically will have the <b>difficulty reduced by one.</b></p>
    <p>The Veteran Sappers have the Fatigued and Light Casualties conditions, but so long as they remain in the garrison and rest these will heal at the end of the next turn.</p>
    <p>You solved the event fast enough that you did not take stress this turn, and your stress begins healing next turn.</p>
    <p>Your sappers and engineers have come up with a new weapon! In the chaos surrounding the skeleton war, the light daggers and knives preferred by the dark elves proved ineffective against fleshless bone. Sappers improvised many weapons during the time, but compact collapsible shovels ended up being extremely agile and adaptable weapons in the brutal close quarters fighting. Your Sappers have refined the design into an actual weapon:</p>

    <p>Elven Entrenching Tool - This combination weapon/tool was developed by the dark elves during the brutal tunnel fighting of the skeleton wars. It consists of a collapsible sharpened shovel head on a stout wooden handle, with a sharp pointed spike opposite the shovel head. It is an extremely useful light digging and rockbreaking tool, as well as a surprisingly versatile and effective weapon in the hands of those trained to do so.</p>
    <p>When collapsed, the broad sharpened head of the shovel can be swung like an axe or the blunt face of the shovel can be used as a bludgeon or a shield. In this configuration, it has the Blocking special quality, can be used to deal bludgeoning or slashing damage, and has a x3 crit range.</p>
    <p>When extended, the shovel and pick ends extend from the top of the tool like a pickaxe. The sharpened shovel end can be used to deal slashing damage, and the pick end can be used to deal piercing damage. In this configuration it has a x4 crit range, but does not have the blocking special quality.</p>
    <p>Extending or collapsing the tool is  a swift action. The tool is usually stored collapsed in a sheath. Extending the tool can be done as a free action as part of drawing the weapon if the user has Quick Draw. Changing the user’s grip to adjust the damage type done is an immediate action. The weapon is not a double weapon and any magic enhancements done apply to all uses of the weapon. If a magic property only counts when a weapon has one damage type, it only counts when the entrenching tool is being used to deal that type of damage.</p>
    <p>Despite not having traditional elven weapon proficiency, dark elves treat the elven entrenching tool as a martial weapon.</p>
    <p><b>Further, due to the sheer bravery with which the Dark Elves tackled the wave of bone, they receive a permanent upgrade to one of the following skills:</b> Infrastructure, Conventional Warfare, or Spirituality</p></p>
