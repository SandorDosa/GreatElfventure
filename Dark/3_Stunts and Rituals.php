    <h1>Stunts</h1>
    <h2>Adaptive Engineering</h2>
    <p>Dark elf sappers are extremely adept at finding ingenious solutions to large problems.  If a division with engineers is unoccupied and at full strength in an underground location, you may use the Reconnaissance skill under a trapping of recovery.  This occupies the division for one turn, and they gain the Fatigued condition afterwards.  Can only be used once a year.</p>
    <h2>Tunnel Fighting</h2>
    <p>Dark elves are masters of operations and fighting in close confined quarters.  Any military skills used in squares that contain tunnels, caves, mines, or other underground aspects receive a boost die.</p>
