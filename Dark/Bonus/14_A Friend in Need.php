    <h1>A Friend in Need</h1>
    <p>Kolya has been missing for almost a month.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora has looked for him. The Spyhunters have looked for him. Even with… him being back, even with Amenidal and Trischal gone, they’ve found the time. There hasn’t been any sign of him since. Shyrendora is terrified for him. Even if he’s alive, with everything Bryti has said about the affliction, if he <i>is</i> afflicted, every day makes things worse.</p>
    <p>And now Bryti is coming. With everything else going on, the crazy werewolf is getting thrown in the middle of things. Shyrendora isn’t even completely sure what she intends to do here. Still, even though she knows things could still get worse, the fact that Bryti is going to be here any minute… is comforting.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora needs a friend right now.</p>
    <p>For the moment, she is attempting to occupy herself by staring stonily down at a pile of papers and scrolls while sitting in her old office with one ear constantly turned to the door in anticipation.  The runners knew to either bring her expected guests here or let her know that they had arrived.</p>
    <p>She continues to stare.</p>
    <p>There were requests to see to, complaints to hear out, reports to read, orders to give out.</p>
    <p>“Give over complaints.”</p>
    <p>She doesn’t look up at where Rasputin is hovering near her.  “You can’t even read them, Uncle.”</p>
    <p>He tuts, “No, but can taste them.  Is like fine aged wine.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora puts on her best Greg Face and finally lifts her head to give him a long stare.  </p>
    <p>All she gets in response is a pat on her head while another hand reaches down and somehow grabs the correct selection of papers.  His voice is teasing but gentle, “I said would help, so I am helping.  Let yourself breathe, Little Dora.”</p>
    <p>She pulls in a breath and holds it stubbornly before responding, “I’ll breathe if we...when...we find Kolya.”</p>
    <p>There is an air of mild judgement from the elder.</p>
    <p>There is also a harsh knock on the door, followed by a familiar voice, “I have a door this time!”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora’s head snaps in the direction of the door, her expression cracking slightly with relief.  “It...It is a fine door indeed you bring, but I would like to see your face as well today.”</p>
    <p>Rasputin raises an Eyebrow.</p>
    <p>The door swings open to reveal the Tourist standing with arms folded. She is flanked by Allophryne, who is giving her a bemused look, and a spyhunter, who is giving her an outright confused look. Further down the hall is Blinkin, flanked by several extremely concerned looking spyhunters.</p>
    <p>“Hello, Shyrendora,” Bryti gives her a slight bow, “I hear you need some assistance.”</p>
    <p>“You have heard correctly, and then some,” Shyrendora tiredly states and makes a motion to dismiss the spyhunters, “Thank you.”</p>
    <p>Rasputin does a tiny shuffle dance around the desk but remains a… respectable distance away still. </p>
    <p>Bryti motions to Allophryne. The pair enters, followed very slowly by the alligator. This might be cause for concern, until Allophryne shoos him into a corner then sits on him like a wide leather sofa.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t get a chance to introduce you,” Bryti says to Shyrendora, “This is Allophryne. He is… my apprentice. Blinkin was a package deal.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora turns her gaze to Allophryne and gives him a formal bow of her head, “A blessing of Echos to officially meet you.”</p>
    <p>She stands slowly from her desk and makes a half-hearted gesture at the gangly dark elf slowly scooting his way closer to Bryti, “That is my Uncle.  Well...not my Uncle.  Everyone calls him that.”</p>
    <p>Rasputin does a tiny bow at his waist with a grin, “Rasputin.  Is a pleasure to meet new faces.” </p>
    <p>Bryti blinks, apparently surprised to be meeting a dark elf that’s taller than her, “Ah. Quite so, Rasputin. Tourist will do, for me.” She returns the bow.</p>
    <p>His grin turns a little sharper as he sniffs lightly.  “Is good to finally know who Little Dora’s mysterious friend is.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora makes a pained noise and looks like she wants to sink back down into her chair, or possibly under the desk.  “Uncle, now is not the time for that.  At all.”</p>
    <p>He waves a hand but takes a respectful step back out of Bryti’s space.</p>
    <p>“You’re right,” Bryti looks to Shyrendora, “If your Captain <i>has</i> been afflicted, every moment counts. If it’s even still possible to save him, the chances of doing so get worse every minute. I know you must be going through sheer madness right now, but we need to get to work right away. I’ll need to know everything you can give me, both about him and his disappearance.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora’s mask breaks a little more to show the fear hiding just barely under the surface.  “His name is Kolya,” she begins quietly as she starts at the beginning and goes through all the details of how he came to be her Captain of the spyhunters.  She then goes over the details that were given to her about his disappearance and the state of his office. </p>
    <p>Bryti rubs her chin and listens carefully to the entire thing before speaking, “We’ll start at his office. It definitely sounds like he was afflicted, even with no clear source. Hm. I’d like to take a look at what was recovered from the spy, as well. Perhaps we can find more information there.”</p>
    <p>She pauses, “No one else is wounded or missing?” </p>
    <p>Shyrendora makes her way around the desk to the door, “It isn’t far.  He stays in the Hilt’Inn usually, even when not working.  No one else was hurt or went missing.  We went over everything that we could, just to be sure.”</p>
    <p>She glances back at Rasputin who makes a shooing gesture at her, “Go, go.  I have paperwork.”</p>
    <p>“Good,” Bryti glances at the two dark elves, “If he was in his office, broke out, and no one was hurt… he was fighting it. If he hasn’t killed anyone yet, and he’s still fighting it… there might be a chance. Let’s go.”</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Kolya’s office hasn’t been touched. With no clues as to how he might have been afflicted, the other spyhunters are terrified of the place. Allophryne and Bryti tackle it  cooperatively. Whatever happened here was extremely violent. His desk is broken in half, with nearly every piece of furniture broken. Shredded scrolls and parchment litter the floor. The two move carefully, not  disturbing anything.</p>
    <p>Bryti moves to the center of the room, behind where the desk was. She briefly closes her eyes, then opens them with a dull blue glow. She only looks around the room for a few moments before ending the effect. She sighs slightly, then kneels down to inspect the desk. She runs her fingers over some gouges near the break in the middle, then smells them.</p>
    <p>“Wolverine,” she speaks softly, “No blood. Only one person was in the room. He is afflicted.” </p>
    <p>“Non, not necessarily,” Allophryne suggests, “<i>Pass Without Trace</i> could hide a second person.  A werewolverine was in the room, mais it might not be him.”</p>
    <p>Bryti pauses, then looks around the room, “That’s… possible, I suppose. As we ah, discovered, the wolf elves can control the affliction to some degree. Hm. It’d have to be deliberate, and they would have to be specifically trying to make the scene look like this. You think he was kidnapped and we are being made to <i>think</i> he’s afflicted?”</p>
    <p>“Someone who ain’t known... uh...”  Allophryne looks around, suspicious of ears against walls, “Someone who what wants ‘im dead, weh.”</p>
    <p>Bryti taps her chin again, then looks to Shyrendora, “This is your home, your man. Thoughts?”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, “Kolya has good instincts.  If he was afflicted and fighting it, he would try to hide.  He wouldn’t want us to find him.”</p>
    <p>She opens her eyes and meets Bryti’s look, “I must voice a fear that if they took him, this could very well also be a trap for you.  Kill two things with one shot.” </p>
    <p>Bryti slowly nods, “Of course it is. Even if he is actually afflicted… <i>especially</i> if he’s afflicted. They’ve used afflicted to draw me out before, no reason they wouldn’t do it again, or make it look like they did. Doesn’t matter. I’m going anyway.”</p>
    <p>“And you will not be alone,” Shyrendora says as she takes steps further into the room.  She absently pulls on a strand of her hair in thought, “He is either further in the tunnels than we have looked currently or on the surface.  Things are...tense to put it mildly and our search in the tunnels has not been as extensive as it could be.”</p>
    <p>She turns around slightly with a curious expression, “Could you… use that spell, Sending, to try and contact him?”</p>
    <p>Bryti pauses, “Yes, actually. I’ve never used it underground, but rock and dirt don’t stop it. If his mind is still intact… well, we should be able to tell by his response. If we’re leaving soon, I don’t want to try more than once. Should leave some magic in case we get in a fight. It’ll take about ten minutes. What should I ask him?”</p>
    <p>It takes a moment of careful calculating before Shyrendora speaks, “Mention that you are the Tourist and mention that I know he was perving on you -”</p>
    <p>“He was <i>what?</i>” Brtyi interrupts. </p>
    <p>“You were suspicious, so he followed you until you dropped your disguise and then reported to me.”  Shyrendora states somewhat simply.</p>
    <p>“I dropped my disguise when I dropped my clothes.” She growls. </p>
    <p>“Hence why I know he was perving on you.  He is very embarrassed about it and thinks that no one knows, but he was doing his job regardless.” </p>
    <p>Allophryne maintains a straight face.  Somehow.</p>
    <p>Bryti takes a deep breath in, then exhales slowly trying very hard not to blush, “Well… fine then. I have to save him now, because we must have words. What else should I tell him?”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora debates before continuing from where she was interrupted, “Tell him that you can help him and ask him to let us know where he is if he is able to.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods, “Give me a moment to prepare the spell.”</p>
    <p>She wipes an area near the corner free of dust, then sits down. She takes off her holy symbol and holds it flat in her lap.</p>
    <p>"How about," Shyrendora says, "I am the Tourist.  Shyrendora says you were perving on me.  I can help you.  Please tell us where you are if you can.'"</p>
    <p>Bryti raises an eyebrow, "'You were perving on me, I can help you'?"</p>
    <p>Shyrendora pauses as Bryti’s implication takes a moment to process, "Uh…"</p>
    <p>"Don't worry," Bryti chuckles, "I'll tweak it a bit." </p>
    <p>She traces a few runes on the ground and begins chanting in Lycan quietly. Her holy symbol begins to glow slightly. It's a boring but annoyingly tense ten minutes before the spell completes.</p>
    <p id="i">"Kolya: Shyrendora says you watched me bathe. Perv. She asked me to save you anyway. I can. We will help you. Where are you? - Tourist"</p>
    <p>There is a tense moment while the spell fades.</p>
    <p>"It went through," Bryti speaks, "He is alive, wherever he is. Now we wait for a reply." </p>
    <p>There are a few moments of silence.</p>
    <p>"He's responding- wait," Bryti closes her eyes.</p>
    <p>"I'm afflicted," Bryti repeats his words aloud, "Don't know how. Can't control it. Sorry. Trying to stay away from everyone. Hiding in the Warrens. Something's moving down here. Please help."</p>
    <p>"That's it, word for word," Bryti looks up at the group.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora is tense and possibly paler than usual.  “The Warrens… smart move.  Also a good place for any kind of ambush.”  She rubs at her forehead with her thumb and continues, “We collapsed the Warrens in our first year here.  The area is full of traps and undead and we haven’t been near it since.” </p>
    <p>"Traps and pitch black tunnels aren't my best environment," Bryti frowns, "Could you get a team together? Any scouts who've been down there? When we find him we should use a smaller group, but backup, people who know the area, and extra eyes would be useful." </p>
    <p>Shyrendora nods, “Kolya was...Kolya is well loved by his team and many people.  It would not be hard to get a small group together.  Also requesting Lady Vahn’s help if she can give it would not be a bad idea for us.”</p>
    <p>Something occurs to her and she goes back to rubbing her temples with a soft groan.  “We will have to be careful.  Make sure the people I gather are loyal to me or at least loyal enough to find Kolya.  The political situation here is… not good to say the least.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods, "Your agents gave us a heads up. Your father?" </p>
    <p>Shyrendora laughs humorlessly, "I had hoped for the longest time that he was dead… but I knew deep down he wouldn't be."</p>
    <p>"It's always the worst ones that don't stay dead," Bryti steps over and puts a hand on her shoulder, "Choose the team carefully. They'll certainly learn my identity. The last thing you need is that rat learning you're friends with the big bad wolf. When we've saved Kolya, I'll stay and talk for a bit if you'd like. That's a promise. In the meantime?"</p>
    <p>Bryti squeezes her shoulder and looks her in the eyes, "Never yield."</p>
    <p>Shyrendora reaches up to gently squeeze the hand on her shoulder with a slight smile.  "Thank you, I never will.  Not to him ever again."</p>
    <p>She straightens and looks to the door, "I have a few ideas of who to ask.  And Vahn will be doing an announced <i>Zone of Truth</i> on the lot of them."</p>
    <p>"Good," Bryti releases her shoulder, "Go, get them prepped as soon as you can. Allophryne and I will go over the office a bit longer, see if we can find anything else." </p>
    <p>"Mais, we should git a look et anyone new t' the area. Maken' sure there ain't a mole diggin' round where one ain't welcome, weh?" Allophryne gives Bryti an assessing look. "Er, mebee I ken do that alone, weh." </p>
    <p>Bryti pauses, then nods, "That's a good idea. Something suspicious is going on here,  that much is certain. The wolf elves know about me, but not you. You'd be less likely to draw attention, and it would make it harder for them to make a connection between us."</p>
    <p>“I’ll leave you both to it, and make sure that I get someone to show you what we recovered from the spy,” Shyrendora says as she remembers that Bryti had mentioned that previously, “I’ll go acquire Lady Vahn and return when she and I have a trustworthy group.”</p>
    <p>With that, she disappears back out the door and into the halls.</p>
    <p>Bryti watches her go. Once they are alone in the room, she turns to Allophryne.</p>
    <p>"We'll be walking into a trap," she speaks quietly, "And you'll be outside it. You have to stay with the backup, or away from that entirely. You're the only one here other than Shy that I trust. If… if I'm making a mistake, and they… just…"</p>
    <p>She stops talking, then whispers to him, "Don't let them take me. Please. If they capture me… do whatever you have to." </p>
    <p>"As you command," Allophryne answers, all seriousness. He gives a salute.</p>
    <p>Bryti laughs slightly, then returns the salute.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The warren is still an unstable and dangerous path. The team stopped at the memorial for Tunnel Rat One to pay their respects to their echoes. Two of the engineers that Shyrendora recruited for this were junior engineers from that team who Volodia had commanded to retreat. They are given a moment.</p>
    <p>Bryti picks up Kolya’s scent near the memorial. It leads deep into the warren. Kolya was wise to go this way, no one has been here in years. On the outskirts, the traps were marked with years-old paint. Kolya’s trail leads deeper inside, far past where anyone had ventured during the war.</p>
    <p>The tunnels are still trapped in many places, though it appears Kolya disabled a few on his way in. It is slow going. The tunnels are extremely unstable. Far from prying eyes, Bryti has assumed her hybrid form to enhance her senses, but her large bulk makes the engineers nervous in the cramped and unstable tunnels. They flank her as she follows the trail, checking for traps and unsafe passages.</p>
    <p>It is slow going. Unable to see as well in the dark, Bryti has put a light spell on her sword. The light isn’t enough to bother eyes, but it’s enough to make the team feel exposed and vulnerable. They stay close together and quiet, quiet enough to hear the scratching noises of skeletons still trapped under the rubble.</p>
    <p>Worse, as they move deeper inside the team finds more of the grim arcane sigils carved into the walls. Bryti steps up to look at one one and starts to comment, but one of the engineers grabs the bewildered werewolf by the tail and yanks her away from it. She starts to protest, but the engineer quietly explains what happened to the last guy that read one. She hears him, and does not look at any more of the sigils.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the team comes to a mostly collapsed tunnel. Bryti sniffs and puts a hand on the rough stones. There are claw marks, climbing up. It is apparent that someone has widened a narrow hole at the top of the rubble pile, wiggling their way through. One of the engineers steps onto the stone to check the hole.</p>
    <p>“Stop,” Bryti commands quietly, causing the engineer to pause, “I smell blood.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora easily dances her way through the group so that she is closer to Bryti.  “Can you tell if it is Kolya’s or someone else’s?” she whispers.</p>
    <p>She shakes her head, "No. Smells stale, maybe a day old. Hrm. More than one person has climbed this. We should be ready for a fight on the other side."</p>
    <p>Bryti pauses, then mumbles a spell. She traces a rune on her chest, then gestures at Shy. Shyrendora feels a tingle in her senses, and then realizes she is suddenly aware of exactly where the werewolf is standing, not only that but her intent and motion, her positioning and tensed muscles.</p>
    <p>“Should help,” Bryti comments, “Us first?”</p>
    <p>The dark elf takes a deep breath and seems to center herself before nodding, “Us first.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora moves over to the hole, peering through it swiftly to get a rough idea of what direction would be best for her to go.  Once she seems satisfied (as satisfied as she can be given the hot mess this is) she climbs through silently.</p>
    <p>She slides quietly through the narrow gap. It seems to have been made for someone larger than her. On the other side, she quietly drops down onto an unsteady rubble-strewn floor. With her darkvision, she still can’t see the ceiling or the other side of the chamber wall.</p>
    <p>From what she can tell, it looks like this was a large cavern that was collapsed by the engineers during the war. Large chunks of rubble and rock litter the room, making the floor almost like gravel as far as her darkvision can see.</p>
    <p>She glances down to see a large dark bloodstain on the ground, with splatter on the rubble behind her. She looks up and across the room. At the edge of her darkvision is a crumpled humanoid form, lying on the ground.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora proceeds towards the crumpled form with caution, well aware that this is more than likely the spring to a trap.  Her eyes continue to scan around for any physical trap that might be laying between her and the body.</p>
    <p>She approaches the body slowly, planting each foot carefully before placing her weight on it. She hears falling rocks and cursing, and glances back. Bryti is struggling to pull her large werewolf body through the narrow gap. She digs in and shoves, causing a small cascade of pebbles as she slides down the rubble pile. The light spell on her sword fills the area around her with dim light.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora looks back at the body. She is close enough to see some details. There is an elven ear poking up from the huddled shape. Shyrendora focuses on it long enough to see that has a layer of fur. She squints and can make out the face of a dead wolf elf, with a look of terror on her face.</p>
    <p>“Shy?” Shyrendora hears a hoarse voice call out.</p>
    <p>She looks up. The light from Bryti’s sword spills across the room. Shy’s darkvision can make out a far wall. There, under a low overhang, she sees the huddled form of Kolya. He’s emaciated and covered in dirt and scratches, wedged under the overhang in a fetal position. He looks at Shyrendora with an expression of terror on his face.</p>
    <p>“<i>Run.</i>” he manages to rasp.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora catches a glint of something on the floor. Reflecting metal, from the light. She glances down. She sees hundreds of gold coins mixed in with the rubble.</p>
    <p>She pivots, trying to shout a warning to Bryti. It’s too late. There is a rumble from beneath the rubble. A shower of rubble and coins erupts from the center of the room.</p>
    <p>From under the pile shoves the massive form of a skeletal dragon. It flings rubble back as it stretches its empty wings. It digs bony claws into the dirt and leans its fleshless head towards Bryti, who scrambles back in shock.</p>
    <p>It opens its mouth and lets loose a dry hissing, groaning noise. It holds for several seconds before stopping, snapping its mouth shut, and rattling teeth stained with dried blood. Dull red points of light in its eye sockets fix on the werewolf.</p>
    <p>Bryti does not wait for instructions. Her mind is made up. She grabs her sword and lifts it over her head. With a howl of challenge, the aura of moonlight covers her and she charges the creature head on.</p>
    <p>She swings her sword in an overhead sweep, striking the skeletal dragon in the face. She drags the blade across its eye socket, carving a deep gouge in the bone. The creature hisses in reply and surges forward.</p>
    <p>The dragon snaps its teeth at the werewolf. She manages to roll sideways, but the shortsword sized teeth rip through her arm. The dragon rears up and swipes its claws wildly. Bryti is driven back as the massive claws hit her in the chest, sparking across her armor. She bumps into the wall and snarls, raising her sword again.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora looks at the dagger in her hand, then at the thirty foot tall undead monstrosity attacking her friend. The dagger seems impossibly tiny. What could she possibly do to it?</p>
    <p>Well, she has to figure that out because she realizes she’s running at it. The dragon’s tail sweeps towards her. She ducks and rolls under it, noting that one of the vertebrae is as big as her head. She slides to a stop next to one of the dragon’s back claws.</p>
    <p>The bone is old and worn, she realizes. With time and the collapse of the ceiling, it is filled with tiny cracks. She flips her dagger like an icepick and jabs it into a crack, wedging it to the hilt. She grips it with both hands and twists, throwing her entire weight into the motion.</p>
    <p>The bone cracks and splinters. The dragon makes a rattling noise and rears back. As it puts weight on the cracked bone it shatters, causing it to stumble on the collapsing leg. Shyrendora feels the burning eyes fix on her as it turns its head to look at her.</p>
    <p>Bryti doesn’t let it look away from her. She hefts her sword like she’s chopping wood and brings it down on the dragon’s exposed neckbones. It tries to twist away as she strikes, dragging a deep gouge into the exposed vertebrae that crackles as it moves.</p>
    <p>The burning eyes snap back to the werewolf. It lunges towards her with open jaws. She hefts her sword sideways, jamming it in the creature’s mouth. As it tries to bite down she twists, shattering teeth. She laughs, then screams.</p>
    <p>The dragon pushes its weight forwards, driving her into the wall. It bites down on the sword, causing more cracking. A claw flashes and draws a splatter of blood from her leg. As she stumbles, it slams the second claw into her. It pierces her armor with a shriek of bending metal. The claw digs into her abdomen and pins her to the wall. She yelps in pain, struggling to keep the jaws from snapping shut on her.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora is moving again, repositioning. She ducks out of the way of a back claw, then one of the creature’s bony wings that it tries to bring down on her. She’s still trying to figure out what to do next when the tail hits her in the chest.</p>
    <p>The breath is driven out of her and she feels a rib crack, but somehow she stays focused. She feels Bryti through the spell, feels her struggling against its strength. Shyrendora remembers the shattering leg bone… and then the deep cut Bryti put in the creature’s neck.</p>
    <p>Before the dragon’s tail has even finished swinging, Shyrendora has grabbed it and swung on top of it. She plants her feet on its spine and lunges forward.</p>
    <p>She is only able to think <i>this is insane</i> as she runs along the spine like a tightrope. The dragon bucks in surprise as she hits its shoulders, swinging its head back to stare at her. She sees the crack in its spine, just at the base of its head. She takes her chance.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora plants her feet on a wingbone and hurls herself at the creature’s neck. As she grabs hold she wedges the dagger in the cracked neckbone. The world swirls as the dragon tries to buck her off. She grabs onto a vertebrae and holds on for dear life. She lashes out and kicks the dagger. The bone splinters, but it’s not enough. </p>
    <p>Without another thought, Shyrendora throws herself at the planted dagger. She grabs it, plants her legs on the dragons’ backwards pointing horns, coils her entire body like a spring, and launches herself sideways, twisting the dagger with everything she has.</p>
    <p>There is a crack, and a pop. Shyrendora is falling through open air. She tries to duck and roll, but she hits the rocky ground flat on her back. The air is driven from her lungs in an instant. As she struggles to breathe, something slams into the ground next to her.</p>
    <p>She looks over to see the burning red eye of the dragon. She sucks in a breath of terror… but nothing happens. Over a couple seconds, the red coal of light fades and disappears. As she catches her breath, Shyrendora hears an enormous clatter somewhere behind her. She looks back along the creature’s neck to see what happened… and it’s not there.</p>
    <p>She has somehow completely removed the dragon’s skull from the rest of the skeleton.</p>
    <p>The rest of the undead beast hits the ground in a jumble, unsorted bones clattering into a pile.</p>
    <p>A massive, almost manic laugh echoes through the chamber. Still bleeding badly, Bryti staggers to Shyrendora’s side. She has a huge, ear-to-ear tooth filled grin. She offers Shyrendora a hand.</p>
    <p>“That,” she snarls, “was <i>beautiful.</i>”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora takes a tiny moment to let everything sink in and then takes the offered hand.  “Well…” she mutters with a heavier accent than usual, “that happened.” </p>
    <p>Bryti pulls her to her feet. She plants a couple of healing spells on both of them, glancing at the hole punched in her armor in annoyance.</p>
    <p>"We'll brag about it later," her tone calms, "I heard a voice just before it appeared. Did you see Kolya?" </p>
    <p>Shyrendora immediately turns to the overhang where she saw him huddled before the dragon happened.  “Kolya,” she walks her way over to him and cautiously kneels down a slight distance away from his space, “we’re here.  It’s gone.  We can help.”</p>
    <p>Kolya’s wide eyes slowly focus on Shyrendora. He speaks in a shaky and dry voice, “I-I came down here to hide, so I wouldn’t hurt anyone. They… the wolf elves, they were hunting me. Trying to catch me. I didn’t let them, had to run deeper. Crawled my way in here. They followed me. Chased me in a corner. It… it woke up.” </p>
    <p>He blinks, looking around at the dead dragon and wolf elves. His eyes fix on Bryti, standing a few feet back from Shyrendora. He looks more afraid than when he saw the dragon. </p>
    <p>He looks back to Shy and whispers, “Is she going to kill me?”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora looks back at Bryti and then to Kolya with a soft smile, “No.  She is going to help save you.  And then possibly punch you, but not kill you.”</p>
    <p>She holds out a hand to him, “I trust her, otherwise she would not be here.  Please, Kolya, let’s get you out of here and -”</p>
    <p>“She should,” his voice shudders, “I want to hurt you. Want to kill you. I <i>won’t.</i> I won’t. Don’t let me. Please-”</p>
    <p>Bryti walks past Shyrendora. She kneels next to Kolya and touches him with a <span class="tooltip">spell<span class="tooltiptext">Calm Emotions</span></span>. Kolya stops talking, then heaves a few breaths. He lowers his head as a few tears streak down his face.</p>
    <p>He takes Shyrendora’s hand.</p>
    <p>“It’s only three days until the full moon,” Bryti tells him quietly, “You have held it back with great courage. You only need a little longer. We will help you. I will save you from it. I promise.”</p>
    <p>Kolya silently nods, then looks to Shyrendora.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora breaks just slightly and pulls the young Captain into an uncharacteristic hug.</p>
    <p>Her voice is soft when she speaks, “Lady Vahn will be with you as well to help if you feel yourself slipping.  You are not alone, Kolya.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” despite the spell a few small tears cut through the dust on his face.</p>
    <p>Bryti stands and puts a hand on Shyrendora’s shoulder, “It won’t be as bad as it was with Hunger. He’s only been through one full moon. It has less hold on him. We will need somewhere secluded to wait it out, but… with Vahn and anyone else you can spare helping, he’ll make it.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora nods, “I’ll see who I can gather and find you all a safe space to be in.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods solemnly, then glances at the fallen dragon skull, “Do you need a new office decoration?” </p>
