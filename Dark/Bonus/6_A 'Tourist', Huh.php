<h1>A 'Tourist,' Huh?</h1>

<p>Shyrendora is outwardly calm, casually weighing the options in front of her.</p>
<p>There is roughly 180 pounds of badger lounging in front of her only good escape from her office.  That way is certain failure, and yet she toys fondly with it as a preferable thing.</p>
<p>"What were you even thinking?!  Oh wait, no, I know exactly what you were thinking-"</p>
<p>There isn't really a good window out of her office.  She should see about getting one put in - for emergencies only of course.</p>
<p>"-I'm Shyrendora and I love putting myself at risk instead of-"</p>
<p>Going invisible was out of the question; it wouldn't do her any good against that wiggling nose.</p>
<p>"-thinking about my own safety for once!  Are you even-"</p>
<p>She could jump over the badger.  It would take some clever coordination to open the door at the same time, but surely she could do that before the badger got her.  Soft snorts from the creature almost dare her to try it and see how fabulously it would fail.</p>
<p>A sharp yank on her ear forces her to finally look at her rather irate friend.  "Ow.  I was listening, you know."</p>
<p>Trischal's cheeks and ears are flushed with indignation.  "You were plotting how to get around Fuzzy so you could avoid me again."</p>
<p>She flicks the ear that was yanked, trying to rid herself of the feeling.  “Believe it or not, I am capable of listening to you and plot ways to flee from this conversation that I really do not want to have.”</p>
<p>Her sarcasm obviously falls on unappreciative ears.  </p>
<p>“She could have killed you.  If she really was who you wanted us to look out for, she could have killed you.”  There is a wavering note there that continues, “Why did you go alone?”</p>
<p>That seems to be everyone’s favorite question.</p>
<p>She refuses to sigh.  It feels like she has been sighing non-stop for months now.</p>
<p>Instead, she goes over her reasoning once more.  “If you had come with me, or any scouts for that matter, could you have promised to keep yourself from edging into hostilities with her?  I know you just as well as you claim to know me, Trischal.  You would have made your words pointed and careless, your posture and tone unfriendly.  Echos forbid the thought of Fuzzy also being there…” she rubs the space above the bridge of her nose idly and continues, “I do not need more deaths on my hands, Trish,  I have enough of them already.”</p>
<p>Trischal is silent for a few heartbeats before her tone turns bitter, “You promised you wouldn’t do something like that again.  When we finally found you the last time…” she trails off, big eyes glassy with pain and memories.</p>
<p>The memory flash doesn’t surprise her.  She had actually been waiting for Trischal to fall into one much sooner than she had.  Apparently, so had Fuzzy if the badger’s sudden presence by his friend’s side is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Shyrendora glances at the now free doorway, but stays.  She dug this grave years ago.  “I am sorry, Trish.  This was different and I had no intentions of potentially dying this time around.”  She shifts her head some, giving Trischal movement to hone in on.  “I am still very much alive, and not even hurt this time.  All we did was talk.”</p>
<p>It takes a few more moments but the hunter’s fingers finally reach down to card comfortingly through Fuzzy’s fur as her eyes sharpen once more.  The fight from before is tempered by a weariness that Shyrendora is very familiar with, “Fine...alright.  You talked, wonderful.  Suddenly she gives you a sob story and you just let her carry on? Deem her not a threat?”</p>
<p>She leans back against her desk, crossing her arms and looking to the ceiling for some kind of patience.  “It was one piece of a whole and not really a sob story.  Was it angled in a way to evoke emotional sympathy?  Yes.  Did it work?  Yes.  However, I am well aware that what she told me is not her whole or even sole reason for doing whatever it is that she is doing, trust me enough to know that.”</p>
<p>She looks back down to her friend, meets her eyes and holds them steadily.  “The important thing here is that she was not here to cause or bring trouble to us.  She can be a threat, but was not one currently.  She was a guest, she left as a guest, and I now have more questions than answers for the time being.”</p>
<p>Those piercing blue eyes and parting “Never yield” had been nagging at her thoughts rather frequently.</p>
<p>Trischal seems contemplative, her eyes glancing down away from Shyrendora’s gaze.  Fuzzy snorts softly at her side.  Her voice is muted as she mutters in thought, “A werewolf as a guest who means no harm and weird elves who tried to break into my office...Echos preserve my sanity.”</p>
<p>That makes her bite back a smile.  While prone to her paranoia on certain matters, she knew that Trischal would see the point she was making.  Her friend was sharp and that was one of the main reasons why it made sense to have her take over as scoutmaster.</p>
<p>There is a huff and Trischal looks back up at her finally.  “I’m still mad at you for being reckless, but I do see your point.”  Her fingers scratch at Fuzzy’s ear while she continues, “I’m assuming only myself and the spy that got you know of this.”</p>
<p>“So far?  Yes.  I was trying to keep it from being a big deal because it turned out to not be a big deal.”</p>
<p>The look turns into a minor glare.</p>
<p>Indeed still mad then.  It’s a good thing she has no intention of letting Trischal know about the bag of soap she oh-so casually left outside of the Tourist’s room before she left.  That would not have gone over well either.</p>
<p>She muses that in another point of time, Trischal probably would have loved trading sarcasm with the Tourist.  </p>
<p>It’s an interesting thought and one that will lead her down the descent of “what-ifs” if she doesn’t cut it off immediately.</p>
<p>“Well I hope your curiosity was satisfied at least.”</p>
<p>Oh but it wasn’t.  That was the problem wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Katya Vatik was a fuzzy enigma weighing in the back of her mind.  The name was likely a coincidence and not her actual name, but it still caught her attention after listening to Ehra muse at the potluck.</p>
<p>She had expected to get some answers out of that encounter, at least in a round-about way.  The most important one being if her people were in immediate danger from the werewolf.  That one was answered just fine.  Everything else was a toss up and she was still trying to connect the dots.  </p>
<p>There were more dots now too.  </p>
<p>A lot more dots.</p>
<p>“Hellooo, anyone in the cavern?”</p>
<p>Shyrendora snaps her attention to the hand waving in her face.  Well shit.  “Lost in thought, pay me no mind.”</p>
<p>Trischal looks less than impressed.  Fuzzy somehow manages to make the same expression.</p>
<p>She gives up and finally sighs, making a mental note to drink every time she sighs from now on.  Might even put her into a coma for a bit.  “Look, if I make any solid theories about everything in general, I will let you know.  For now, I have nothing but a headache and a lot of questions that are not going to be answered any time soon.”</p>
<p>Her friend looks like she wants to poke more, but leans back slightly out of their shared space.  “I do trust you, Shy.  Just...not really when it comes to your own well-being.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora waves her hands at her.  “This is nothing new.  Now shoo, we have other pressing matters that do not involve yammering about a peaceful guest.”</p>
<p>There is a lot of squinting in response but eventually Trischal does as requested, leaving Shyrendora once again alone in her office.</p>
<p>She debates for a few moments about locking the door and curling up under her desk.</p>
<p>It’s a very tempting thought.</p>
<p>She locks and unlocks it a few times before deciding to leave it unlocked.  If Trischal wanted in again, a locked door wouldn’t do much against a raging badger and his very determined hunter.</p>
<p>Instead she takes a grounding swig from her flask, noting that she was probably going to have to ask Greg to make more soon, and walks back over to her desk.  She flops bonelessly into the chair and sinks.</p>
<p>Never yield.</p>
<p>Never yield in kindness?  Never yield in being a fool?</p>
<p>She can’t help but snort out a laugh, she’s pretty sure she has at least the last one covered.</p>
<p>The headache builds and she rubs a thumb hard against her forehead.  Getting vague encouragement from a werewolf was the absolute last thing she had ever expected to experience in her lifetime.</p>
<p>She stares at the ceiling and bounces her thumb idly in place, trying to will her brain into working faster on some unknown problem.  Confusing encouragement aside, she was also still uncertain if the Tourist was even aware of the off hide-and-seek conundrum that Shyrendora was gleaning from different conversations.</p>
<p>On one hand, she appeared to be a model of the one doing the seeking.  She was self-assured and seemed to have a relative goal in mind for the places she was seen traveling.  She did not hide herself, and when she did it didn’t...stick very well.  Perhaps it really just was because she wanted civilization; that had not been a lie and in her mind a rather valid point.</p>
<p>On the other, her gut was screaming at her that something else was going on.  There was a piece missing that she couldn’t see.  It was such a coincidence of timing with the camps outside of Surt and it bugs her to no end.  There was a connection there somewhere, and perhaps she is wrong but she feels like someone is trailing after the Tourist.</p>
<p>She shifts her thumb to her temple and rubs hard to get rid of the annoying stabby headache.</p>
<p>Never yield.</p>
<p>Shyrendora groans and thumps her head against the wood of her chair.  Her mind refuses to leave that bone alone, apparently; always coming back around to it even after she tries to focus on other parts of what she learned.</p>
<p>Why give her encouragement?</p>
<p>It was fairly obvious there were some personal opinions and feelings on the matter, but still.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Shyrendora was simply an elf who didn’t stab a suspicious bathing guest in the back.  She doubts she could have done it, even if that had been her goal.  This place was built with peace and good will in mind and had seen enough violence even before they had settled here.  It didn’t need pointless murder added ontop of it.</p>
<p>She is tired of conflict.</p>
