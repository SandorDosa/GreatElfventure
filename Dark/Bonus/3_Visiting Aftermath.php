<p><b>Visiting Aftermath</b></p>
<p>It had been a couple of days since their guest’s departure and everyone was starting to shift back into their patchworked normal rhythm.  Lots of the curious young ones had stuck to whispering to each other about the unnaturally tall visitor, while Uncle complained loudly about not having gotten a chance to have a “face-to-face” interaction.</p>
<p>There had been one elf that had gotten a pretty good “face-to-face” interaction with the visiting Cryptid, and that elf was currently being a pain to find.</p>
<p>Trischal frowns at the empty room, before she pulls back out into the hallway.  The Hilt’Inn was slowly coming along, but even still - there were not a lot of places a young elf could hide away in.  As it was, Amenidal was usually rubbish at hiding himself away for any length of time, but for some reason he was being very good at it now.</p>
<p>Of course this would be the only time he would ever be good at it.</p>
<p>A soft shuffle from behind her makes her turn her head with a fond smile.  Fuzzy approaches lackidaizally and grunts softly at her in greeting.  She kneels down and ruffles his facial fur gently.  “Hey there buddy, did you sniff him out?”</p>
<p>Fuzzy makes a more forceful grunt and pulls away from her, meandering back up to the higher floor of the Hilt’Inn.</p>
<p>With the help of her companion, it takes no time at all to find the room that the young elf is housed in.  She finds it mildly amusing that he chose to hide himself away in one of the farthest and smallest rooms available on the second floor, it was so opposite of his personality that she knew for a fact he was trying to hide something.</p>
<p>Trischal lets Fuzzy enter the room first to see if Amenidal notices anything aside from his mutters and the scratches of something on paper.  Fuzzy ends up sitting down right behind the stool the boy is perched upon and there is no change in posture.</p>
<p>A snicker builds in her throat but she holds it back as she makes her way into the room after her companion.  She gives the badger a couple of scratches on the top of his head before peering over Amenidal’s thin shoulders to see what he was scribbling.</p>
<p>She can’t really make heads or tails of it so she settles for leaning as close as she dares.  “Whatcha doing?”</p>
<p>Amenidal’s shriek and full body fling away from her finally lets loose the snicker she had been holding back.  Her ears were ringing painfully, but that had been worth it.  The younger elf she had basically adopted as a brother was wide eyed and had his back plastered to the opposite wall.</p>
<p>“Scoutmaster T-Trischal!  Don’t do that!”  His hand presses against his chest as if to calm the more than likely racing organ held within.</p>
<p>She lets her snickering continue for a while before stooping to pick up the paper he had been taking notes on.  “Sorry squeak, it’s what you get for hiding away for so many days.”  Her eyes travel over the paper curiously, “Speaking of, what have you been...doing…” she trails off and frowns some.</p>
<p>Amenidal makes panicked noises from his wall.  “N-Nothing!  I was just...planning out a tattoo is all.”</p>
<p>Her eyebrows raise as she looks up to him, sees his bright red face, and then looks back down to the paper.</p>
<p>The notes are all shorthand and a scribble of mess in Amenidal's atrocious handwriting, but the drawings immaculate and well detailed.</p>
<p>She knows exactly what the tattoo is.  She is not sure how to feel about this development.  "No one here has such a tutelage marking."  She stares hard into his eyes and watches him squirm some before squaring his shoulders.  "You are creating a rather ... personal tutelage mark for an outsider."</p>
<p>Amenidal’s face is still red but his head tilts stubbornly upwards, ears quivering up and down.  “Just because no outsider has had one before doesn’t mean that we can’t start making them.  The surface elves are a part of our stories now.”</p>
<p>The parchment is placed back on the table so she can rub her temples with her fingers.  A headache is building, she can feel it.  “So...you are making a tutelage mark...for our most recent visitor.  Who you also have a giant and unprecedented crush on.”</p>
<p>“I- look that’s not-!  I don’t have- um!  It’s...unrelated!  He just showed me some things that I feel have helped me make a new branch in myself.  New options for the future.  That’s all!” His hand flutters to the tattoo on his arm, almost protectively.  She does not miss the movement and the headache doubles in size.  While she and Uncle had been listening in to the conversation, they had not seen anything that had happened, and boy she feels like she is missing a detail somewhere.</p>
<p>“A tutelage mark.  A personal tutelage mark.  I’m not dumb, Amenidal, I can see the tones in your lines.  Something else happened.”  She squints again at the hand lightly touching his tattoo.</p>
<p>It clicks.</p>
<p>A sharp breath in.  “He’s an outsider, Amenidal.  It didn’t mean anything.”</p>
<p>Amenidal presses his lips together and glares slightly.  “I’m not a child anymore.  I know that he was unaware of what he did.  The significance of it…” there is something wavering in his voice but he cuts it off swiftly.  “It doesn’t change the fact that he still helped me learn something that I think is important.”</p>
<p>Trischal stares at the young elf, trying hard to look past her personal bias on his age and to the young adult he had become.  The fear of it creeps up her spine and all she can see are the faces of his parents staring back at her.  “No Chronicler will put that on you.  They won’t recognize or respect the mark you have fashioned for Ink.”</p>
<p>His chin raises a bit higher and there is something determined in his eyes.  “I wasn’t going to ask.  I was going to do it myself.”</p>
<p>A hand goes down to pet Fuzzy while the other returns to rubbing her temple.  “Yourself?  But you haven’t been trained.  You haven’t…”  She cuts herself off, obviously missing more information.</p>
<p>Amenidal was going to be the death of her.</p>
<p>She was going to have to talk with Shyrendora about this.</p>
