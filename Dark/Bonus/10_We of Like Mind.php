<h1>We of Like Mind</h1>

<p>“What do you even need the blood for?”  Vahn asks, almost sounding amused rather than curious.</p>
<p>Greg gives her a side-eyed glance as they walk down the halls back towards the main part of the Hilt’Inn.  “A pet project, you could say.  You know, things I actually like doing instead of being shoved into a spotlight of responsibility?”</p>
<p>The surly cleric raises her hands in mock defense, for sure showing signs of amusement now at his eternal suffering.  “The people chose you my dear, grumpy friend.  Try to take it as a compliment one of these days.”</p>
<p>He grumbles, “Why am I even friends with you?”</p>
<p>She grins wickedly, all of her attractive, pointy teeth on display.  “Because if our positions were reversed, you would be giving me just as much grief over it.”</p>
<p>He can’t really argue with her on that.  The amount of times he has imagined the reverse scenario alone is enough proof of the truth in what she said.  “... Fair.”</p>
<p>There is a momentary pause, where he thinks she is going to finally leave him alone, before he hears, “So … what kind of pet project?  Going to try and clone the guana with your alchemy?”</p>
<p>He gives her a flat look.  Their differing views on magic were always such fun conversations that he really didn’t feel like getting into today.  He goes for a low blow in hopes that she will piss off, “Shouldn’t you be busy trying to crawl up Calestros’ cave or whatever it is you devout people do in your free time?”</p>
<p>Sure enough, that gets him an irritated ear flick but not much else.  Her voice still sounds amused when she speaks, “The Mother Echo is within all of us.  We need not look for the source when she can easily be heard all around us.”</p>
<p>Greg rolls his eyes.  It’s not that he didn’t believe in Calestros - he just didn’t feel a burning need to make it a huge central part of his life.  She was there, she existed, and she didn’t need him to scream her praises from a cavern cliff to continue existing.  That’s what people like Vahn were for.</p>
<p>“Some of us are just more keen on listening to her than others.”</p>
<p>“I listen just fine, thanks.”  He smacks her hand away before she can flick his ear.</p>
<p>She huffs from his side.  “Sure you do.”</p>
<p>They finally arrive at the base floor of the Hilt’Inn.  It would seem the commotion of the past night has not deterred the guests any, which he is sure Rasputin is grateful for.  There are plenty of faces he has seen around as well as some new ones who must have just checked in for the day.</p>
<p>With about as much as Rasputin loves and thrives off of this Inn, Greg hates it.</p>
<p>There are too many people here that expect him to interact and have conversations.  It’s exhausting and one of the reasons why he refused to get an office in the damn building.  Trischal and the very reluctant new Domawit could have fun sleeping in their offices like workaholics, but he refused to be so easily accessible to strangers.</p>
<p>Greg steers them towards the tunnel that will lead to Nadezhda Caverns.  As he does so, he spots Kolya off to the side having a conversation with one of the guests.  Vahn must spot him at the same time because her attention turns towards the doctorly and he is more than grateful for the shift.  This means she is finally going to leave him alone.</p>
<p>Her hand softly pats his uncovered shoulder.  “Mother Echo guide you in whatever the hell you are going to do with that blood.”  Her voice is annoyingly sure and sincere.</p>
<p>His shoulder is warm where she made contact and he rolls it some.  Her touches were one of the few he allows, but the contact still bothers him sometimes.  He watches her go and gets a minor amusement from how Kolya seems to snap to attention when he spots the cleric approaching.</p>
<p>“Mother Echo guide me indeed,” he mutters before continuing on his way.</p>
<p>The walk through the tunnel is blissfully conversation free.  He revels in it and even slows his pace some to enjoy it.</p>
<p>When he finally hits the cavern itself, most of the dark elves there simply ignore him.  They are more than happy to go about their business in the same way that he is.  He spots a few of their engineers up on one of the bigger crystal clusters, making gestures and talking amongst themselves.</p>
<p>They probably have some kind of plan that they are trying to work out for future building projects.</p>
<p>Greg doesn’t really stop to fully take in the sights of their new home.  He’d done that enough earlier on when he was trying to find the perfect spot for his work hut.  The engineers had been more than happy to work with him on a feasible design for the area he had chosen.</p>
<p>He approaches one of the far back corners of the cavern, one that is well covered by jutting logs of crystal.  He ducks through one of the open spaces and comes up into what he was lovingly making into his new work hut.</p>
<p>It was sparse for the moment, with a desk and makeshift bed being the only real furniture.  He did note that someone had been working to carve a bookshelf for him into the rock wall.  Excellent.</p>
<p>It wasn’t anything like his old one, especially considering some of the supplies he had to leave behind, but it was shaping up.</p>
<p>He had time to make it just as good, if not better, than the old one.</p>
<p>Greg situates himself at his desk and pulls a small vial of blood out of his pouch of supplies.</p>
<p>Amenidal’s spell casting had used a bit of the blood, but Shyrendora had obviously struck pretty well with the amount that was still available.</p>
<p>He lifts it high and stares at it in thought, finger tapping the side of the glass lightly.  He could do a couple of things with it, but would have to be sparing in his use.  A lot of blood there was, but it was still a very finite amount in terms of potential experimentation. </p>
<p>People more than likely think that he is going to attempt to scry on the blood to find out where the spy is.  The idea is ridiculous and he’s not going to even give it a thought.  He wasn’t of  a mind to go pointlessly chasing after a spy that did not seem to gain whatever information that they were looking for.  None of them currently have access to a scrying spell or device anyway, so that made it even more of a moot point.</p>
<p>Chasing the spy was pointless.  Keeping that spy and more from potentially showing up, however …</p>
<p>That was something he is more than willing to place his interest in.</p>
<p>It will obviously take time, but this is the first pet project he has had since the War.  He is more than fine with it taking time.</p>
<p>He gathers notes as well as his own copy of the blood biography spell and sets them up on his desk.  They used spells like that to help note bloodlines for their records, so it only made logical sense that he could do the same but with wards.  He knows there is a ward that Vahn could do in theory, but he doesn’t feel like asking her for help.</p>
<p>He makes minor notes of the spells he would like to look into and try to combine … begrudgingly putting the warding glyph on there.</p>
<p>“Ah ha!  Of course you hide away in hovel.  Was first thing you insisted be built for you.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a hovel, you hack.”  He responds automatically, no longer surprised by Rasputin’s ability to randomly show up without a sound.  The old bat wasn’t even that good at sneaking.</p>
<p>There are sounds of movement this time before a very boney chin rests itself atop his head.  He can see the elder’s hands making gestures out of the corners of his eyes.  “Sorry, sorry!  Work hut is much better.  Very creative.”  He can hear the implied air quotes as the words vibrate against his skull.</p>
<p>He rolls his eyes but allows the chin to stay on his head.  “What do you want, Rasputin?”</p>
<p>Long fingers tap against his shoulders, one tracing a sigil there before coming to rest again.  “Want to see what favorite Gniewko is doing.  I heard there was much excitement.”  There is a pause and then a very loud sniff.  “Aaah, blood and note taking.  Taking notes on blood?”</p>
<p>Greg doesn’t even question anymore how Rasputin does half of the things he does.  “In a manner.”</p>
<p>The chin shifts against his hair as a sign of the elder tilting his head.  The hands on his shoulders turn into arms and he can feel Rasputin’s torso against his back.  “You already have notes on blood, then.  So what do you do with blood?”</p>
<p>He shifts on his chair to try and get more comfortable under Rasputin’s weight.  “Amenidal cast blood biography on it already, so we know the details.  I want to take those details down to a bloodline and make a ward of ‘not you’.”</p>
<p>“Mmm…” the presence hums and Greg can hear the gears turning in that ancient cavern of a brain.  “Doing by bloodline ensures you catch more than just owner of blood.  Make a specific and yet generalized ward.”</p>
<p>He leans back into Rasputin some with a huff.  “That’s what I said, you bat.”  He tilts his head back some to stare at the sharp features above him.  “Are you going to hover like this the whole time I’m working?”</p>
<p>Rasputin’s expression is mostly hidden from his sight but he can feel the grin in his words, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Greg valiantly ignores the itch to lean back until the old bat goes toppling over.  It wouldn’t be very hard to do, but he is not sure he wants to be taken down off of his chair with him.  Those arms were deceptive in their ability to remain wrapped around things.</p>
<p>Instead, he shifts himself into a better sitting position once more, using the movement of his head to jostle the chin still resting there.  He is rewarded by the sound of Rasputin’s teeth clicking together painfully at the abrupt shift.</p>
<p>There is a tiny, “ow...rude…” before his invaded space becomes silent again.</p>
<p>Greg manages to write maybe two words before the silence breaks again, much to his eternal aggravation.  “So, warding glyph?  Vahn might have advice on that.  Could take it and poke together with information of blood biography.”</p>
<p>A sigh is building.  He can feel it in his very soul.  “I already thought of that, thanks.  I had also debated on somehow enchanting a pen with zone of truth, but don’t really want to collaborate with her for that long on magic bullshit.”</p>
<p>There is a very audible pout from the elder.  “That was next suggestion...is good suggestion...and funny outcome potential.”</p>
<p>The sigh escapes.  “I’ll bring it up to her in like...a week or something.”</p>
<p>The lounging dark elf perks up at that.</p>
