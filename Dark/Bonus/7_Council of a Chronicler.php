<h1>Council of a Chronicler</h1>

<p>The sounds of picks against stone vibrate through his bones like a well sung song.  It is invigorating to listen to and fills him with a glee like no other.  If he had the strength for it today, he would be up and poking around at how everyone was doing, mentally recording their excitement for the project to put into lines later for their histories.  As it was, Gniewko threatened to tie him to a stalagmite if he so much as tried to get up and move around - so here he is, sitting and humoring his favorite pupil.</p>
<p>Soft foot falls draw him back down from the work and stone to his present body.  He knows those foot falls well, and knows that they are usually much softer.  Shyrendora always makes herself louder when approaching him; an endearing trait that he doubts she is even aware of doing anymore.</p>
<p>“Little ‘Dora!  How can I help you?”</p>
<p>Her breathing sounds carefully measured to his ears.  “Uncle … I seek council.”</p>
<p>Seek council?  He laughs, boisterously, but still offers out his hand as is the custom when such a request is voiced to him as Head Chronicler.</p>
<p>Small hands cup his as he listens to the sounds of her kneeling before him.  Her forehead lays against the center of his palm and soft moisture drips onto his fingers.</p>
<p>Ah.  It is hard for him to recall the last time Shyrendora willingly cried in his presence; she is usually too proud to allow anyone to witness her in such a way.</p>
<p>“Well then, Little ‘Dora, you have my attention.  What council do you seek this day?”</p>
<p>No response is forthcoming aside from her measured breaths.  He gives her time to collect her thoughts; he is stuck here today whether he likes it or not and is in no rush.</p>
<p>Instead, he contemplates the young woman in front of him.  Fierce, proud, loyal - and under it all, painfully kind.  The weight of the people is a hard burden to shoulder, but he finds that she has been doing well enough under the pressures of it.  He is fairly certain he knows what prompted this request, considering all of the recent events.  There is only one demon that he knows of that could get under Shyrendora’s carefully crafted armor so easily.</p>
<p>He lets the silence continue before breaking it softly, “Is this perhaps, about old words echoing much farther than they have reason to?”</p>
<p>She breathes in sharply, “Am I a fool, Uncle?”</p>
<p>He raises his eyebrows at that question.  “Technically we are all fools, in one respect or another.”</p>
<p>That earns him a dry laugh.  “What greater fool than she who leads her people to ruin?”</p>
<p>The eyebrows go a little higher.  “Curious, I have seen many fools but not one you speak of.”</p>
<p>Her words rip from her, worn and raw.  “We needed to change, Uncle.  I forced us to change and now -”</p>
<p>“If memory serves, you forced none to follow you.  Gave option to go about and do their own thing, da?  You would have gone and done it alone, if needed.  A fool you are, but not quite that kind of fool.”</p>
<p>With his interruption, he feels the tension building in her hands and knows it is wound tightly through her whole body.  He lifts his other hand and places it gently against the back of her head.  “We are not dead yet, Little ‘Dora.  You do yourself and the people a disservice by letting the words of a cold man control your emotions so.”</p>
<p>Another laugh rattles hollowly from her.  “I helped save others at the cost of our people.  Our Home.  I thought I could keep them safe...keep our home safe.”</p>
<p>He shrugs softly to himself.  “You did not fully think of consequences at current time, but when they came you did the best you could with what you had.”  In his mind’s eye, he sees the angry young child she was - constantly fighting against an unfair moral code with a painful kindness that her father couldn’t snuff out no matter how hard he tried.  He continues as he gently rubs the back of her head, still feeling the moisture on his other hand, “Are we facing hardships due to this?  Da, of course we are.  So are others.  However, the people are still alive, and making a new Home.  And many others are alive as well thanks to your actions.”</p>
<p>“If I had just ignored it...kept on like he wanted me to, maybe the Lycans would have overlooked us for longer. “</p>
<p>A snort leaves him at that.  “They knew where we were, it was only matter of time before they stopped feeling deterred by tunnels.”  He shakes his head and shifts in his sitting position some.  “Would you, Little ‘Dora, honestly have been able to ignore the needs of others?  That sounds very unlike the you I know.”</p>
<p>She is silent at the question, her mind obviously churning with too many thoughts.</p>
<p>“Let me put it this way then,” he tries a different angle, “if you could go back and stop yourself from helping those first few surfacers, would you?  Would you have looked them in the eye and turned away?”</p>
<p>She seems to choke for a second, sucking in air harshly and letting it out in short bursts.  He respectfully ignores it for the sake of her pride.  When she speaks, though, he can hear the hard steel in her strained voice.  “No.”</p>
