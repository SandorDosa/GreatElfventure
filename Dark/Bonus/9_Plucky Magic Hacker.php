<h1>Plucky Magic Hacker</h1>

<p>The bite of cold in the air from the season seeps through the halls of the Hilt’Inn despite the fires that are going in the scattered hearths.  Most of the guests are already tucked away for the night in their respective rooms, many of them not being nocturnal like the dark elves.  There are a few who still wander the halls, having been startled awake by a rather loud yell for action.</p>
<p>Those halls were currently thick with tension as Amenidal bolts swiftly through them.</p>
<p>He had tried to help block off exists once the call had gone out, but he figures that was more of a show that they were trying to do something.  Whoever had been here was probably long gone.</p>
<p>Shyrendora’s voice calling for action and a medic rings in his ears.  Earlier, he had seen Kolya being carried to the designated medic room by two of their alchemists who he recognized as some of Greg’s colleges.  Something bad had happened.</p>
<p>Heart in his throat, he follows the path that he saw the alchemists come from until he arrives at a specific storage room in the basement.</p>
<p>The door is wide open and he can see Greg and a cleric, Vahn he thinks her name was, talking quietly off to the side; their hands gesturing as they discuss something that probably relates to Kolya.</p>
<p>He takes a step inside and hovers there, trying to take everything in while his mind spins.</p>
<p>Kolya had been slowly creeping up the scout ranks before this.  There had even been talk of the possibility of making him the head of a new division of spyhunters that would be posted for the Hilt’Inn specifically.  Obviously, Trischal was very impressed with how he and a few others had been handling the stresses of keeping an eye on so many new faces.</p>
<p>Trischal’s voice is hard and angry somewhere to his left, “You are not about to defend this spy.  I swear by every Echo I will not-”</p>
<p>“I am not defending him.  I am mainly saying that storming off to Surt when we know nothing is not the way to handle this.”  Shyrendora’s voice is there too, calmer in a way but there is something else that he can’t grasp at the moment.</p>
<p>He glances over to them and sees Trischal hovering angrily in Shyrendora’s space, as the later simply remains casually leaned against one of the wine racks.  He does not see Fuzzy, which remains to be seen as either a good or bad thing.</p>
<p>The scoutmaster continues hotly, “They’ll talk when I have my foot shoved up their a-”</p>
<p>“Trischal!  Enough!  We don’t know if he was following the Triumvirate’s orders or if he was a rogue agent acting for someone else or even on his own.”  Shyrendora crosses her arms as she says this; the only sign of her own agitation on the matter.</p>
<p>“Oh, and you think he was for sure a rogue agent then?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.  There was something off about him and I can’t place it right now, but starting shit with the fire elves is not the way to handle this.”</p>
<p>Amenidal finally looks away from them and stares at the blood on the floor.  His fingers tap nervously against his thigh.  Surely the fire elves wouldn’t do that?  They are a bit high strung, but from what little he knows of them it is pretty damn understandable.  But why spy on them?  What would they gain from this?</p>
<p>They might not be friends per-say but they were allies, right?</p>
<p>What was the point?</p>
<p>Trischal’s voice breaks through his thoughts once more, “You keep saying there was something off about him.  What does that even mean?”</p>
<p>“It means that there were things that occurred that have my suspicions raised, but I have not had time to think them out properly.”</p>
<p>The two of them seem to be going around in continuous circles, probably because Trischal is in her badger rage mode and unable to see the reason that Shyrendora keeps trying to rein her in with.</p>
<p>There is a lot of blood on the floor.  He knows it isn’t Kolya’s as the alchemists didn’t seem to be trying to stop bleeding of any kind.  It must be the spy’s.  They should probably clean it up, or collect it eventually.  It could probably be useful for tracking purposes or…</p>
<p>The fingers that were tapping against his thigh now smack at the book bound to his waist in an attempt to undo it as an idea hits him like a boulder.  Of course!</p>
<p>It is useful!</p>
<p>Very useful!</p>
<p>For more than just tracking too!</p>
<p>“Wonderful!  You can think them out while I’m tracking down this fuck-”</p>
<p>“Trischal-”</p>
<p>Amenidal’s ears quiver as he raises his voice above the arguing, “I can help!”</p>
<p>Silence descends around him.  He looks up from the blood again to see four pairs of eyes looking at him with varying degrees of interest and confusion.</p>
<p>Trischal’s gaze turns hard as recognition sets in, “Amenidal, you shouldn’t be here.”</p>
<p>He clenches his jaw and stands stubbornly in place.  “If you would just let me help for once instead of placing me off to the side, I could try something that might give us a chance at finding out who this spy was.”</p>
<p>“I am not in the mood for you to argue with-” Trischal’s protest cuts off when a hand raises in front of her as a motion for silence.</p>
<p>Shyrendora’s eyes are sharp and curious - willing to give him a chance.  “He can stay.  What do you have in mind, Ameidal?”</p>
<p>That is all the permission he needs.</p>
<p>Immediately, he’s pulling at his spellbook, trying to flip to the page he is thinking of as fast as he can while also giving a rough summary.  “I can ask the blood questions - not like...a conversation or anything but blood holds information, yeah?  Scrap of parchment - I need...I should have…” he trails off into muttering for a moment while he trades turning pages for digging into his component pouch.  “It’s one of the spells all Chroniclers know, or so Uncle told me.”</p>
<p>There is a quiet, “Ah...clever.” from Greg and Vahn’s general direction.  He’s not sure from who specifically, but at this point his mind is too focused to wonder for long.</p>
<p>Trischal’s obvious irate confusion bleeds into her words, “Hold on - how do you even know that spell, Amenidal?”</p>
<p>He pulls his hand out of his component pouch; a small scrap of parchment held victoriously between his fingers, while carefully reading the page he found.  Thankfully the spell isn’t terribly costly component wise or complicated.  “Greg gave it to me.”</p>
<p>She seems to have a moment where her anger and confusion war with each other.  Eventually she gets out, “What the - Greg what the fuck?”</p>
<p>Amenidal glances up minutely from his reading to watch the exchange while trying to figure out if he has a regular page of parchment somewhere close by.</p>
<p>The elf in question shrugs his shoulders, sounding both bored and amused when he responds.  “He wanted to learn more spells.  I couldn’t teach it to him and neither could Uncle, so I just gave him a Chronicler’s book.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora even pipes in now, “...You stole a Chronicler’s spellbook...why?”</p>
<p>He snorts before responding in a dry monotone, “Because I didn’t like him.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?”  Trischal sounds exasperated now, which is an improvement from the rage mode she had started in.</p>
<p>“He called Rasputin a crusty old hack.”  A pause, his ears twitching half-heartedly, “Which he is.  But he’s my crusty old hack.”</p>
<p>Vahn makes a noise similar to someone choking on a laugh, her fist covering her mouth like a shield.  Greg glares at her and she clears her throat innocently, a wicked smile playing behind her fist.</p>
<p>Amenidal bites back a smile of his own and pulls some rolled parchment out of a different hip pouch; also ‘gifted’ to him by Greg.  </p>
<p>For totally legitimate purposes of NOT stealing other people’s spellbooks again.</p>
<p>He sets himself down as close to the blood as he can get without actively sitting on it, crossing his legs and setting out the things he needs.  Parchment off to the side as the recipient for the information, scrap of parchment in one hand and another hand free.  “There is no guarantee that this will work, by the way.  But...just maybe…”</p>
<p>A deep breath in, and he begins to cast the spell.  </p>
<p>He murmurs the arcane words he had been reading just a few moments ago and begins to trace hard lines in the air with his free hand, one following the shape of an eye before shifting into other symbols.  With the other he places the scrap of parchment gently against a section of the blood.</p>
<p>It takes a minute of careful muttering and tracing before the spell completes, the scrap with blood on it evaporating to the magic that consumes it.</p>
<p>He can feel his magic try to connect to something, only for it to slide off and fade.</p>
<p>The parchment remains blank.</p>
<p>The silence in the room is deafening to him.  His heart thuds loudly in his chest.  “That...that didn’t feel right.”</p>
<p>He looks up and over to Greg - the only other one in the room familiar with the arcane - who is also frowning slightly.  “I cast it right, I know I did.  It felt like...it slid off of something?”</p>
<p>Eventually, Greg shakes his head with an apologetic shrug.  “You are right, you cast it just fine.  It is possible that whoever this was simply resisted the magic.”</p>
<p>Amenidal frowns and looks back down.  “But it didn’t feel like resistance…”</p>
<p>His leg bounces as he chews on the inside of his cheek in thought, eyes darting around to his spellbook and then to the blood and back.  It honestly had not felt like someone actively resisting the spell.  He had experienced that before and it had felt different; more of a snap and less of a slide.  </p>
<p>A more acute denial of information.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t resistance...it had to be something else.  Like a barrier…” he mutters stubbornly to himself, feeling the eyes of everyone weighing on him.</p>
<p>Feeling the weight of Kolya laying in the medical room.</p>
<p>Trischal sighs, “You gave it a try squeak, that’s all anyone could ask for.”  She turns back to Shyrendora, much calmer now thankfully, “I could try to track the spy with Fuzzy but they have a good head start and I...am not terribly fond of the idea of leaving right now.”</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, no, no!</p>
<p>He was finally able to do something to help for once.  To be useful.  This fucking barrier wasn’t going to stop him from figuing out who this spy was.  All walls had cracks in them, you just have to know where to look for them.</p>
<p>Amenidal violently begins to root around in his component pouch again, ripping out another scrap of parchment for the spell.  “No!  It was a barrier or some other defensive magic.  There has to be a crack somewhere.  I know it.”</p>
<p>“Amenidal-” of course it’s Trischal who speaks placatingly, but he ignores her.</p>
<p>He imagines his magic as a tight ball of string in his chest, like his mother used to tell him - “It’s there if you ever have need of it, you just have to pull and cut.”  He reaches for the loose end; grasps it tightly before yanking it harshly out of it’s tight ball, not bothering to cut.</p>
<p>The burst of extra arcane energy surges through his limbs and he throws himself into casting again.</p>
<p>No longer muttering, he speaks the incantation with pointed purpose.  His gestures are smooth and sharp with his determination as they retrace the same symbols from earlier.</p>
<p>This barrier will not keep him out.</p>
<p>The spell completes for the second time with a minor flash of red energy, Amenidal’s hands shaking as he feels it connect to the ward.  He feels the crack, feels the magic slip through and connect in the way it should have the first time.</p>
<p>There is no resistance and he nearly hollers in glee.  “Ahaha!  I fucking got you!”</p>
<p>Shyrendora moves closer and peers over him curiously to the script slowly writing itself onto the paper he had dictated as the recipient of the spell’s information.</p>
<p id="AmenidalLetter">Who are you?<br/>I am Titus Skoda</p>
<p id="AmenidalLetter">What are you?<br/>I am a male wolf elf spy</p>
<p id="AmenidalLetter">How was your blood spilled?<br/>I was stabbed by Shyrendora, leader of the dark elves</p>
<p id="AmenidalLetter">When was your blood spilled?<br/>Approximately two hours ago</p>
<p>She sharply breathes out and he catches some of her muttered words, “He called her the Heir...he could smell me...my dagger didn’t cut his clothes...it was a disguise…”  He feels too dizzy to try and figure out what her mutterings are about, but tries to file it away for later questioning.</p>
<p>His brain scatters when she reaches out and gives him a soft pat on the back.  “You did good, Amenidal.”</p>
<p>Amenidal looks down at the information, a tinge of pink starting at the tips of his ears and slowly crawling downwards.  He had helped.  He looks back up with a wide, bright smile.  “At least we know it wasn’t a fire elf now!”</p>
<p>There is another pause of silence in the room for a solid minute before Trischal breaks it with, “Which is wonderful news, but what the hell is a wolf elf?”</p>
<p>That was a really damn good question.</p>
<p>No one seems to have a good answer for it either.</p>
