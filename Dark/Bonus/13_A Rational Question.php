<h1>A Rational Question</h1>

<p><i>[Some short while after the Potluck, in some corner of Surt - Greg has Opinions at Ink]</i></p>
<p>“You should probably pay more heed to your sister’s worry.  She isn’t wrong, and I know you are also aware of it.  However, I know absolutely nothing about your people and am more than content to leave it at that, which sounds like it is the way it needs to be.  Take what I say with a cultural grain of salt, but I feel an uncharacteristic driving need to say something when all I see when I look at you right now is someone else just as hell bent on helping others with that big bleeding heart of theirs.  Maybe it will help you in the end, maybe it won’t.  Maybe you are already aware of every word I am about to say, but I’m going to say it anyway.  </p>
<p>If you are set to walk the path you are on?  Be prepared.  Be prepared for the consequences, hurt, and probably guilt that will follow if things turn sour.  Make sure you surround yourself with people who are willing to support you as you walk forward through the tough shit, but also make sure they are the ones willing to call you out on your bullshit if you go too far.  It’s a balancing act.</p>
<p>Also, be willing to ask for help when and if you need it.  Helping others is well and good until you drown yourself in the accumulated woes and suddenly find yourself hiding under a desk with alcohol to keep you company.  I don’t know if there will ever be anything that we can help you or your people with, but it is out there if you ever need to take it.”</p>
<p><i>[Some two weeks after the Potluck, Greg receives a Sending spell from Ink]</i></p>
<p><i>Greg<br/>
I would talk about what you said<br/>
Without Shyrendora <br/>
Bring Amenidal</i></p>
<p>The lake is quite beautiful at night, the sky reflecting off of it’s surface like the entrance to another world.  The desolate fishing outpost one could think of almost like bones protruding from the ground, waiting for someone to come and make use of them again one day.</p>
<p>Rasputin is currently muttering about future possibilities from where he is sitting against the ground.  Greg, looking like the world's most wrung out towel, is currently sitting next to the lanky elderelf and leaning heavily against him.  His eyes are closed and one might actually believe that he was asleep if not for the very rapid twitches of his ears.</p>
<p>“Amenidal, I swear if you fall in that lake I am not fishing you out.”</p>
<p>The elf in question jerks guiltily away from the edge of the lake, “Sorry!  I just wanted to look at the fish, you know … since you just kinda told me to follow you and Uncle Raspy out here without much explanation?”</p>
<p>Greg’s eyes remain shut.  “I didn’t need you more antsy than you already are.  You’ll see.”</p>
<p>Amenidal huffs but takes to looking around the outpost as Rasputin continues to mutter to himself. </p>
<p>"Hello," states Ink, as he casually stands beside Greg and Rasputin as if he had always been there. He gives Rasputin a sideways squint, but doesn't comment on his presence.</p>
<p>Amenidal whirls around, surprise evident on his face.  He stares for a good long moment, eyes flicking between Ink and Greg.  “I - wait, what?”  He points an accusatory finger at Greg.  “What?”</p>
<p>Greg ignores Amenidal and instead waves half-heartedly at Ink.  “Greetings.  Feel free to sit.  I’m not standing unless it is necessary.”</p>
<p>A blinding grin is all that Rasputin offers to the newcomer.</p>
<p>Ink pauses, but then quietly sits down across from Greg and Rasputin. He briefly turns and inclines his head slightly to Amendial. He then places his hands in his lap and stares at the ground in front of him. After about a minute, he raises his head.</p>
<p>"What happened to you?" He asks the group, "The dark elves."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Amenidal looks mildly baffled, but a dawning realization seems to finally fall over him.  Slowly, he inches over and takes a quiet seat next to Ink, his attention still shifting between Greg and the Cryptid.</p>
<p>Greg opens one eye and gives Ink a measured look.  “That’s a long story with many different perspectives, friend.”  He sighs and shifts so that he is leaning more heavily against Rasputin.  “How about I counter that with, what do you already know about what has happened to us?  We can fill in the blanks from there.”</p>
<p>"Basics," Ink replies, "You decided to help other elves. Shyrendora in the lead. Suffered for it. I wanted to know your perspectives." He glances at the group.</p>
<p>A hand comes up and rests itself on Greg’s shoulder.  He grumbles but does not shove Rasputin’s hand away and focuses back on Ink, both eyes now open.  “Then perspectives we shall give.  I am not a people person, I would rather spend weeks working in isolation than exist in a group of other living echos.”  There is a chuckle from Rasputin at that but Greg forges on, “I was, initially, not pleased with Shyrendora’s actions.  They created too many unknown variables.  The only saving grace was that she was clearly trying to the best of her ability to make sure that it didn’t affect the citizens’ everyday life.  Obviously, she didn’t succeed but the honest effort and attempt was there.”</p>
<p>The hand on his shoulder squeezes, he continues, “Our old Domawit was very proud of his ideals of isolationism.  So proud, he was willing to collapse a tunnel and kill innocent lives to make a point against Shyrendora.  ‘Loss of a few for the safety of the whole’ kind of mindset.  I decided I liked that even less than what Shyrendora was doing.”  He shrugs a shoulder, “In the end, I only lost a Home.  Others lost more,” he gestures to Amenidal at that, “but we are alive and stubborn.”</p>
<p>Amenidal is staring at Greg with wide eyes, obviously not aware of certain details that were just said.</p>
<p>Ink quietly absorbs everything Greg says. He neither moves nor comments. His face shows no expression as he listens. When Greg finishes, he taps a finger against his knee a few times, lost in thought.</p>
<p>"I have a dilemma for you," Ink finally speaks, "A… puzzle. Logic game. You are in a dark room, chained to a desk. Before you, an open book. Above you, a guillotine blade. Upon the page of the book, a life. Their story. Hopes, dreams, fears, desires, good, evil, all. Also, their impending cruel death. If you touch the page, they are spared that death but there is a one in one thousand chance that the guillotine will fall upon your head. If you do not touch the page, that person dies but you live. Either way, the page will turn to show a new life and a new death."</p>
<p>He pauses, "What would you do?"</p>
<p>Greg’s face is carefully blank as he raises his head from where it leans against Rasputin.  His words are slow, indicating the thought he is giving this question, “Logically, I can’t touch every page.  Everything lives and dies at some point.  If I touch the page to spare them one death, there will always be another for them waiting down the line.  I would pick and choose my battles, so to speak.  Sometimes knowing that you can help doesn’t mean that you should.”</p>
<p>The rather silent elder at his side snorts but has a placid smile on his face, “Always so logical, Gniewko.  As for this old bone, I have lived good life.  Long life.  Am content to make it easier for others if given opportunity to do so.”  He pauses and scratches at his chin nonchalantly, “Given that is only self at desk.  More than self at desk gives more implied complications.”</p>
<p>Amenidal has also been uncharacteristically silent, his head bent to look at the ground as his knee bounces.  “<small>Is there no way to break the chain?</small>” is the soft whisper that comes from his direction.</p>
<p>Once again, Ink silently listens to the offered answers. His eyes are unfocused, staring at a point between them all. When Amenidal's whisper falls quiet, he still does not move.</p>
<p>It is a solid ten minutes before Ink raises his head to speak to Greg.</p>
<p>"You are correct. The book has unlimited pages. You would try to do the most good possible with the time you have. That is… honorable. Statistically, meaningless. Whether you touch one page in ten, one in a thousand, one in a million, you will still save approximately the same number before the end. And what do you become, silently judging who lives and dies?"</p>
<p>He pauses before continuing, "Only two options. Save lives, or do nothing. Rationally, only way to survive is to do nothing. Then what? Sit in the dark, passively watching people you could save die? Turn away, close your eyes, embrace eternal dark? What would you be?"</p>
<p>He stops and turns his head to Rasputin, "You gave the answer of a kind heart, but raise a good point. It is an allegory, for… our situation. At my desk, it is far more than me in chains. It is all the Cryptids. I play this game with all their lives. With what they will become."</p>
<p>Ink lowers his head, "And those are the only options. Play the game until I inevitably bring death to all my people, or do nothing and allow them to sit in the dark until we are nothing but twisted dispassionate monsters. It is… an impossible choice."</p>
<p>He turns his head towards Amenidal, "So I need… help. I cannot resolve this. Not alone. I need a way to break my chains, to find another solution. Please… help me find a way."</p>
<p>The trio of dark elves are quiet in the wake of Ink’s revelations.</p>
<p>Greg closes his eyes, but his brow is furrowed as his finger taps against his thigh.  “Well…” he mutters almost to himself, “<small>I did say ask for help.  Not quite what I was picturing when I said that.</small>”</p>
<p>It takes a few moments, but Amenidal lifts his head to look at Ink directly.  His eyes are bright with determination and an undercurrent of some kind of emotion.  “We obviously can’t know the specifics or nature of your chain.  That is another secret that puts all of you in more danger, right?”  His knee is bouncing once more.  “Have you… ever tried before?  Has anyone tried before?”</p>
<p>Ink turns slowly to Amenidal. The still expression on his face slowly melts into one of profound sadness.</p>
<p>"I once attempted to break a similar chain," his voice is a dry echo, "and in doing so, I forged this one."</p>
<p>The knee stops bouncing, Amenidal’s eyes going round as he stares in stunned silence.</p>
<p>His posture straightens for a second, if only so he can lean over, his forehead resting gently on Ink’s arm in a similar manner to what he did at the potluck.  Instead of pulling away like he did before, however, he leaves his head there as he speaks, “<span class="tooltip">Moje srdce ti bolí…<span class="tooltiptext">My heart aches for you</span></span>  you found a third option and it both worked and didn’t work.  Now we look for a fourth.”</p>
<p>Ink lowers his head to look at Amenidal. The sadness on his face lessens, but remains. He speaks quietly.</p>
<p>"<span class="tooltip">Ako moje srdce stále bije, mám nádej.<span class="tooltiptext">As my heart is still beating, I have hope.</span></span>”</p>
<p>Greg is now rubbing his forehead but cracks his eyes open to give the two of them a curious look, his gaze lingering on Amenidal before it shifts to Ink.  “How much can you say, even in the form of an allegory or puzzle, without rolling your proverbial dice?” </p>
<p>"Mmm," Ink hums, "That <i>is</i> the question. I spoke of secrets, one secret that if discovered,  will be our end. But what leads to that? Is everything I do a touch of that page?"</p>
<p>He closes his eyes and lowers his head, lost in thought. Once again he does not move for some time. When he raises his head, he looks to Greg.</p>
<p>"I gazed into the abyss," his voice is cold, "and now it gazes upon us. Like the secret, it will never go away. Like the secret, if we give ourselves to the abyss, we will never return. We… we must be alive. We must be elves."</p>
<p>He glances at Amenidal, "<span class="tooltip">Ak naše srdce stále bije, sme elfovia. ak sa zastavia, sme príšery.<span class="tooltiptext">If our hearts still beat, we are elves.  If they stop, we are monsters.</span></span>"</p>
<p>He looks at the group, "I must keep us in the world, but never reveal us to it. An impossible balance. "</p>
<p>As Ink finishes, Rasputin leans forward, resting his arms upon his legs.  His sharp face is fairly unreadable but it seems like he is focusing his attention on Ink and Ink alone.  He says nothing, though, as Greg makes a low sounding groan from next to him.</p>
<p>“Right… well.  I will need some time to… process,” he gives Ink a rather sincere look, “but I am willing to give what I can to help you in this.  I would also like for your people to remain as elves.”  It’s clear he doesn’t quite follow what that means but the sincerity is there at least.</p>
<p>Amenidal finally lifts his head from Ink’s arm.  His eyes, once bright, are now ablaze as he holds out both of his hands and shifts so that he is facing Ink more directly.  “May I see your hand?”</p>
<p>Ink turns his head to give Amenidal a curious look. He says nothing, but slowly moves his hand until it rests in Amenidal's, palm up.</p>
<p>Very slowly, Amenidal shifts one hand and places it palm down over Ink’s.  He breathes in and then meets the Cryptid’s eyes, his voice soft, “<span class="tooltip">Keď moje srdce bije svojimi nádejami a snami, chcem vám pomôcť nájsť cestu.<span class="tooltiptext">As my heart beats with my hopes and dreams, I want to help you find a way.</span></span>” </p>
<p>Ink meets Amendal's eyes with an inscrutable expression. He goes through several facial motions, as if he is about to say something. He stops and gives Amenidal another strange look.</p>
<p>Amendial feels something moving on Ink's hand - no, not on Ink's hand, <i>in</i> Ink's hand. He can actually feel tattoos moving under Ink's skin, and somehow feel a twinge of magical energy. Even though Ink isn't moving or speaking at all, Amendial realizes that Ink is somehow casting a spell.</p>
<p>"Thank -" Ink begins to speak.</p>
<p>Before he can say another word, images flash in Amenidal's head. They are tattoos. Intricate, astonishingly complicated tattoos. Not just the complete images, however. He can see how they are created, the slow deliberate process of placing then on skin, the careful process of selecting dye and components, the ritualistic fashion with which it is performed, and the breathtakingly beautiful process with which art is paired with a startlingly complicated three dimensional matrix of arcane energy. Ink is showing him what the process of creating a magic tattoo looks like.</p>
<p><i>When-If my guillotine falls </i>Amenidal less hears the voice than he is simply aware of Ink's crystal clear words <i>I do not want my art to be lost. I will teach you more, if you wish.</i></p>
<p>"- you." Ink finishes.</p>
<p>Amenidal realizes that less than a second has passed. Ink has not even changed facial expressions.</p>
<p>With slightly shaking hands, he presses the top one more firmly against Ink’s.  Amenidal gives only the slightest nod of his head in response. </p>
<p>Fin.</p>
