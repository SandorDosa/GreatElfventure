<h1>A Stupid, Awkward Dream</h1>

<p>Amenidal lounges on his bed, arms crossed under his chin as he tiredly looks over some of the notes spread out before him.  He had been looking at them all night, trying to memorize the information hidden in those ink swirls.  What he could not memorize he was still trying to decode.</p>
<p>With the late (early) hour though, his brain is a little slow on the informational uptake.</p>
<p>He let's his eyes fall shut with a groan, the burning feeling letting him know that he really should stop now.  Greg's notes were fun to practice decoding on, but they always took a while as there was at least one language in there that he was unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>His mind wanders to a different decoding, one that involves pale skin and swirling, intricate tattoos.  His mind likes to wander to this place if he doesn't keep a tight rein on his thoughts.  He feels the exhaustion eating at the corners of his brain and doesn't fight it this time around.  There really is no current harm in wondering.</p>
<p>It is easy to put a dark elves' interpretation on those beautiful lines, but he wanders away from that.  Some of those lines and shapes would make no sense whatsoever if they were translated as dark elf tattoos.</p>
<p>No, those tattoos were more than that.</p>
<p>They had something to do with Ink's magic.  </p>
<p>Amenidal would be respectful of what Ink said and not press the burning questions that he had, but surely just private pondering wouldn't be a breach of that.</p>
<p>His first theory is that the tattoo on Ink's chest is his focus for casting.</p>
<p>With now having spoken to the cryptid not but maybe a month after the potluck where that theory began, he has a second theory.</p>
<p>Theory two is that Ink's tattoos are, at the core of it, his spellbook.  He knows he wasn't paying the best attention when talking to Ink in the room he borrowed, but he does not recall ever seeing him with a spellbook of any kind.  It was just tattoos shifting over skin.</p>
<p>It makes enough sense to him, especially with Ink saying that they did in fact have meaning; meaning that he did not wish to elaborate on.  It was something he was going to continue to be respectful about.  Model of restraint, in fact, over his curiosity.</p>
<p>There is an itch in his fingers, reminding him of how badly he had wanted to trace the lines presented willingly to him on Ink’s arm.  Gorgeous, finely crafted tattoos that would make even the most skilled chronicler drool in envy.</p>
<p>Amenidal should really stop thinking about how pretty those tattoos are.  He really, really should stop.  His brain doesn't want to, though.</p>
<p>He sighs and shifts his head so that his cheek is now resting on his forearms.  He lets his mind wander more, recalling the cool touch of fingers upon the forearm he was currently laying on.</p>
<p>It didn’t mean anything.  Not a single thing, as Trischal loves to continually point out to him when she notices him daydreaming.</p>
<p>Amenidal is aware of his youth in this situation, but he isn’t that naive.  He knows very well that it didn’t mean anything and has taken many steps to ensure that he keeps himself on professionally polite terms with the cryptid who was willing to show him a part of his tattooing art.</p>
<p>He catches himself wishing every so often that it meant something anyway.</p>
<p>A grumble escapes him as he sharply moves his head again so that his face is completely buried by his crossed arms.</p>
<p>He needs to stop this line of thought, seriously.  It will just make it worse and he knows this.</p>
<p>Time passes as he lays there and mentally argues with himself over pointless things.  </p>
<p>A soft creak from his bed makes him frown into his arms, ears flicking up curiously.  He hears nothing outside of his own breathing and the sounds of normal movement outside his room.</p>
<p>Odd.</p>
<p>Something cool brushes across his back.  “Hello.”</p>
<p>Amenidal’s eyes snap open and he goes to jerk his head up and look towards the source of the sudden voice.  His head … does not obey his wishes though his eyes remain wide and very aware while his heart races in his chest in a way that has his ears vibrating with the pulse.</p>
<p>“Don’t.”</p>
<p>The cool brush against his back solidifies into distinct fingers.  They remain stationary for the moment and he has to swallow thickly around the sudden lump in his throat.  "I-Ink?" is what he attempts to say, but no sound leaves his mouth.</p>
<p>Did he … did he cast hold person on him?</p>
<p>The fingers shift and he is absolutely certain now that there is a weight on his bed besides himself.  "Hm.  I am welcome, no?"</p>
<p>His heart is doing exciting things in his chest as he tries to get his brain to function with the current situation.  He tries to move his fingers at least and finds that it is not just his head that is disobeying orders to move.</p>
<p>So hold person was the most likely answer.</p>
<p>The rush of that realization should be a rush of concern, or even fear - you know, healthy things that would probably keep someone alive in a dangerous situation.  Instead, the rush does nothing but shift blood much further south from his brain than he would like it to be.  The small points of contact between his back and Ink’s fingers suddenly feel electrically charged.</p>
<p>That is something he definitely wasn’t aware of about himself until just now.</p>
<p>Ok then.</p>
<p>Amenidal takes in a sharp breath and tries to let it out evenly as the cool fingers shift up his back to his shoulders and then begin to follow a pattern.  His breathing turns shaky at the realization that Ink is tracing the back tattoo that he didn’t show him.</p>
<p>“You let me see your tattoos.  They show much of who you are.”</p>
<p>A finger traces a line along the back of his ribs and he feels the goosebumps that break out in the wake of the touch.  His breathing stutters and he is fairly certain his heart is either going to explode or just stop beating altogether.</p>
<p>“I would like to know you.” rasps somewhere above him and his stomach does a sharp twist.</p>
<p>The finger shifts along a curve that reaches to the center of his spine.  It, along with a few other fingers, slowly trail down his vertebrae until they reach the small of his back and change course to follow the part of the lines that go close to his hip.</p>
<p>He swallows again and wishes that he could say something, but at the same time, maybe it was better that he couldn’t?  He was well aware of his tendencies to ramble, and this was certainly a situation that would have him rambling like a wildfire.</p>
<p>Why Ink is suddenly here doesn’t seem to be a thing that his brain wants to focus on in the moment.  </p>
<p>It is a very important question, he acknowledges that much.  His fried brain and other things, however, are more than content to roll with these seemingly random happenings.  He did in fact say that Ink was welcome to visit, and the cryptid was not known for loud announcements of his presence.</p>
<p>The fingers continue to trail across his back until he mentally lulls with the repetitive movements.  Every time Ink seems to follow a pattern, his stomach does a sharp little jump and his chest feels far too tight.</p>
<p>It’s not … uncomfortable.  A little bizarre, but not uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He’s had crushes before when he was younger, he knows what a crush feels like.  It does surprise him, though, how badly he is apparently craving some kind of personal connection like this.  He has plenty of personal connections - Trischal, Greg, even Uncle Raspy - just not … one like this.  None of them had ever traced his tattoos like this, not even Trischal at her most sisterly.</p>
<p>His parents had, once upon a time.</p>
<p>“You are lost.”</p>
<p>Amenidal’s brain jerks violently back to the physical realm when a hand splays out over the center of his back in time with the raspy monotone.  His face heats more and he wonders idly if it is possible to melt through solid objects because of blushing.</p>
<p>Silence passes between them and he again attempts to turn his head to try and look at the cryptid.  His neck still refuses to respond and he tries to remember how long the spell? is meant to last.  He thinks it lasts for as long as the particular caster can keep it up and varies on the skill of the caster.</p>
<p>Weight presses onto his back and a sharp breath leaves him as the twist in his stomach turns electric and goes down.  There is something tickling the back of his neck (hair?) and he can feel a presence leaning closer in to him.</p>
<p>Ink’s voice is much closer as his fingers trace some kind of a circular pattern while the heel of his hand continues to put significant weight on Amenidal’s back.  “This one is mine.  You made it.”</p>
<p>If he could tremble at this moment he is damn sure he would be vibrating out of his skin.  It takes him a second, but he eventually recognizes the circular pattern as the tutelage mark he was in the process of making for Ink.</p>
<p>How did he … ?</p>
<p>Amenidal’s mind fumbles around for some kind of coherent thought; his breathing increasing significantly until it sounds like he is gasping.</p>
<p>Ink knows about the mark.  Ink knows that it is <i>his</i> mark.</p>
<p>Something fuzzy in the back of his mind wiggles insistently about the fact that the mark hasn’t even been created in full yet.  There is nothing on his back for Ink to trace, logically; and yet his heart still gallops in his chest wildly.</p>
<p>The weight on his back eases.  He can’t help the embarrassing whine that leaves him at the decreasing pressure.  Ink’s hand is still cool as ever but it feels like it’s burning an imprint into his skin.</p>
<p>That raspy voice is much closer now, “I can show you other things.”  The hand slides to his side and, by every Echo witnessing his shame, his insides quake at the same time that his breathing stops.  He feels like a tensed coil, bound to snap at the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>He feels a brush against his ear.  “<i>Would you like to learn?</i>”</p>
<p>The coil snaps.</p>
<p>Physics becomes questionable until a sharp pain against the back of his head snaps his awareness into full gear.</p>
<p>Amenidal lays in confusion on the floor of his room, definitely not in the position that he had just been in, with papers scattered about like a storm had blown through.</p>
<p>He blinks.</p>
<p>He blinks again.</p>
<p>What the fuck had just happened?</p>
<p>Slowly, he pushes himself into an upright position and hisses as his head throbs.  He reaches up a hand to gingerly rub at the back of his head when he becomes aware of another kind of throbbing.</p>
<p>Amenidal stares at his lap.</p>
<p>The realization dawns on him, making the tips of his ears all the way down to his shoulders turn beet red.</p>
<p>Oh. <i> Well then.</i></p>
<p>The high hopes he had for his brain not making things weird goes up in smoke.  Weird, weird lucid dream smoke.</p>
<p>Dignity blown to the winds at this point, Amenidal does the only thing that makes sense to him in the moment.  He grabs the pillow that had fallen to the side of his bed with him, plants his face firmly into it, and screams out his frustrated shame.</p>
