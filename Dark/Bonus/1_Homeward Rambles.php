<p><b>Homeward Rambles</b></p>

<p>“Amenidal.”</p>
<p>The boy pauses from his methodical de-legging of a decent bug he had found for a snack.  It is close to the beginning hours of night, the sun blissfully disappearing on the horizon and offering freedom from the darkened googles it forces them to wear.  The river sounds loudly to the side, their ever faithful reminder of the direction home.  Travel above land was tiring and he would not miss it in any way if they could get their tunnel system as sprawling as it was before the war.</p>
<p>His ears twitch before he turns his head to look at the shrouded form of Shyrendora.  She is slumped in a sitting pose to match her tired tone, above ground travel also getting to her.  It doesn’t fool him for a moment though - her eyes are sharp and there is a steel under the tired.</p>
<p>Times like this remind him with dizzying clarity that she is indeed Scoutmaster Shyrendora <span class="tooltip">Nadezhda<span class="tooltiptext">Hope</span></span>, hero who held back encroaching teeth and claws so that others could flee to safety.  She who defied the <span class="tooltip">Domawit<span class="tooltiptext">Dom - house, wit - to rule, to lead</span></span> for the sake of strangers above.</p>
<p>Her head tilts to the side, “I have a matter I need to discuss with you before we reach Home again.”</p>
<p>Amenidal turns fully to her out of respect and interest, bug set to the side for the time being.  “Um...alright.  Is this about the potluck?”</p>
<p>Her smile is small and doesn’t reach her eyes.  “In a manner, yes.”  She goes silent and stares at him for a while longer, almost as if assessing him and weighing what she sees.  “Tell me, do you know why I agreed with Trischal to let you come with me?”</p>
<p>The question throws him and he can’t help but frown some in thought.  The silence stretches as he obviously comes up with no good guesses for her question.  “I...I don’t know, actually.  Why did you let me come along?  I’m not a high ranking Scout or Sapper.  The only thing I’ve really done was get caught trying to get into Asavardi.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora shifts so she is no longer sitting with a slump, her hands resting softly on her knees as she crosses her legs in front of her.  “Because I see potential.”  She holds up a hand when he opens his mouth to comment.  “Not as a Scout or a Sapper, but as an Envoy.  You managed to travel safely to and from Asavardi, and from what I saw at the potluck, left a good impression upon their leaders.”</p>
<p>All of the childish things he did at the potluck creep up his neck in the form of a bright blush.  “O-oh…”</p>
<p>She continues on, either willfully or actually ignorant of his sudden embarrassment.  “You have the potential to foster friendly relations with those you meet.  I need someone like that among the people as we move forward.  I do not trust Uncle to leave a good impression, even as charismatic as he can be, or to not cross bounds he ought not with the surface elves.”</p>
<p>Amenidal scratches shyly at the back of his neck.  “Uncle Raspy isn’t that bad...once you get to know him.”</p>
<p>The stare he receives in turn makes him shrink down into his shoulders slightly.</p>
<p>“I too am fond of Uncle, but it would be a lie to say that he translates well in new groups of peers.”  Her voice is soft in comparison to her stare.  “As it stands, I also do not trust Uncle to go alone to other cities...I never have, to be honest.  Thusly, I cannot constantly send Greg to watch over him when he has other duties that the people require of him.”  She pauses for a moment before muttering, “I also do not trust Greg to care enough to leave a good impression on surfacers.”</p>
<p>He feels very dizzy at this point.  When did the night become hot?  It’s cold as hell out.  It’s winter up here for Echo’s sake!</p>
<p>“But,” he’s squeaking now and it’s really hard to talk past the lump in his throat, “I’m just...I have no idea how -!”</p>
<p>Mercifully, Shyrendora cuts him off.  “This will not be immediate, Amenidal.  I would not throw you to lava without a badger to guide you.  I believe you can learn some from Uncle, as long as you take most of what he says with a spider’s thread.”  Her head tilts again as she continues, “You are an intelligent youth.  Do not think I haven’t heard you muttering about tattoos and magic theories since we left the potluck.”</p>
<p>The mention of that does not help Amenidal’s squeaking issue.  “Well!  I mean...I don’t really know what happened at the potluck, uh, with - um - <small>oh Echos I don’t even know what honorific to give him </small>- the poofing, I was just making wild guesses based on stories that I have heard from Uncle Raspy about magic and it just kinda <small>looked really cool withthetattoomovingandall...what does this have to do with me being intelligent I don’t understand.</small>”</p>
<p>Shyrendora’s serious look breaks into amusement at the flustered response.  Ah to be youthful and not jaded by the ones you were so keen on looking up to.  A slight flustering was only fair though; the boy had been non-stop in his not-so-subtle way of asking when the mysterious, magic wielding cryptid was going to visit the Hilt’Inn, and they had only just left the fort.</p>
