<h1>I Said Never Again</h1>

<p id="i">The tunnels are thick with an air of urgency.  Their scouting party had been chosen to pass along some information to a camp close to enemy lines.  While they had been successful, Trischal couldn’t shake the feeling of a slowly creeping unease going up her spine.  She had to make sure that they did their routine double back and slip into a different tunnel system instead of just barging the fastest way forwards towards Home.</p>
<p id="i">They were paused at a juncture, taking a moment to scout ahead before continuing onto another double back.</p>
<p id="i">Trischal looks over her small team of four, her hand absently petting the top of Fuzzy’s head.  She had thought about leaving her companion back Home but had decided that he would be too useful with their double-backs to leave behind; especially should they decided to make changes to the tunnels.  Ivan is off to the side, her hand upon the stone wall as her ears shift ever so slightly.</p>
<p id="i">Seb’s attention is rapt upon his partner’s ears and Trischal wonders if they have their own code outside of Tunnel Speak.  It’s probably that he is looking into her ear movements with interpretive concern - they are all on edge.  Everything felt too still.  Too calm.</p>
<p id="i">An ear flicks down with whatever findings she made, “I hear something burrowing but it ceased and hasn’t picked up again.”</p>
<p id="i">She responds with a series of rapid twitches , “Move forward with caution.  We are likely being followed.”</p>
<p id="i">Flickers of agreement go through their small group as they begin to gather themselves to continue onward.</p>
<p id="i">A soul shattering crack echos in the darkness.</p>
<p id="i">It is the only warning they get.</p>
<p id="i">Fear pulses through her veins as they all break into a run, but it is not fast enough to escape the onslaught of stone from above.  Something smashes into the left side of her face hard enough to make her collapse to the side; her world spinning and darkening as dulled voices yell with the stone around her.</p>
<p id="i">It all fades to nothingness.</p>
<p>Awareness descends upon Trischal with a jerk and a sharp gasp, her body informing her of it’s unhappiness at events past.  She forces her aching eyes to open and is greeted by blissful darkness of what looks to be the ceiling in one of the medical caves.</p>
<p>Past and present war for dominance in her mind, until a shudder reminds her of a bone chilling cold that still sits upon her limbs.</p>
<p>Right.  There was a storm.</p>
<p>Trischal is fairly certain that her mind was on autopilot through most of the blizzard, as her memory of it is hazy at best.  When she tries to think back on it, all she can hear is a faint mantra of “get them home, get them home, get them home” with the image of Fuzzy plowing his way through snow.  Something in the back of her mind informs her that she had lashed some of her Pathfinders to Fuzzy, as they were too weak from the cold to move on their own or unconscious.</p>
<p>She doesn’t really recall doing that, but it sounds to character of what she would do.</p>
<p>She had no clue if everyone was alive or not.  So many hands had whisked everyone away when she had come stumbling back to the Hilt’Inn, Shyrendora and Vahn at the front of a sea of faces.  She is pretty sure she passed out at that point.</p>
<p>There is a snort to her side, and she lets her head roll slightly to get a better look at who is in the cave with her.</p>
<p>The cot that she is occupying is not far off the ground, keeping her close to the warmth the stones offered.  Fuzzy looms at her side - her ever watchful guardian.  Much to her amusement, Amenidal rests against Fuzzy’s side; his face lax as he sleeps unknowingly against the disgruntled badger.</p>
<p>“Hey there buddy.” She murmurs with a scratchy voice and reaches up a clumsy, bandaged hand to ruffle Fuzzy’s fur.  She still can’t feel anything.  “I owe you big again.”</p>
<p>She gets a snort in response and a slight nudge from the head she is attempting to pet.  The nudging makes her hand fall back to her side where he lays a paw, his little black eyes watching her keenly.  It, at the very least, gets a weak laugh out of her.  “Alright, alright … I get the point.”</p>
<p>“Glad to see you are awake, priateľ.”  A familiar voice whispers off to her other side.</p>
<p>Trischal turns her head and meets Shyrendora’s weary gaze.  She is sitting upon one of the lower stools next to the cot, arms resting on her knees as she remains leaned forward.  Her heart hammers in her chest and the question is flying from her before she can think about it, “Are they alive?”</p>
<p>The other woman takes a deep breath in and seems to hold it for a moment.  When she breathes out it is in words, “Yes.  Some are lacking digits now and are in very rough shape, but they are alive.”</p>
<p>She misses the expression on Shyrendora’s face as she lets her eyes shut in relief.  The feeling floods her very core and she can feel the tension that had been building slowly release.  Shyrendora wouldn’t lie to her about news like that; she wouldn’t be able to lie about that in fact.  The woman was notoriously bad at keeping anything from her - good or bad.</p>
<p>They were home.  They were alive.</p>
<p>The past did not repeat itself.</p>
<p>“Trish.”</p>
<p>She opens her eyes again and catches the edge of something in Shyrendora’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Why did you go so far out?  You weren’t supposed to go to the river mouth.”  She sounds so calm as she speaks, but Trischal knows how Shyrendora works.  Her mind is racing behind her eyes; screaming, shouting and probably cursing.</p>
<p>Looking back at her decision, she does feel … a tad bit foolish, but she did not want to come back empty handed while everyone was working so hard to solve their encroaching food shortage.  Letting her people starve was just as bad as sending them out into an open battle, only their death would be slower with starvation.  She had made an oath and by every Echo ever sung in a cave - she was not going to break it so soon into them finding a new Home.  “I couldn’t return with nothing but news of skeletal fish.  I had to do something, and now we know that there is a growing population of fish back towards the river.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora’s mask breaks some and her hands come up to rub her face.  “You … just lectured me about taking risks with my well-being.  And yet here you are, in the medical caves because you decided to go venturing outside in Winter.”</p>
<p>Trischal gets slightly defensive at that.  “You were talking to a known violent werewolf.  By yourself.  I at least had a team with me while I was trying to find a Food Source to help our people with our current refugee situation.”</p>
<p>The hands resting on Shyrendora’s face move and begin to gesture with her words.  “Yes.  We established this last time.  But Trish, you took a stupid risk.  We could have tried again when the weather warmed-”</p>
<p>She snorts softly, “It would have been a bit late by then, priateľ.  We are running tight on time as is, you heard the researchers same as I.”  She glances down at her numb hands, breaking eye contact with Shyrendora.  “If I was going to follow in your path of foolish decisions I would want it to be for the sake of the People.  So that is what I did.”</p>
<p>A deep seated sigh and the clink of metal makes her look back in time to see Shyrendora taking a short drink from her flask.  If she were in any state to do so, she would happily attempt to knock the damn thing out of her hands; or tell Greg to stop making the damn stuff.</p>
<p>When Shyrendora meets her eyes again, there is something guarded there.  “You shouldn’t follow me down that path, Trish.”</p>
<p>Trischal presses her lips into a thin line, anger bubbling gently in her gut.  Stubbornly, she shifts sharply and gets herself into a semi-sitting position with her elbows shakily supporting her.  She ignores both the unhappy snorts from Fuzzy as well as Shyrendora’s movements to get her to lay back down.</p>
<p>She stares her friend hard in the eye until she sees the guards slowly lowering with confusion.  Her voice is hard when she speaks, “I will follow what path I choose.  That is the way of our People.  I made an Oath, priateľ, to keep our People safe.  I will always fight tooth and nail to bring everyone back home.  I will always put myself beside them when I send them into known danger.”  </p>
<p>She feels her arms buckling but holds on for a moment longer, “I will follow you, my Domawit, whether you like it or not.  You have only ever cared for our People, and I will do no less for them than you would.”</p>
<p>Her arms finally give and she flops back onto the cot with angry tears starting to well in her eyes.  “We have lost enough.  Our old home, our people.  I refuse to let it happen again without fighting against it with everything that I am.”</p>
<p>A hand rests gently over her eyes, giving her tears an illusion of privacy while a thumb rests lightly on her scoutmaster mark.  “You have fought, Trish, harder than anyone else I know to make sure that we are safe.”  It sounds like there is something strangled in Shyrendora’s words, “I need you to rest for now.  You and the pathfinders need to recuperate for the season…your information is likely to save us some much needed time.”</p>
<p>There is a lengthy pause where no sound save for their breathing echos in the cavern around them.</p>
<p>“Thank you, priateľ.  You have helped save us again.”  Shyrendora’s voice is raw and she recognizes the tell-tale signs of her fighting back her own tears.</p>
<p>Trischal takes a deep breath to try and ground herself.  She can’t feel most of her hands and feet, her ears are also numb when she flicks them against the pillow beneath her head.  She would do it again.  “I said never again when I took that Oath, and I meant it.”</p>
