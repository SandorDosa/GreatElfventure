    <h1>Creation Myths</h1>
    <h2>Allophrynidae</h2>
    <p>So how we tell it, in them days right after the Shatter when all them elves were still learnin’ how things done changed, Boudreaux and Thibodeaux built themselves a pirogue and went out on the river for a spell.  They spent the day a fishin’ and a drinkin’ and they done lost sight of the way they come.  Both Boudreaux an Thibodeaux got themselves ass-lost.</p>
    <p>Now neither one of them could admit to the other that they was lost, so they just kept followin the river an pretendin they both know where they goin.  When they hit the ocean where Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros is always there, they hit a rock an the boat, she began to sink.</p>
    <p>Now Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros, He don’ really know much about things that float on the water.  But He is our Goddess and He does know water and He knows us.  He saw Boudreaux and Thibodeaux drownin’ an He put a stop to it.</p>
    <p>‘Oh babies!  No, don’t you drown!’ Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros say, wavin His hands and sendin godly powers their way.  So they didn’t drown.</p>
    <p>Mais, they still can’t admit that they is ass-lost.  So they finished their fishin’ an’ built themselves a new pirogue, an loaded it with redfish.  Still not admittin’ that they’re ass-lost, they started back up the river.</p>
    <p>Upriver, they found themselves encounterin’ a city full of hobgoblins.  Still not admittin’ they is ass-lost, Boudreaux and Thibodeaux, they ask to trade the redfish for a map.  The hobgoblins agreed to the trade, an took all them redfish.  But them hobgoblins ain’t elves, and anyone that ain’t an elf ain’t to be trusted.  So they pushed Boudreaux an’ Thibodeaux into the river.</p>
    <p>But Boudreaux and Thibodeaux, they don’t drown.  Instead they float downstream to the coast again.  An they built themselves another pirogue.  This time they loaded it with crabs.  Still not admittin’ that they is ass-lost, they started back on up the river.</p>
    <p>Upriver, they found themselves encounterin’ a city full of dwarves.  Still not admittin’ they is ass-lost, Boudreaux and Thibodeaux they ask to trade the crabs for a map.  The dwarves agreed to the trade, an took all them crabs.  But them dwarves ain’t elves, and anyone that ain’t an elf ain’t to be trusted.  So they pushed Boudreaux an Thobodeaux into the river.</p>
    <p>But Boudreaux and Thibodeaux, they don’t drown.  Instead they float downstream to the coast again.  An they built themselves another pirogue.  This time they loaded it with shramp.  Still not admittin’ that they’re ass-lost they started back on up the river.</p>
    <p>Upriver, they found themselves encouterin’ a city full of humans.  Still not admittin’ they’re ass-lost, Boudreaux and Thobodeaux they ask to trade the shramp for a map.  The humans agreed to the trade, an took all them shramp.  But them humans, they ain’t no elves neither.  And anyone that ain’t an elf ain’t to be trusted.  So they pushed Boudreaux an’ Thibodeaux into the river.</p>
    <p>[continue until someone interrupts]</p>
    <p>Weh non!  Clams!  An’ kobolds.  </p>
    <p>An by then many years they gone by and Boudreaux and Thibodeaux were old.  An they still ain’t admitted that they had done got themselves ass-lost.  They keep goin’ up an down the river, an’ their families they come with.  An tradition is just repeatin’ the same things for generations.  So Boudreaux an Thibodeaux die and their families keep on ridin currents.  An’ that’s how we river elves started on the rivers even when we ain’t ass-lost.</p>

    <p>So how we tell it, in them days right after the Shatter when all them elves were still learnin’ how things done changed, Boudreaux and Thibodeaux built themselves a pirogue and went out on the river for a spell.  They spent the day a fishin’ and a drinkin’ and they done lost sight of the way they come.  Both Boudreaux an Thibodeaux got themselves ass-lost.</p>
    <p>Now, they both know they was ass-lost, so they got to arguin bout it an pass some words between them that they shoulda never said.  An while they arguin’ their pirogue keep on a followin’ the current.  Rivers, by habit, done always flow naturally to the sea where the water is all salty an yall can’t even drink it.</p>
    <p>Boudreaux an Thibodeaux quit their arguin’ and began to fight ‘bout how they gon’ get back up the river to go home now.  Thibodeaux hit Boudreaux wi’ his paddle an Boudreaux broke his cane pole o’er Thibodeaux’s head.  They got to wrestlin’ an fightin’ an’ got even more ass-lost.</p>
    <p>The ocean, she’s always in a mood.  A big big wave done hit their pirogue and knocked out both Boudreaux an Thibodeaux.  But they was fightin’ so hard they don’t even notice.</p>
    <p>Now Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros, She don’ really get Herself involved when Her chillins git quarrelsome.  But She don’t really want none of us to die or nothin.</p>
    <p>‘Oh babies!  No, don’t you drown!’ Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros say, wavin’ Her hands at them fightin elves.  An’ Boudreaux an Thibodeaux, they don’t drown.  But they still fightin when they done sink all the way to the bottom.  </p>
    <p>At the bottom of the ocean  they stop, an they axe Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros t’pick which ‘a them’s the winner.  An She tells em that She loves them both the sames.  Mad as snakes, they done split up an’ git t’thinkin.</p>
    <p>Boudreaux, he done come up with a grand plan.  He swims hisself upriver, swaps some fish fer some shiny gold, an turnt round to come back.  He were gon’ give the shiny gold to Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros t’prove that he were the better elf.</p>
    <p>But Thibodeaux, he were already up to no good, no.  He went down deep, an prettied up his hair.  He made hisself a grand do, lookin’ real fine t’prove that he were the better elf.</p>
    <p>Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros look at Boudreaux an Thibodeaux, an Boudreaux’s shiny gift of gold an’ Thibodeaux’s real fine do.  An She tells em how it is.</p>
    <p>‘Oh babies!  You know I can’t pick a favorite.  I loves you both the same.  Ain’t nothing you got to prove to me.’  An She gives em both hugs an kisses in the warm shallows of the sea.</p>
    <p>But they fight ain’t over.  Non.  Boudreaux, he figures he just ain’t got the right gift yet.  So he heads upriver an he trades some fish fer some shiny silver, an turnt round to come back.  He were gon’ give the shiny silver to Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros t’prove that he were the better elf.</p>
    <p>But Thibodeaux, he were already up to no good, no.  He went down deep, an prettied up his ears.  He made hisself a grand do, lookin’ real fine t’prove that he were the better elf.</p>
    <p>Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros look at Boudreaux an Thibodeaux, an Boudreaux’s shiny gift of silver an’ Thibodeaux’s real fine do.  An She tells em how it is.</p>
    <p>‘Oh babies!  You know I can’t pick a favorite.  I loves you both the same.  Ain’t nothing you got to prove to me.’  An She gives em both hugs an kisses in the warm shallows of the sea.</p>
    <p>[repeat until interrupted]</p>
    <p>Weh non!  Copper!  An’ purty fins!</p>
    <p>An’ here all them years later, Boudreaux’s family still goin’ up an down the rivers, tradin’ fer things that might please Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros.  An’ Thibodeaux’s family still slinks ‘bout down under the sea makin’ themselves as pretty as can be.  An they done forgot all ‘bout their fight ‘bout whose fault it was that they done got themselves ass-lost, but they ain’t never gon’ stop fightin ‘bout who is the better elf, not till Grand-mère Grand-père Calestros picks a favorite.  An’ that ain’t gon’ happen, cause She loves all us elves the same.</p>';
