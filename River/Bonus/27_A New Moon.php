    <h1>A New Moon</h1>
    <p>It has been a slightly colder winter than usual this year. Not so bad as the harsh winter a few years back, but enough so that even in Winter Quarters there is a light snowfall in the days leading up to Elfmas. It’s not enough to stick, but it’s more than usual.</p>
    <p>In the cold weather, Allophryne bundles himself up in his warmest clothing and even dons his armor for an extra layer to keep the warmth in.  Like many river elves, he doesn’t technically have a home of his own.  When in Winter Quarters, he stays in the nice, cozy house that the younger officers of the Brave Beavers share together.</p>
    <p>A benefit of sleeping in hammocks is that it’s not terribly hard to hang another when needed.</p>
    <p>To make <a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Allophryne&where-species=ruthveni" target="_blank">Ruthveni</a> more comfortable with having to put up with her old man hanging around, he’s always willing to do chores.  And today’s chore is hanging a lantern over the doorway where she could not quite reach.  He’s just about got it onto its hook by manipulating it with a spare giggin’ stick when he’s interrupted.</p>
    <p>The heavy thump of boots could only signal the approach of one person in Winter Quarters. Allophryne looks up to see Bryti approaching, dressed in her normal clothes even though she’s in elven form. Of course, he knows after over two years of traveling with her that the cold does not bother her. She smiles slightly as she approaches.</p>
    <p>“I could help with that, you know,” she tells him as she comes to a halt next to him.</p>
    <p>“Mais la - I’d ‘preciate it, me.”  Allophryne gives her an easy smile and puts the weapon down to retrieve the lantern.</p>
    <p>Bryti shifts to her hybrid form and steps towards Allophryne. With little warning, he has the somewhat alarming feeling of being lifted bodily off the ground by the werewolf. With a modest effort, Bryti places Allophryne on her shoulder. The hook for the lantern is now easily in reach.</p>
    <p>“Following Blinkin’s diet advice lately, perhaps?” she grunts playfully. </p>
    <p>Allophryne bonks her between the ears with an elbow. Bryti actually laughs, then fakes a growl.</p>
    <p>"Be careful, elf," she speaks in a mock serious tone, "I have been known to bite those who irk me." </p>
    <p>This is the scene that Ruthveni as she steps out of her doorway with a ladder: Her father perched on a nearly eight foot tall werewolf's shoulder digging his elbow into her head like a school child while she growls threats at him.</p>
    <p>Bryti blinks and looks down as she steps out of the doorway. Her expression is surprisingly sheepish.</p>
    <p>"Hello Ruthveni," she greets the elf who has never seen her in hybrid form, "I was not going to bite him." </p>
    <p>“Merry Elfmas to you too, Loup Garou.”  Ruthveni blinks in surprise.  This is not what she was expecting at all.</p>
    <p>“Merry… Elfmas?” Bryti waves politely. </p>
    <p>Allophryne quickly hangs the lantern over the doorway and sits up straighter on the werewolf’s shoulders.</p>
    <p>“Jus’ gettin’ in the holiday spirit, ‘sall, Ruthi.  She ain’t mean no harm of it,” Alloprhyne tries to explain.  “<small>Weh, an you can put me down now.</small>”</p>
    <p>“Sorry,” Bryti clears her throat and politely sets down her compatriot, “I have a curious sense of humor.” </p>
    <p>Allophryne coughs a little.</p>
    <p>“It’s okay,” the soldier says with a shrug, “Maybe you ken howl or som’thin so folks remember what the holiday’s all ‘bout, weh?”</p>
    <p>“About that,” Bryti tilts her head, “Elfmas is… not the holiday I normally celebrate on the solstice. I have heard of Elfmas, the exchanging of gifts and everything, but no one has told me what it’s actually about. Why would <i>howling</i> remind people of that?” </p>
    <p>Allophryne looks a little embarrassed, but decides to just go for it.</p>
    <p>“We done picked up the holiday from the Blade Elves, see.  Fer’ them, the last couple centuries meant that on th’ midwinter Solstice they’d be keepin’ extra watches.  It were a guard for their loved ones against th’ werewolves that took t’ huntin’ em.”  Allophryne doesn’t try to sugarcoat the history.</p>
    <p>“But now they’s ain’t got to really be all worried, since there ain’t no rogue wolves out there decidin’ t’ eat elves no more.  So they keep th’ vigil, but them’s that aren’t on watch come to visit them at their posts with hot drinks, an carolin’, an everyone shares presents come dawn.  It’s turnin’ into a good thing.”  He pauses, and comtemplates.  “I hear some’s at the fort even dress up as a werewolf to play-spook the guards.”</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Bryti notes, suddenly looking very self conscious of her hybrid form. She shifts back to elf before continuing to speak.</p>
    <p>“Oh…” She sighs wearily, “The hunt… The winter solstice was… is our holiest day, the day when Luna and the ancestor constellations are closest to us. I… suppose some more ruthless followers would choose to honor the Huntress in such a manner.”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t…” she looks to Ruthveni and Allophryne sadly, “It… is not a good feeling to know that your holiest night has turned into a celebration of the fact that your entire culture is gone.” </p>
    <p>“Ain’t all gone.”  Ruthveni corrects the werewolf still standing on her doorstep.  “You’re here, an Dad’s learnin’ what you got to teach.  It’s shore got him turnt his whole life around.  I think it can teach us somethin, me.”  She steps back and holds the curtain open.  “Come’on in an’ tell us all ‘bout it.  Maybe we celebrate your holiday with you, weh?”</p>
    <p>Bryti looks at Ruthveni with obvious surprise. She looks from Allophryne, the to the door.</p>
    <p>“I… think I might like that,” she inclines her head to Ruthveni, “I don’t know if you’d want to, with how I do so, but I would like to talk about it I think. I have celebrated it alone for the last fifteen years. I’m the last one left who does, as far as I know, and… it is not something meant to be celebrated alone. One thing first though...”</p>
    <p>Bryti turns to Allophryne and takes something out from under her cloak.</p>
    <p>“I don’t celebrate Elfmas, Allophryne, but you do. This is for you.”</p>
    <p>Bryti holds out her gift. It is a holy symbol of Luna, made from mithral and on a fine chain. It is in far more detail than the one she originally made for him. The reverse side of the amulet contains a holy symbol of Calestros, the two circles lining up like two sides of a coin.</p>
    <p>“I thought this might be symbolic,” she explains, “And a little better than that one I improvised. I had to sneak a little of the mithral shipments that have been moving through, but the traders seemed happy to let me have some. Here.” </p>
    <p>Allophryne is touched.  He immediately puts on the amulet, letting it fall to whichever side fate chooses.</p>
    <p>“Huh.”  Ruthveni muses, “Interestin’ how they’ve got such a similar symbol there, weh?  Like sisters, non?”</p>
    <p>“Th’ moon does pull the tide, weh,” her father answers thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>“Or maybe circles are easy to draw,” Bryti comments with a raised eyebrow, “But… I don’t know. Maybe there is something. Maybe not.  Either way, I can still tell you how I honor Luna’s night.”</p>
    <p>With that, Bryti gestures to Allophryne and steps into the barracks.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>“You know all the howlin’ will shore sound a lot dumber if’n it’s me sayin’ awoo,” Allophryne says sarcastically.</p>
    <p>Bryti lowers her head and gives him a sideways look. She has led the two other elves deeper into the mangrove forest surrounding Winter Quarters. On a dry patch of land in an area distant from the traps surrounding the hidden settlement she has quietly constructed a circular grove. </p>
    <p>With no stones present, she has had to improvise. Marked pieces of wood take the place of stone monoliths surrounding the clearing and a perfectly circular pool of water takes the place of the stone holy symbol usually placed in the center of such a holy site.</p>
    <p>Bryti sits cross-legged in her hybrid form next to the pool with Allophryne and Ruthveni beside her. She has left her armor and weapons just outside the circle, wearing only her simple clothing.</p>
    <p>“Well, I normally do this fully wolf,” Bryti explains, “but I thought that would be rude to our guest. The howling is my way of doing this, it’s all rather personal.”</p>
    <p>Bryti pauses, looking thoughtful.</p>
    <p>“Thank you for coming,” she says more seriously, “This is something I used to do with my family. This is something you are supposed to do with those you are closest to, those you trust the most. I’ve been doing it alone for years, and it feels like… you’re helping me take something back. This means a lot to me.”</p>
    <p>“Mais, a’course we’ll help.”  Ruthveni shoots her dad a dirty look for having been so rude.  “Jus’ you say what you need us to do, weh?”</p>
    <p>“I… am actually not certain,” Bryti ponders, “This is something that is very personal, to each clan or family. We are supposed to remember the first Lycans who gathered in groves like this, and remember the night that Luna first Chose them, but well… obviously that doesn’t really apply to you. It is also, however, for remembering your family, and the bonds that keep you.”</p>
    <p>“For us, those bonds are everything. We aren’t so much a single race as a group of kindred souls. I am an elf and a wolf. I may know someone who is a human and a bear. We are both Lycans. Bonds like that, of spirit more than body, are the reason we <i>exist</i>. Without that, without trusting those other kindred souls, our ancestors would still be lost and wandering the wild alone. We wouldn’t be a people. So, we must remember that and honor it, when She is closest to us.”</p>
    <p>Bryti takes a breath.</p>
    <p>“And I most certainly have such a bond here. Allophryne… I wouldn’t be here without you, and not just physically. I feel more like myself than I ever have since I lost my family. When we met, I was lost. I was still just the Seeker, the Tourist. Bound to kill afflicted until I fall. Now… I am not better, but I am here. I owe a lot of that to you… and to what you saw in me. Even when I couldn’t see it myself.” </p>
    <p>Allophryne blushes very much greener in the dim starlight.  He’s touched by the sentimentality of the moment.</p>
    <p>“Weh, you’ve both done foun’t new purposes in recent years,” Ruthveni reaches out and places a hand on her father’s shoulder.  “An’ I think that’s a thing worth celebratin’, me.”  </p>
    <p>She pauses to elbow her dad.</p>
    <p>“An’ maybe we ken make new family traditions wi’ our cousine?” Ruthveni continues, “Weh, if’n it ain’t a howl, we ken always sing.”</p>
    <p>“Certainly,” Bryti laughs, “Though I warn you, my howling voice and my singing voice are alarmingly similar.” </p>
    <p>“Never said we could sing <i>well</i>,” Ruthveni playfully responds.</p>
    <p>“Singing it is then,” Bryti nods, “Come on, Allophryne, weren’t you trying to teach me some songs in Sylvan? I’m sure I can make a better attempt this time.” </p>
    <p>“Weh!” Allophryne agrees.  And he thoughtfully picks a song about the tide.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>It is well known that river elves sing songs at Elfmas to keep the loup garou at bay. Families and communities stay up late at night, singing and listening in turn. If, during a quiet time, the family hears howling, the tradition is that they sing the loudest and best song they have.</p>
    <p>And, as the story goes, if you sing well enough sometimes the howling in the distance turns into singing as well.</p>
