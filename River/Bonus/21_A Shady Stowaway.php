    <h1>A Shady Stowaway</h1>
    <p>"Let me know if you need any more tea!" Eina calls out the trap door to the retreating plaps of the elf on the above deck.  “Add honey if it’s too sharp tasting too!”</p>
    <p>She receives an acknowledgement as a reply and heads back below the top deck to tidy up the work space.  She’s most definitely happy for dear <a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/browseimgs/photos_Pelophryne.html">Pelophryne</a>.  It’s good for the flotilla to be increasing its numbers naturally instead of relying entirely on immigration.  If only she didn’t have so many obligations of her own, perhaps that could be in her future as well.</p>
    <p>But for now, she has to see to her tasks.  The sheets on the guest hammock need changing so that her next visitor will have a fresh set.</p>
    <p>One would think that spending six months aboard the newest ships of Envoyer would have been enough time to become comfortable with the idea of a true below deck, but some 200 odd years of life on single-level rafts is a lot of inertia to overcome.  The ship’s gentle rock beneath her feet is comfortingly familiar, even if the closed in walls are not.</p>
    <p>Tiny round windows dot the sides of the ship.  Their exceedingly high tech little sheets of glass let in just enough light for the river elves to see by.  The space is dim, but not uncomfortably so.  Eina finds that the diffuse light is comforting, especially when the sun overhead is at its brightest and there is no shady riverbank to escape to.</p>
    <p>She heads through the workroom with its food storage and preparation area to the guest room.  Eina collects the used sheets from the hammock and heads back to the fore of the ship, still thinking to herself about all the strange changes that they’ve gone through on this side of the continent, and how good it feels to be in motion.</p>
    <p>She pulls open the cabinet for linens and looks through the folded piles.  She doesn’t want to put grey or black sheets on the guest hammock, so she tugs on the white sheet at the bottom of the pile.</p>
    <p>Odd, it seems to take a little more effort than it should. Eina gives it a sharp tug. Suddenly, the whole pile comes loose. The linens fall on top of her, then something heavy bumps into her and topples to the floor.</p>
    <p>Eina steps back in surprise as a person hits the floor in a heap with an awkward squeaking noise. There is a flutter of sheets. She has just enough time to make out pale skin, black hair, black eyes, and the unmistakable huge ears of a cryptid before the elf looks up at her, hisses, and immediately vanishes.</p>
    <p>Before she has a chance to react in any way, a small black cat flails its way out of the sheets. It looks up at Eina briefly. It eyes dart around the room in panic before settling back on her.</p>
    <p>“Um, meow?” it says in a masculine voice.</p>
    <p>Eina cannot help herself.  She sits down on the floor and just laughs.  Each time she almost gets ahold of herself, she pictures a highly dignified Cryptid hiding in her linens and laughs again.  When finally reduced to just the occasional giggle, she grins at the cat and hiccups.</p>
    <p>“Mais!  So you’re them theif what keeps emptyin’ th’ live well!”  She has to pause to giggle again.  “Oh minou, I shoulda known we were feedin extra mouths, me!”  </p>
    <p>Eina folds her arms around her knees and smiles at the cat.</p>
    <p>“So <span class="tooltip">Minou<span class="tooltiptext">Cat</span></span>, what’s got you two hidin’ up in here?”</p>
    <p>“Aw,” the cat folds its tail around itself and sits up, “I thought I was really convincing there. Gig’s up, boss.”</p>
    <p>There is a brief silent pause.</p>
    <p>“Boss, we’re on a <i>boat</i>.”</p>
    <p>“Fine,” a voice speaks behind Eina, oddly less dry and raspy than other cryptids.</p>
    <p>Eina turns to see her. The cryptid is leaning against the other wall of the small room with her arms folded. She has pearl white skin and jet black hair that goes down nearly to her waist, which she is currently glaring at Eina through with the unmistakable expression that only grumpy teenagers are capable of. She’s clad in a white silk wrap worn like a dress, and is much shorter than the other cryptids Eina has seen at only about six feet.</p>
    <p>“Boo,” the young cryptid sighs glumly.</p>
    <p>“Oh mais, I am a-skeert!” Eina pantomimes a faint.  “Other’n tryin’t put the scare on me, what’s got you two on board?  I hopes you ain’t got lost or nuthin when we embarked, me.”</p>
    <p>“No,” the cryptid replies, “Hid.”</p>
    <p>“<small>Jeeze try and be a little more diplomatic…</small>” The cat mutters.</p>
    <p>“Shut up, Eyeswith,” The cryptid says to the cat. The cat, presumably Eyeswith, rolls said eyes and does not reply.</p>
    <p>“Is there somewhere you’re tryin t’git then?”  Eina looks between the girl and the cat.  “We’re usually happy t’ave a passenger, mais this a not so great leg o’the trip fer it.”</p>
    <p>“Away,” she answers, looking a bit crestfallen, “Just… wanted to get away.” </p>
    <p>“Away, hemm?”  Eina stands up again so that she doesn’t have to look up at the younger elf.  “Mais, that we can also do.  Your family knows you’re goin, I ‘opes?”</p>
    <p>Eyeswith trots over to the cryptid and swats her in the ankle. The cryptid backs away a few steps an grumbles slightly. The cat glares up at her.</p>
    <p>“Um,” she answers awkwardly, “Maybe… no?”</p>
    <p>“I ken send ‘em a message, let ‘em know where you done got to, if’n you want.  Mais, though we ain’t gon’ turn round to jus drop off one person.”  Eina pauses, remembering who she’s talking to.  “Less someone thinks it’s important ‘nuff t magic up a teleport - an thems might no be able to while we’re out at sea, non - yer here fer the duration.” </p>
    <p>“No message!” the cryptid waves her hands, “Um, it’s fine, they’re fine, nothing’s wrong, they uh, don’t mind…”</p>
    <p>She is not convincing. Eyeswith swats her ankle again.</p>
    <p>Eina can sometimes understand a subtle message in subtext.  She chooses not to press the probably abused child for information on her abusers.  She’ll just be sending a message to Still that one of her flock is missing, but in a safe place, when she gets a chance.</p>
    <p>For now though...</p>
    <p>“Would you rather have somethin’ to eat?  Them fishes taste better if’n they’re prepared right.”</p>
    <p>“Can’t eat cooked food…” she answers quietly.</p>
    <p>Eina shrugs.  She’s been to a few potlucks with Cryptids before.  She gets it.</p>
    <p>“That’s fine, weh.  We’s all got dietary restrictions up in here.”  Eina takes an earthenware crock from the cupboard and begins to prep a brine.  “There ain’t no fire on here t’cook with, mais we ken still make a fish taste better ‘en jus’ leavin’ it plain like Theria made it.  That goddess ain’t the best chef, non?”</p>
    <p>While snatching a fish from the live well, she gestures to the girl and cat.</p>
    <p>“Yall jus’ fold them sheets up right for me, an set aside a set fer the guest room.  Whichever you want is fine.”</p>
    <p>“Okay…” the cryptid slowly steps towards the pile of linens. Suddenly, the cat swats her again.</p>
    <p>“<i>Ow!</i>” she hisses at him, “What?... Oh. You can talk again.”</p>
    <p>“<i>Finally</i>,” Eyeswith yelps, “Don’t be so rude!”</p>
    <p>“Oh, right,” the cryptid turns towards Eina, “You can call me Shady.” </p>
    <p>“Merci Shady,” Eina says with a small smile while gutting the fish, “It’s good you came on board this ship.  We’re the only one with real space for guests.  When y’fix yer bed, you can pull the curtain round fer privacy.”</p>
    <p>"So… I can stay?" Shady asks cautiously. She begins folding back the blankets. As she puts one back, she takes a small satchel out of her hiding spot and opens it, showing her a few sewing needles and thread.</p>
    <p>"I can help out…" she offers, "Sew? Fix clothes and blankets? If you let me stay…"</p>
    <p>"She's really good at it," Eyeswith flicks his tail around, "Really! She made that dress she's wearing."</p>
    <p>"Yeah…" Shady agrees sheepishly.</p>
    <p>“We’re always happy t’have more hands’a’helpin around hereabouts,” Eina answers patiently, “Mais you don’t gotta worry about payin’ fer yer stay.  You look young ‘nuff to be doin your apprentice trainin’.  ‘At means ‘s long as yer learnin somethin from us we’ve got to keep you.”  </p>
    <p>Eina offers a small chunk of fish to the cat with her chopsticks.</p>
    <p>“So are you willin’ to learn?”</p>
    <p>Eyeswith noms the bite happily and nods to Shady happily.</p>
    <p>"Okay," Shady says quietly, "What will I learn?"</p>
    <p>“Whelp,” Eina laughs, “fer starters, since you’re here wi’ me, you’re welcome to apprentice at the duties of a priest or cleric.  I’m Eina, by the by, an that’s my job right now.  We’ve also got a tinker aboard, an engineer, an’ two craftselves.  You’ll have the pick of em when they’re not busy crewin’ the ship.”</p>
    <p>"Oh," Shady says, "That… sounds nice. They'll be okay with me?"</p>
    <p>Eina shrugs.</p>
    <p>“Will you be okay with them?”</p>
    <p>"Maybe…" Shady sits down as she puts the last blanket back, "Um… I've never been around so many new people before. Not sure if I'll be weird, but I want to… meet people."</p>
    <p>Eyeswith trots up next to Shady and gives her a soft headbutt.</p>
    <p>"You'll be okay," He says to her, "You're awesome, they'll love you."</p>
    <p>"Of course you say that," Shady says to him as she scratches him behind the ears, "You have to…"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, but I mean it too," Eyeswith agrees and rubs against her hand.</p>
    <p>"I'll try," Shady says quietly to Eina. </p>
    <p>“Weh, that’s something you can learn too.”  Eina gives her a slow smile, and hands over a plate of fish slices sprinkled with herbs and little bowl of a spicy dipping sauce.  “An when we meet up with th’ other flotilla, maybe you’d like to spend time with other apprentices an make some peer friends here.”</p>
    <p>Eina does not point out that Shady has not mentioned missing any friends at home, or the fact that Shady's large ears literally perk up at that word.</p>
    <p>"Okay," Shady agrees shyly.</p>
    <p>She gingerly takes the plate, handling the chopsticks confidently. She sniffs the fish and the sauce cautiously. She very slightly dips one slice of fish an nibbles it.</p>
    <p>"Ooh!" Her eyes go wide, "Yum!"</p>
    <p>She quickly devours the one slice and goes back to grab another. Eyeswith gently baps her with a paw.</p>
    <p>"Oh," Shady blinks and looks up at Eina, "Thanks miss Eina… for being so nice."</p>
    <p>“Oh cher, thanks for giving me the chance.”  </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>It takes a few weeks to see land again, and it is definitely a welcome sight.  Eina stands on the deck to watch the sunset while Shady is below helping one of the Bufonidae cousins with dinner preparations.  They’d caught a swordfish and there was a lot of it to prepare.</p>
    <p>Eina reflects on how fortunate they are to have received their new guest.  She’d Sent a message to Still before they’d lost sight of land, but hadn’t heard anything back yet.</p>
    <p>The reply comes in a typical cryptid fashion.</p>
    <p>"Hello," Ink says from slightly behind Eina, "You have Shady."</p>
    <p>Eina tries not to show how startled she is.  It’s one thing to have Smilisca appearing on the ship unexpectedly, but an entirely different thing altogether to have someone who really <i>shouldn’t</i> know Envoyer’s location just appearing on the deck.  A shiver runs down her spine.</p>
    <p>“Hello Ink!” her voice is slightly higher pitch than usual.  “Yes, Shady is here.”</p>
    <p>"Is she okay?" Ink asks, stepping up next to her along the railing, giving her a worried look. </p>
    <p>“Weh,” Eina answers, “she seems happy.”</p>
    <p>Ink doesn't answer that for a moment. His ears tilt a little bit as he looks at Eina.</p>
    <p>"She has to stay safe," he says, "She is… important."</p>
    <p>“Can she keep a secret?” Eina asks, cautiously.</p>
    <p>Something resembling a smile crosses Ink's face.</p>
    <p>"Yes," he answers. </p>
    <p>“Mais then that settles it.”  Eina leans back to look all the way up at Ink’s face.  “She ken come with us to Winter Quarters if she still wants ‘t stay.  I ain’t gon’ kick her out.”</p>
    <p>"Oh," Ink looks like he is going to say something, then stops. He squints slightly at the sunset she was watching before turning back to Eina.</p>
    <p>"She's… happy?" He asks. </p>
    <p>“Seems so,” Eina answers.  “She warms up slow, but she’s fitting in well.  I notice she handles herself real real well among adults for someone so young.  She ain’t gettin to spend much time with friends her age at home, weh?”</p>
    <p>"No," Ink admits, "She is the… no, she does not."</p>
    <p>“Smilisca’s apprentice, Acris, is in a similar place.”  Eina sighs and leans against the railing.  “There aren’t all that many kids left in that generation, non?  Too many grew up too too quick and too many won’t ever.  It’ll be good for her, weh, to spend time wi’ her peers.”</p>
    <p>Ink watches Eina for several seconds.</p>
    <p>"I… don't remember," he says, "What it's like to be… a kid."</p>
    <p>“Non, adults rarely do.”  Eina shakes her head.  “An what we do remember ain’t gon’ be relevant to what it’s like for them, being kids <i>now,</i> in a different place an wit such big big changes between yesterday and today.  That’s why it’s so hard for us to understan’ ‘em.  An why they need to have friends what do.”</p>
    <p>"Yes…" Ink mutters a little bit, "Shouldn't turn out… like me."</p>
    <p>Ink sighs quietly.</p>
    <p>"You will make sure she is safe?" He asks. </p>
    <p>“As safe as she can be, weh,” Eina agrees.  “I can check in wi’ you on a schedule if’n you want?  Jus’ let you know how she do?”</p>
    <p>"That… would be nice," Ink says, "You have a kind soul, Eina. You will help her."</p>
    <p>Eina blushes and does not acknowledge the compliment.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know you had a daughter, Ink,” she says quietly, “Thank you for trusting us wi’ her.”</p>
    <p>"Um," Ink blinks a few times, "Uncle… sort of. Skulk's goddaughter. Her parents… not around." </p>
    <p>“Oh!” Eina looks at him in surprise.  “I’m sorry!  I assumed!  I should not have done that, non.”  She stops herself from blabbering at one of the notoriously most shy of the notoriously shy cryptids and folds her webbed hands.  “I’m glad she still has someone in her life what would come this far t’find her.  It’s what a good father would do, weh.  She’s loved.  That’s what matters.”</p>
    <p>"Oh," Ink's voice cracks slightly and he turns his head away from her slightly, "I'm… trying. Please help her make friends."</p>
    <p>Eina reaches out and gently pats him on the arm.  She can’t quite reach his shoulder without it being a bit awkward and requiring stole adjustments.</p>
    <p>“She’ll do fine,” the cleric comforts the taller elf, “just you see.  Mais - she’ll git to see more of her cousin elves, an’ maybe thems in that lost generation gap will be able to find each other.  Weh.  She’ll do fine.”</p>
    <p>"Okay," Ink turns back to her, "Thank you." </p>
    <p>“Do you want t’say goodbye?”</p>
    <p>"I… don't know," he gives Eina a surprisingly vulnerable look, "Should I…? Don't want to be…" he trails off.</p>
    <p>“You know ‘er best,” Eina answers, “If you want to, you can blame me.  Jus say I invited you for dinner to talk ‘bout that incense you swapped us.  Mais, I couldn’t have known she were yers.  It’d be all innocence.”</p>
    <p>Ink closes his eyes and thinks for a couple minutes.</p>
    <p>"No," he finally answers, "She's clever. She would know. Doesn't trust me… and… she needs to trust you." </p>
    <p>“In that case...” Eina gives Ink a sideways half hug.  “Don’t be a stranger, you hear!  I expect you to drop by for a visit in the spring, weh!”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” once again, Ink looks like he might actually be smiling, “I will not be a stranger. Goodbye, Eina.”</p>
    <p>Shockingly enough, Ink doesn’t immediately vanish. He actually waits for her to say goodbye. </p>
