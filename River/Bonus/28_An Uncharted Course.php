    <h1>An Uncharted Course</h1>
    <p>The fallhopper is an incredible sight. Even when disassembled, it is still clearly an impressive feat of engineering that rises to the entire height of Aborder falls. It is an entirely different experience to see it in motion, and it is still extremely rare for non-river elves to see that sight.</p>
    <p>One could waste hours watching the intricate yet massive mechanisms of the fallhopper work, churning with fluid power as they slowly raise the packed up rafts up the falls. They move with such grace that it is hard to remember that these are rafts the size of houses. Indeed, it is poetry in motion, a secret wonder of the world.</p>
    <p>Even that, however, gets boring after a while. It takes over a week for a flotilla to traverse the fallhopper. While Acris has seen it before, Cel and Nobody have not. The Navigator’s raft was one of the first to be elevated up the falls, and that was an exciting experience. That was three days ago. They spent hours watching it at first, but now it seems a fact of life and merely backdrop for Cel, Acris, and Nobody’s conversation. </p>
    <p>“Nobody! Hey Nobody!” Cel shouts, barely audible over the regular roar of the waterfall, and clearly as energized as ever. “What’s the biggest monster you think we’ll see? Huh?” </p>
    <p>Nobody actually puts a great deal of thought into her response; after all, this is an opportunity to show off her new education.</p>
    <p>“One of the largest, most dangerous predators of all are glacier toads.  So… I think the biggest would be… a <i>Dire</i> Glacier Toad.”  She shivers at the very thought.</p>
    <p>“A dire glacier toad?” Cel says, leaning in. “What’s dire about it?”</p>
    <p>“A dire creature is a big big version,” Acris tries to answer correctly, but being somewhat unsure sticks with the vaguest statements he can.  “Weh!  Big big an real ‘ornery.”</p>
    <p>Nobody nods. “Indeed.  And the larger they get, the more orny they become.  So that would certainly be…”  She stops, a sudden, terrifying thought occurring to her.  She looks to Acris.  “...there are… limits, to how large a creature can become, correct?  You could not have… a Dire ...<i>Roc</i>, for instance?”  She hesitates to even put voice to such a horrible threat.</p>
    <p>Acris’s eyes go wide as saucers.</p>
    <p>“Probably?”  He shrugs.  “Mais so... can we git back to the raft now?  I got somethin’ neat I been workin on an... Please?”</p>
    <p>At Acris’ noncommittal response, Nobody’s eyes leap skyward.  </p>
    <p>“...Yes.  We should do that.  It is wise to be beneath roofs.”</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The Hylidae family raft has essentially been commandeered by teenagers these days. Litoria has, for whatever reason, been absent since they set off down the Goldfall. Smilisca has been doing an admirable job of continuing to educate and assist “Acris and the girls,” but he is severely outnumbered. The only other resident of the raft is a small black cat that has been seen darting around, but oddly makes little to no noise.</p>
    <p>Smilisca is absent as the wary teenagers pile into the raft, busy overseeing the fallhopper. The cat sits atop their piles of study materials and stares judgingly at the crowd with its tail flicking. Acris closes the curtains of the raft and turns to his friends as they enter. </p>
    <p>“We been talkin, ‘bout maybe tryin’ta go map a crik,” he states without preamble in the dimly lit room.  “Weh, I got dis cord all prepped fer mappin an errythin!  If’n we just wait for it t’git a little bit darker an all of us can go!”</p>
    <p>“...An then it’ll be too dark for Rocs, weh.”</p>
    <p>The cat makes a polite <i>Ahem</i> noise. This is not a normal cat expression, much less in a relatively deep masculine voice. Nothing seems to happen for several seconds. The cat repeats the noise, slightly more insistently. </p>
    <p>Cel stares at the cat. “...Acris,” she says. “I think you’ve got a doppleganger infestation. Someone’s replaced your cat with a cat that doesn’t know what <i>meow</i> sounds like.” 	</p>
    <p>“Meow,” the cat says sarcastically. </p>
    <p>Acris looks remarkably disappointed.</p>
    <p>“Eyeswith, we talked about this, weh?”  He sits on one of the kitchen cushions with a heavy thump.  “Ain’t no good to hide forever.”</p>
    <p>Cel turns and looks at Acris. “So… you knew your cat doesn’t know how to meow?” She squints at him. “...How do we know <i>you’re</i> not a doppleganger?”</p>
    <p>“Ain’t my cat,” Acris answers.</p>
    <p>“It’s mine,” says a voice <i>immediately</i> behind Cel. </p>
    <p>“That’s exactly what a doppleganger would say,” Cel says, pointedly continuing to stare at Acris. “Nice voice-trick though, but I’ve seen through yer trick. The <i>real</i> Acris can’t throw anything, much less ‘is voice.” </p>
    <p>“Cel,” Nobody says carefully, “I... do not think it is a trick.  Unless it is a very good trick.”</p>
    <p>“Nah, it’s definitely an illusion,” Cel says. “Watch this.” She moves as if to turn swiftly around, but instead kicks her heel back right where (in her terrible imagination) a person’s shin might be.</p>
    <p>Cel is somewhat alarmed by the fact that her foot <i>does</i> brush against something. The voice behind her responds with a slightly annoyed “Hey!” </p>
    <p>Cel pauses. “...Okay, fine,” she says. “I guess it’s not dopplegangers.” She turns to Nobody. “Nobody, please describe whatever hideous adominablenation is standing behind me. I refuse to look at it now.” </p>
    <p>“Rude,” scoffs the voice. </p>
    <p>“Err… It’s… um… they’re… somewhat…”</p>
    <p>“<i>Honk</i>,” Gander supplies from somewhere around Nobody’s ankles.</p>
    <p>“Yes.  That.  Um.  And also, I think, correct.  I think you… we… are being rude.”</p>
    <p>“Probably,” Cel says. “So’s standing behind a person and not introducing yourself. Also, pretending to be a talking cat.”</p>
    <p>“I ain’t pretending,” Scoffs the cat. </p>
    <p>Nobody considers this.  “That also seems true.  But I think… they may have the right of rude here?  We were the first to resort to physical harm…”  She seems deep in thought, attempting to remember various lectures on Lowlands ‘manners’. </p>
    <p>“My apologies for the presumption, sirrah cat,” Cel says, giving a quick salute. She sighs. “Fine.” She turns around, arms folded, and gives whomever is standing behind her a suitably Cel-like appraisal of villainy (which looks rather like a pout.)</p>
    <p>The figure standing behind Cel is short, for a cryptid elf. She’s only a little bit over six  feet tall. She is wearing a long silk wrap formed into a dress and has black hair that falls loosely almost to her waist. She raises a hand and wiggles long fingers at Cel.</p>
    <p>“Hi,” the young cryptid elf states, “I’m Shady.” </p>
    <p>“Nice to meet ya,” Cel says mildly. “You’re a Crypt Elf, right? I don’t think I’ve met one before.”</p>
    <p>“Crypt<i>id</i> elf,” Shady corrects haughtily as the cat prances across the room to jump into her arms, “And you haven’t… that you know of.” </p>
    <p>“...At this point, we should indicate ourselves, I think?  I am known as Nobody.  For reference, I have been made aware that the name is unusual.”</p>
    <p>“Sounds okay to me,” Shady tilts her head at Nobody, “And I know. You’re Nobody. You’re Cel. I’ve been watching. You seem nice.” </p>
    <p>Cel nods, accepting this as normal behavior. “Is sir cat also a Cryptid elf -- or Cryptid Cat, I guess?”</p>
    <p>The cat laughs at that.</p>
    <p>"He's Eyes Without a Face," Shady explains, "I call him Eyeswith. He's… sort of a cat."</p>
    <p>"I consider myself a cat," Eyeswith proclaims haughtily. </p>
    <p>“I’ll take your word for it,” Cel says. She walks over to a pile of blankets in the corner, and fishes a small, fat hippopotamus out of her hiding spot. “This is Boots,” Cel says, wrestling the wiggling hippo into her arms. “In case you haven’t met yet. Pretty sure neither cats nor hippos are natural predators of each other, but I wanted to get that out there before anyone gets any natural predating on their mind or something.”</p>
    <p>She glances over at Shady. “So, you joining the party?”</p>
    <p>Shady gently taps the baby hippo on the snout, eliciting a bleary warble from the sleepy creature. She looks up from the aggressively adorable animal to the group of young elves in front of her. Her eyes dart back and forth between them briefly.</p>
    <p>"Um... party?" She asks nervously. </p>
    <p>“You know, adventuring party,” Cel says, pulling a bit of lettuce from a side pocket and offering it to Boots. “Band of heroes, quartet of champions, gang of good-deed-doers, that kind of thing.” She gives the rest of the room a quick scan. “I don’t see any other Cryptid Elves about… and we could use a fourth member…”</p>
    <p>"Um…" Shady's eyes go a little wide and her voice gets a bit shaky, "I'm… not… any of that." </p>
    <p>Cel looks disappointed for a second, but nods. “Fair. It’s a rough life. Acris and I almost got eaten by wererats once.”</p>
    <p>"Plural?" Shady blinks and looks at Acris.</p>
    <p>Acris shrugs. Shady gives him a wide eyed look before turning back to Cel.</p>
    <p>"Sorry," she says regretfully, "Can't be much of an adventurer. Can't go out in daylight."</p>
    <p>“Even ghosts get to be adventurers,” Cel says, slumping backwards onto a hammock. “Heard a story about it once. Couldn’t come out in daytime or anything. Not everyone has to be an adventurer anyway. ...Which reminds me: Acris, you said you had something neat you were working on?” </p>
    <p>Acris holds up his short piece of cord with muted triumph.</p>
    <p>“Weh.  I’m makin’ a real map ‘a somewhere et hasn’t been mapped yet.”  But then he looks somewhat sad again.  “I got a spell what can help wi’ the light thing.  Or we ken try goin’ in the evenin’ when it ain’t too bright.  There’s a crik not far from here what could use a mappin.”</p>
    <p>“Sounds good to me, either way,” Cel says. “At least it’s not ‘sitting around the raft all day’ again.”</p>
    <p>Shady's extremely large ears perk up at Acris' statement.</p>
    <p>"You have a spell?" She asks, "You mean… I can come?" </p>
    <p>“Weh?”  Acris looks confused.  “Why you think I kept borrowin’ Eyeswit?”</p>
    <p>"Oh," Shady says bashfully, "I'll come with." </p>
    <p>“Then it appears there is a consensus,” Nobody states needlessly. “We shall map a crick.  I’m even fairly certain I know what that means.” Her voice rises slightly at the end.  Sounds like she almost managed to make an exclamation point.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>A crick, it seems, is some kind of small river. Nobody is not sure where the etymological distinction between a crick, a stream, and a brook lies, but she has determined that this is not a bayou. It is far too fast.</p>
    <p>The “party” has piled onto a long canoe. With Acris steering the canoe from the rear, Nobody sits near the middle, with Shady and Cel sitting near the front. Cel, of course, is lecturing Shady on the proper form for paddling even though she barely knows more than the cryptid.</p>
    <p>Shady is only partially listening. She has been protected by the Penumbra cantrip that Acris has placed on her. She hasn’t spoken about it, but it she’s acting like this is the first time that she has ever been outside during daylight. She is staring absently at the horizon.</p>
    <p>It’s slow going up the strong current as they head away from the falls. The terrain is rocky and barren, but the slowly rising canyons on the approach to Asavardi provide excellent views. They are, of course, a group of mostly scrawny teenagers and Acris can’t paddle forever.</p>
    <p>Eventually, they take a break. They come to a fork in the swiftly flowing creek, with a slightly narrower stream branching away and moving swiftly in a very different direction than the falls. This is fascinating! This river is completely unmapped. Once they pull the canoe up onto the rocky shore, Acris immediately sits down and starts working on the small knotted piece of rope he has been using to map the river.</p>
    <p>As the group is sitting down to catch their breath and maybe snack a little, Shady keeps starting at the sky.</p>
    <p>“It’s pretty,” she eventually says. </p>
    <p>Cel nods. “Looks better than the Maar, at least.”</p>
    <p>“Haven’t been there,” Shady speaks without looking away. </p>
    <p>Nobody also gazes at the sky for a moment, but with a more suspicious expression than an awed one.  “It is a sight, but it is difficult to see the true scope from here.  There is always something… impeding.”  As an example, she holds out her hand at a nearby tree.   “If you were to see the full of the sky, and all it promises… you may not find it as... pretty.”</p>
    <p>“Sure!” Shady seems to agree quickly, “But I’m, um, not so good at climbing. It’s just a tree though...”</p>
    <p>Shady takes here eyes off the skyline and turns to follow Nobody to the tree. With a heavy, beleaguered sigh, Eyeswith trots along behind her. </p>
    <p>Nobody considers the tree, trying to find one of the branches capable of supporting her… generous mass.  Once selected, however, she slowly advances upward, cautiously.  Once this branch has been conquered, however, she reaches down an arm.</p>
    <p>Gander, of course, cheats, and simply picks a high point to perch on.</p>
    <p>Shady takes Nobody’s hand and manages to scramble her way into the tree with minimal awkwardness. Though her natural height is an advantage, she appears to have a little trouble pulling herself all the way up. </p>
    <p>Acris gives Shady a bit of a boost and then offers the same to Cel. Shady makes an awkward squawking noise as she is boosted into the tree, but manages the rest of the climb well enough. </p>
    <p>“Never was very good at climbing,” Cel mutters. She grabs Acris’ arm and hauls herself shakily into the tree. Shady is leaning against one of the branches looking out over the skyline.  Acris determines that the tree is now too full of elves for him to also attempt to climb it.</p>
    <p>“Still pretty,” she comments to Nobody quietly. </p>
    <p>Nobody considers that.  “Then perhaps I cannot appreciate it as you can.  To me… it does not seem pleasing.  It just… is.  Huge.  All encompassing.  Blanketing everything that is.  If it is pretty… then it is on accident.”</p>
    <p>Shady doesn’t respond to that, but continues looking at the sky. </p>
    <p>Cel shrugs. “...Does it really matter? Most things aren’t pretty on purpose. They just kind of happen.” She turns back to Shady. “Guess they don’t have the sky around a lot in where you’re from? Not judging, mind, just curious.” </p>
    <p>Shady sticks out a black tongue at Cel.</p>
    <p>“‘Course we have the sky,” she teases, “Just.. I’ve never looked at it in the day before. Hurts my eyes a lot. Acris’ spell lets me look at it, though. At night… you can see all the stars and the moon and clouds and everything so there’s lots to look at but here there’s more… color.”</p>
    <p>Shady pauses before looking back at Nobody.</p>
    <p>“It is kinda scary, but If it’s an accident,” She says, “I think I like it.” </p>
    <p>Something occurs to Nobody.  She looks down at the branch she is on.  </p>
    <p>“...To speak of accidents… I had selected this branch for my own weight… but had not accounted much further than that.  ...Perhaps we should get do-”</p>
    <p>“Getting down now!” Cel says, scrambling down the side of the tree. Shady blinks at her. Apparently, the branch is at least strong enough for two.</p>
    <p>“Why Nobody?” Shady quietly asks the crag elf. </p>
    <p>Nobody crinkles her brow.   She puts some thought into the question.</p>
    <p>“...Because… Causality?  Is this a Wisdom?” she asks uncertainly.</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Shady tilts her head, “You don’t pick your name?” </p>
    <p>It takes a moment, but realization hits.  “Ah.  No.  I did not.  I might have chosen another to pursue later, but… I would not have placed any great hope on doing so.”</p>
    <p>“No?” Shady asks, “So… you’re nobody?” </p>
    <p>“...Yes.  Perhaps we should not have skipped the introductory ritual.”</p>
    <p>Shady giggles at that.</p>
    <p>“Maybe,” she agrees, “I’m shady, you’re nobody… I think we got it down.” </p>
    <p>“Y- Oh, right.  Down.”  With that, Nobody begins her carefully measured descent. That carefully measured descent creates a creak, followed by a very alarming crack. There is a high pitched squeak noise followed by a pale blur moving past Nobody.</p>
    <p>Acris makes a concerned noise and darts towards the falling cryptid. Against all odds, he manages to deftly catch her before she hits the ground. Surprisingly enough, Acris is also strong enough to hold her up. Acris also learns that cryptid elves blush a grey-black color.</p>
    <p>“Um,” Shady mumbles, “Thanks…”</p>
    <p>“<small>I can’t take her anywhere…</small>” Eyeswith grumbles from somewhere up the tree. </p>
    <p>“...And that right there is why I don’t like climbing,” Cel says. </p>
    <p>Acris carefully sets his friend back on the ground and then runs his hand through his hair in what he hopes is a very suave heroic gesture.  It’s not.</p>
    <p>“Was nuthin,” he mumbles.</p>
    <p>Shady dusts herself off lightly and makes an awkward noise at Acris that may be some kind of acknowledgement. She then takes several steps back into the shade of the tree and just kind of… isn’t there.</p>
    <p>“<small>See?</small>” The cat comments. </p>
    <p>“<small>You’re telling me,</small>” Cel mutters, leaning cat-wards. “<small>He’s like this every time, I swear.</small>” She turns back to Acris. “So, we were making a map, right? We should probably get back to that. Give Shady a chance to recover herself or whatever.” </p>
    <p>It takes about twenty minutes.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>There is an entirely new branch of river to explore! It wasn’t even <i>on</i> the human map! Acris gets to be the first one to map it at <i>all</i>, and that is extremely exciting. The excitement levels, however, rapidly accelerate along with the water itself. The narrow stream becomes extremely difficult to navigate quickly, with Acris and Cel having to put their full attention and strength into paddling just to keep making headway upstream.</p>
    <p>As they slowly make progress along the rapids, they see a short cliff in the distance ahead of them along with the source of their woes: A short waterfall coming down about fifty or sixty feet into a basin that becomes this stream.</p>
    <p>With the exhaustion of having to push against so much water, Cel and Acris are forced to stop and beach the canoe on the shore to take a break. As the group is planning their next move, they spot something: A patch of gray smoke rising from what looks like a small ledge about halfway up the cliff face. </p>
    <p>Cel scrambles tiredly off of the boat. “We’re… going to have to row against the current to get back, aren’t we?” she says. </p>
    <p>Acris gives her a very curious look.</p>
    <p>“Non?  The water ain’t gon’ turn’t round t’spite us.  Rivers only flow one way, an et’s down.”</p>
    <p>She glances back at the aptly-named ‘crick’, and rubs a hand over her neck. “...I’ll take your word for it,” she says. </p>
    <p>Acris stands in the creek to hold the little boat steady for the other two elves to disembark. Shady disembarks, taking her cat and her satchel with her. She squints at the sun as Nobody very carefully extracts herself from the watercraft. </p>
    <p>Cel gestures to the line of smoke above them. “Think it might be a signal fire?” she says. “Maybe someone else tried to map this thing too, and got lost.”</p>
    <p>"Maybe they need help?" Shady asks quietly. </p>
    <p>“Mais,” Acris says thoughtfully, “What should we do, Cel?”</p>
    <p>Cel taps her chin. “Well, we’d be irresponsible if we just ignore ‘em, but there’s no reason they couldn’t also just be some-elf camping out. Or bandits, waiting to ambush anyone who spots their signal. Or a dragon who ate a bunch of charcoal this morning.” She glances over at Shady. “You’re pretty sneaky, right? I’ll head up there and take a look, as sneakily as I can, and since you’re even sneakier, you’ll be able to back me up and then get help if I’m spotted. Sound okay?”</p>
    <p>"Okay," Shady looks at the ground between the group and the cliff wall, a distance of several hundred yards, "I can do that. Maybe they should get a little closer…?"</p>
    <p>“We’ll be here to back yall up, won’t we, Nobody, weh?” Acris tries to reassure his friends.</p>
    <p>Nobody looks uncertain, but nods- she’s getting better at that- anyway.  “Of course.  However… hrm.  I would advise utmost caution, but I have a feeling that would be disregarded.  Instead, I advise moderate caution.” </p>
    <p>“Moderate caution,” Cel says, crouching into the brush around the riverbank. “My favorite. Ready Shady?”</p>
    <p>Shady nods quietly, though she definitely seems nervous.</p>
    <p>The two elves set off with, as promised, moderate caution. The ground is strewn with rocks and boulders, making a stealthy approach possible even in daylight. Cel stays low and moves carefully, trying to keep shifting gravel from giving her away. She sees Shady moving beside her, almost appearing and disappearing as she tries to stick to the shadows of the larger boulders.</p>
    <p>Cel lies prone and peeks around a rock once she is close enough. She can see the smoke billowing from a narrow ledge about fifty feet up. There is quite a bit of smoke, more than a normal campfire would produce. Cel squints. She can see a red bolt of cloth streaming from the ledge. There are shapes moving around the smoke. Cel struggles to make them out.</p>
    <p>She hears a slight scraping noise next to her. Shady is slowly trying to peek over the same rock Cel is hiding next to. Cel hears something, a slight buzzing noise. She glances back, the goes wide eyed and quietly kicks Shady's nearby leg.</p>
    <p>Shady gets the hint and drops flat just seconds before an insect-like shape buzzes over them. Cel gets a good look at the creature as it buzzes over them for a few moments.</p>
    <p>It's a grotesquely obese creature flying on fleshy wings with a long pointed speartip for a mouth. The creature resembles a fleshy mosquito the size of a housecat. Eventually, it loses interest and flies back up towards the smoke.</p>
    <p>Cel watches as it rejoins the other shapes darting around the smoke. She counts at least four total. As the smoke billows, she can just make out a winged humanoid figure pressed up against the cliffside, nearly collapsed with the smoke cloud between them and the creatures. Cel can't tell if the person is moving or not.</p>
    <p>"Stirges," Shady whispers to Cel, "Nasty bugs. What do we do?" </p>
    <p>“Smilisca talked about this,” Cel whispers back. “Blood drinkers, pretty weak, travel in groups. We’re not taking them out ourselves… but we might be able to if we gather up. Or at least distract them so that elf can get away.”</p>
    <p>She turns, and stares Shady in the eyes. “If you’ve got anything that will keep them off of that person for a few seconds, now’s the time. Otherwise, get back to Nobody and Acris as quick as you can. I’ll stay put, and if they make moves or the smoke starts to die… I’ll get their attention. You solid on this?”</p>
    <p>"I do have something," Shady looks at Cel, "But they have to come closer. Solid."</p>
    <p>Her voice is only a little shaky. </p>
    <p>Cel nods. “Is it something that can distract all of them, or just some in an area?”</p>
    <p>"Maybe all? Never tried it like this…" Shady looks back up at the cliff, "No time. I'll stay, go get the others. I'll distract if I have to. Hurry, okay?" </p>
    <p>The Fire Elf blinks. “No offense, Shady, but I’m way stabbier than you are.” She pauses. “But fine. First part of being a party is trust, so if you say you got it, I’ll believe you. Just… don’t get bit until we’re all here to back you up.”</p>
    <p>She pulls her training sword from her belt, sets it point-first in the ground beside Shady, and darts at top-speed towards the boat. As Cel turns to run, her new boots crunch onto the gravel. Shady hisses and ducks as Cel starts to jog noisily along the rocky ground.</p>
    <p>The stirges turn away from their elusive prey and spot a juicy fire elf jogging just below them. As a pack, all four stirges descend towards Cel. They swoop low, easily gaining on her.</p>
    <p>Shady jumps up from her hiding spot. She raises her arms and makes intricate gestures, hissing out the syllables to <span class="ShadyMagic">Hypnotism</span>. Strands of whispering shadow encircles the swarm of striges, weaving strange patterns all around them. The swarm slows to a stop… except for one, that ducks out of the enchantment and makes a straight line for the cryptid elf.</p>
    <p>“Cel!” Shady yells, “Cel I missed one, <i>help!</i>” </p>
    <p>Shady nabs the sword of the ground and scrambles back to stand next to Cel. She shoves the sword back into Cel’s hands without saying anything, her eyes focused on the creature swooping towards them.</p>
    <p>“I’m here,” Eyeswith says from her shoulder. Cel isn’t even sure if he was actually there the whole time. </p>
    <p>Cel looks at the Stirge -- now only three paces away -- then at Shady, and then at the training sword in her hand. She lets the sword drop from her fingers, and then darts forward, pulling her Lycan blade free from her belt and charging directly at the low-flying vampire-bug.</p>
    <p>The stirge dives downward, aiming its proboscis for her face. Cel grins.</p>
    <p>She twists into a Blade Elf countercharge stance, and shoves the blade hard upward, straight into the creature’s bloated middle. </p>
    <p>The stirge crumples, squealing and wiggling. Hot ichor leaks down the edge of the sword.</p>
    <p>Cel stares at it for a second, and then flicks it off the end of her sword and moves back into stance. At the sight of the violent destruction of one of its fellows, one of the three remaining stirges shakes free of the spell and begins to buzz angrily towards the teenagers. </p>
    <p>A little ways away from this scene of heroism, Nobody’s tiny ears perk.  Her expression turns sour.  She turns, and gives Acris a serious glance.</p>
    <p>“I do not believe that moderate caution was employed.”</p>
    <p>She then begins hustling towards the direction of the shout as fast as her stout frame will carry her.  Gander flaps awkwardly just behind. Just as Nobody catches up to Shady, the second stirge lunges at Cel.</p>
    <p>The stirge buzzes as the last strands of the hypnotic shadows whirl away from it. It flails its legs to try to grab at Cel, but she manages to bat it away with the flat of her sword. It buzzes angrily and reorients as it turns to face her.</p>
    <p>Acris hurry scurries as fast as his feet can plap to catch up to everyone else.  He seems to have been caught unaware. Shady glances at him as he plap plaps up. She wiggles her fingers, causing a few long shadow threads to appear between her fingers. She holds the spell where it is, carefully watching the fight between Cel and the stirge.</p>
    <p>“Only got one good spell left,” she whispers, “Gotta make it count…” </p>
    <p>Cel steps sideways, opposite the stirge’s spin, and then swings toward its back, catching the creature right at the base of the upper wings. It drops like a squishy rock. The woven enchantment starts to falter, and one more stirge breaks free, starting its approach towards Cel. </p>
    <p>Nobody watches Cel’s feats of martial prowess with an impressed expression.  Since it appears that Shady has come to no significant harm, she then moves to do the next best thing she can think of.  Walking to Cel’s side as the next Stirge approaches, she prepares to help however she can.</p>
    <p>This stirge is not dazed like the last one. It sees Cel, and it darts directly at her in a furious buzz. Cel tries to pivot and raise her sword. Nobody tries to put her arm between Cel and the mad creature, but it claws past her and over her shoulder. The stirge leaps forward and latches onto Cel’s face, rears back its proboscis… and stops. Threads of shadow wrap around it.</p>
    <p>“<span class="ShadyMagic">Cause Fear!</span>” Shady hisses at the creature as dark energy whirls around the creature. It stops inches from Cel’s face, makes a high pitched shrieking noise, and immediately takes flight and flees back towards its hypnotized companion. The sudden noise jolts the last stirge out of its trance. </p>
    <p>Acris finally catches up to everyone else.  Panting, and out of breath, he hastily barks out a “<span class="AcrisMagic">Magic Missile</span>” at the stirge that has just stopped being hypnotized.  He’s assuming that this will prevent it from getting its bearings to attack them. Just as the creature shakes off its hypnosis, a small bolt of magic energy catches it quite neatly between the eyes. It falls to the ground with a decidedly sad plop. </p>
    <p>Cel swallows, trying very hard to push away the terrified grimace clinging to her face. Her eyes follow the last stirge. She squares her shoulders, and charges, swinging her sword in an arc straight for its belly. </p>
    <p>It bobs at the last second; the steel nicks off the bottom half of a leg. </p>
    <p>Nobody follows Cel’s headlong rush with a more sedate canter.  Once next to the buzzing creature, she watches its movements, ready to push it away at any sign of lunging. The panicked creature does not lunge towards anyone, instead it tries to veer away from Cel. It bumps into Nobody, who rather forcefully swats the creature away. It buzzes helplessly directly in front of Cel as she brings her sword up again. </p>
    <p>Cel swings her shortsword hard into the stirge’s side, cutting it right out of the sky. </p>
    <p>The body drops. </p>
    <p>Cel wipes some moisture from around her eyes. “That…,” she puffs. “That was my bad. I’m sorry, Nobody. We were being cautious, and I… was a little too confident on how sneaky I was.” </p>
    <p>“Is everyone okay, weh?” Acris asks, still kind of winded from his jog.</p>
    <p>“I-I’m okay,” Shady finally lowers her hands, “Cel?” </p>
    <p>“I’m fine,” Cel says, forcing the rest of the grimace off her face. “Just got a little close to my face for a second.” She smiles. “Now, we’ve got more important things to worry about -- there’s whoever was hiding from them in the smoke. We’ve gotta rescue them.” </p>
    <p>Nobody completes her own assessment of everyone’s health, and seems to be satisfied.  She simply nods in agreement.</p>
    <p>The group reaches the cliff just as whatever the source of the smoke was expires. As the last few wisps of smoke blow away, a severely emaciated winged elf looks out from over the ledge. What the winged elf courier does next could not even generously be described as “flying” but is at least a few steps removed from “falling.”</p>
    <p>Nobody and Acris both immediately rush forward to try to catch the descending elf, but immediately bump into each other awkwardly. Thankfully Cel is more ready for this. She isn’t quite strong enough to carry the winged elf, but is able to guide her to the ground uninjured.</p>
    <p>The courier is in rough shape. She pants for breath. Her skin is flushed pale and she bears several obvious deep puncture wounds from the stirges. She is currently unable to stand, and has to pant for several seconds before rasping out a request for water. </p>
    <p>Nobody’s brow crinkles in concern again.  She motions for Cel to bring forth her waterskin, while she examines the wounds, looking less for damage (which is obvious) than for signs of infection (which is what will actually endanger the courier). </p>
    <p>What she finds is not promising.  Intercession is definitely required.  She looks into the courier’s eyes.  </p>
    <p>“Endure.  I do not think it is your time yet.”</p>
    <p>Bedside manner deployed, she then rests her palm against the densest concentration of punctures before channeling the life force of The World into the Courier’s form.  “<span class="NobodyMagic">Cure Wounds, Lightly</span>.” </p>
    <p>The wounds themselves are small. They close easily enough. With no infections, the immediate danger passes. Acris presses a canteen into the courier’s hands. She drinks carefully, then catches her breath. With the painful wounds closed and precious water in her, she is able to speak.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” her voice is still dry, “My name’s Aeryndelyn. Those things jumped me when I stopped for water. I tried to get away, but they hit me in the air… I only got halfway up the cliff. Been burning… everything. Smoke kept them away. I was running out… they would have killed me. Thank you so much.” </p>
    <p>“Happy to help,” Cel says, keeping her forced grin up. “How long were you stuck there?” </p>
    <p>“Not sure,” Aeryn takes a drink, “A day, maybe. It got dark. If you hadn’t come…” she shudders. </p>
    <p>“We’re not far from the rafts we came on,” Cel says. “We can get you back there to rest.”</p>
    <p>“Back… where?” the courier asks. </p>
    <p>“Partager!” Acris answers helpfully.  “It tain’t far!  We ken definitely git you there.”</p>
    <p>“There’s a flotilla nearby?” the winged elf perks up a little bit, “Yes! That would be… that would be wonderful.” </p>
    <p>“Are you done with your maps, Acris?” Cel says, glancing back to him, and then to Shady. </p>
    <p>“Weh.  We have enough.  We don’t gotta get the whole thing in one go anyway.”  Acris fishes the braided cord out of his pocket to show what’s finished.  “This’s more important than any old map.”</p>
    <p>The winged elf slowly takes help to stand up. She manages a smile.</p>
    <p>“Thank the three of you so much,” she manages to say.</p>
    <p>Shady is nowhere to be seen. </p>
    <p>“There are more than three,” Nobody says plainly “but I do not think excessive thanks is necessary.” She quirks an eyebrow at Acris, making sure such humility is appropriate.</p>
    <p>Acris offers the winged elf some snacks from their stash.  Might as well eat it now.</p>
    <p>He leads the way back toward the beached canoe, hoping that it will be able to hold all five of them.  Maybe if they dump the camping supplies?  He’s lost in thought.</p>
    <p>It will be snug. Someone will have to hold the bag of camping supplies in their lap and it will be a little comfy, but it will be safe enough. One member of the party, however, will not be able to stay hidden. </p>
    <p>As Acris adjusts the canoe, he feels a tap on his shoulder. Shady is standing next to him, with him between her and the courier.</p>
    <p>"Hi," Shady says quietly.</p>
    <p>"Oh?" Aeryn blinks, "A… crytid elf? <i>And</i> a crag elf? That's… huh. You helped save me too?"</p>
    <p>Shady nods quietly.</p>
    <p>"Well, thank you too." Aeryn says. </p>
    <p>Cel waits for Aeryn and the others to head towards the boat, and then quietly cuffs Shady on the shoulder. “Thanks for saving my face,” she says quietly. “I kind of need that for things.”</p>
    <p>"Um," Shady searches for words for a few seconds, "So… I can be in your party?" </p>
    <p>Cel grins. “Well… I dunno… we’ve already got a Rupert, and Acris Ruperts enough for any one group…” She pauses. “Of course you can, Shady. Hells, you already are -- you just kicked the butts of some enormous rat-mosquitoes, and saved someone’s life. That’s more than enough for you to be in. And way more than we put the duck through before we let him join.”</p>
    <p>"It's a goose…" Shady says. Though she tries, she cannot suppress the small smile or the very slight perk to her ears at Cel's words, "Thanks…" </p>
    <p>“Call him a duck. He knows what he did.”  </p>
    <p>Shady glances behind Cel. She is met with cold, unblinking avian eyes. The fowl betrays nothing.</p>
    <p>"Oh.. kay…" Shady notes. </p>
    <p>“Anyway, we should probably get moving before the Mother Stirge shows up with reinforcements or something,” Cel says, tying her training sword back onto her belt. She kick-grabs one of the oars, steps up beside the boat, and glances back at Acris. “Ready to ship out, Captain Wizard?” </p>
    <p>Acris gives Cel his brightest dorky grin.</p>
    <p>“Weh, yes ma’am Colonel Elderbrand!”  The apprentice holds the canoe steady in the swiftly moving stream for everyone to pile back inside for the downstream journey.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>There are four extra hammocks hanging in the Hylidae family raft now. For the first time in many years, it's starting to feel as full as it should. Though they aren't river elves, they are as much family as anyone else who has ever lived here.</p>
    <p>Even Shady hangs a hammock. She doesn't sleep, but she is quiet, patient, and needs no light. She spends the extra time studying or working on her sewing projects while Eyeswith sleeps next to her. Acris was right. It is nice.</p>
    <p>It's a very subtle difference, but staying in a room full of friends is much preferable to hiding.</p>
    <p>Shady is still getting used to using that word, even in her head. It's a new experience for her, but one that is very welcome.</p>
