    <h1>A Second Chance</h1>
    <p>Bryti is alive. It took Litoria and Allophryne hours to extract her from the vicious fishhook-like silver barbs in the net the wolf elves had captured her with. She was unconscious, knocked out by some kind of powerful poison that neither Litoria or the medics could get rid of. Litoria had pulled out many fish hooks in her life, but doing it through bloody wet fur on a wolf tested her nerves to their absolute limit. She had to step back several times and remind herself that this was Bryti until her battered hands stopped shaking.</p>
    <p>About a day has passed since they had rescued her. Allophryne had cured the wounds left by the hooks, but the poison had remained. Bryti is strong, to say the least. She will likely recover sooner or later. Litoria doesn’t want to take any chances on that. She had placed the wolf carefully on Sauver’s back with her. She holds her in place as they travel back to Winter Quarters. As a new day dawns, Litoria has been able to prepare the few spells she has. One of those spells is <i>Neutralize Poison.</i> She carefully casts the spell and touches the wolf.</p>
    <p>Bryti stirs. Her eyes blink lazily then snap open wide. She raises her head with a bleary growl, but then looks around. The growl sputters out when she sees Litoria. The wolf makes a huffing noise and an expression that Litoria can’t read. Suddenly, Bryti drops her head back down directly into Litoria’s lap. The wolf closes her eyes and her ears flatten sideways. </p>
    <p>Sauver is not a narrow mount, but holding a wolf onto the not-precisely-level surface of her back is a tricky process.  Litoria has spent a long time trying to keep the wolf from slipping off and collapsing limply onto the ground.  Theoretically, this should be easier to do with a conscious person than a poisoned wolf.</p>
    <p>It’s not really.</p>
    <p>“You don’t have to talk to me,” she tells the still injured werewolf, “mais, you’re gon’ fall off if’n you’re not careful with them paws.”  She keeps a steady hold on the wolf’s shoulders.</p>
    <p>The wolf slowly raises her head. She adjusts slightly, then shifts. Bryti takes her elven form slower than Litoria is used to seeing. She moves to a familiar position riding Sauver, but is sitting in front. She looks forward, where Litoria isn’t able to see her face.</p>
    <p>“You came,” she says quietly.</p>
    <p>“Weh.”</p>
    <p>It's a long, quiet ride back to Winter Quarters. Litoria does not try to force the werewolf to talk to her. It wouldn't be right, or fair, or just to abuse the opportunity for closeness to press any issues right now. She knows better than that.</p>
    <p>Inside the perimeter of the secret home base of all continental river elves, it’s not too long a trek to get to the central military headquarters.  They arrive just before true dark falls, while their vision is still fairly clear in the last failing moments of daylight.  Litoria steers her hippopotamus through the military camp without comment.</p>
    <p>Elves that would normally be crowding about to greet the triumphant wolf are instead distracted by the arrival of a full unit’s worth of domesticated riding wolves.  The Archerfish and Crocodilians bringing them into the settlement have a lot of work on their hands to keep the excitable dogs from causing too much of a scene.  Litoria is able to quietly slip Sauver through the commotion and arrive safely at her office without notice.</p>
    <p>The office is a roughly octagonal building, set on top of the exposed roots of a pair of enormous mangrove trees.  It uses the roots as stilts and a beam between the trunks forms the central support for its roof.  A porch wraps around the entire structure, and there is space between the roots with enough room for Sauver to turn around.</p>
    <p>Litoria stops her mount at the steps.</p>
    <p>“You can stay here.”</p>
    <p>Bryti slowly dismounts Sauver and looks at the structure. She takes a couple steps forward, then leans against one of the exposed roots. She lowers her head slightly.</p>
    <p>“This is the place you told me about,” she says, “The place you said I could come to when I wanted.” </p>
    <p>Litoria nudges Sauver backward, not wanting to be in the way.</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  She looks up at the little building between the trees.  “It still is.”</p>
    <p>Bryti slumps a little bit, then looks back at Litoria. She notes that Litoria has not dismounted. A look of worry crosses her face.</p>
    <p>“Litoria…” she struggles for words momentarily, “I… I know you likely do not wish to see me right now, but… I don’t want to be alone right now. Could you stay? Just… for a little while.” </p>
    <p>The Warmaster’s back stiffens at the request.  She is absolutely terrified that she’ll say the wrong thing <i>again</i> and make everything worse <i>again</i>.</p>
    <p>“Weh.  Of course I can do that for you.”  She slides off of her hippopotamus, and stops to remove the heavy plates of armor.  Sauver has finally grown into her previous mount’s war gear.  It’s hard not to think about the fortunate timing, with Wolf Elves at the door.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” Bryti exhales, then gently touches Sauver’s side, “Thank you too, Sauver.”</p>
    <p>The hippo makes a slight happy wiggle. Bryti lowers her hand, then takes a step back. She turns and wearily makes her way up the porch stairs and to the door.</p>
    <p>And this building does, indeed, have a door, which is a fair bit unusual for river elf construction.  Litoria doesn’t come right out and say it, but this was initially done so that the blade elf would feel more at home while she’s visiting.  It was a design feature.  The first of several such choices.</p>
    <p>Inside the roughly octagonal building there is only one room.  It’s fairly sparse with decorations, only one alligator-skin rug on the floor.  A map hangs on one of the walls, with several flags tacked onto it with small nails.  Below the map is a sand table, set up to diagram a possible combat scenario with small markers for different units.  As is normal for river elf furnishings, the table is low, and there are no chairs.  A pair of wide planks lean against the wall near the sand table.</p>
    <p>On the opposite side of the room a curtain provides some small amount of privacy for a low bed.  Not a hammock, but a framed bed with an actual moss-stuffed mattress.  Neatly folded blankets sit on top of it, and a squat little stove sits nearby.  Someone has helpfully already lit the stove, and a small stack of fuel sits next to it.  The room is warm, and somewhat welcoming.</p>
    <p>Litoria follows Bryti inside, and places her spear in a purpose-built rack next to the door. Bryti stares at the room with surprise for a moment before unshouldering her sword and placing it in the rack as well. She steps forward, looking at the map and table. She gives it a very long look before speaking.</p>
    <p>“How many?” her voice sounds very unsteady.</p>
    <p>“Not one of ours,” Litoria answers, intuiting the intent of the question.  “Fourteen of Terror’s.  Non, them Crag didn’t give us a count, mais I’d estimate near 20-30 of ‘em.  None got in direct contac’ wi’ them werebats.  No Afflicted.”</p>
    <p>“Crag?” Bryti sounds surprised momentarily.</p>
    <p>She looks at the map again, then suddenly sits down on the floor heavily. She brings her hands up to her face. There are tears running down her face.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, I…” she stops, then starts again, “Why? Why am <i>I</i> so damned important that people I’ve never met die to save me? It’s… it’s not right. It doesn’t make any sense. I don’t want that…”</p>
    <p>Litoria walks to the map and points at a location on it, just south of the area labeled Crag probably and on the northern shore of the sea.</p>
    <p>“We been tryin’ to pin down where th’ Wolf Elves live for long ‘nuff.”  The Warmaster traces the distance between that spot and their current, highly secret, unlabeled even on this map, location.  “Terror migh’ actually <i>thank</i> you fer gettin’ snagged if’n one of them she took prisoner gives up that location, weh.”</p>
    <p>She looks at the werewolf on the floor.</p>
    <p>“I know it don’t feel like it, mais, it were some luck to finally git th’ drop on them for once.”  She looks down at the scenario in the sand, and considers the changes that need to be made to the tactical scene it models based on the behavior of the combatants faced earlier in the week.  “You done saved us all once, a’course we want to return the favor.”</p>
    <p>“I was only-” Bryti cuts herself off before finishing that familiar sentence. She raises her head slightly and takes another heavy breath.</p>
    <p>“I thought I was dead,” she says quietly, “They snagged me with that damned net, dragged me until I was exhausted, then hit me with that poison. Everything started going dark, and I thought… that was it. I didn’t think I would wake up again. I… with everything I was told, I <i>hoped</i> I wouldn’t wake up again. Then everything went black and I…”</p>
    <p>She bites down that sentence, unable to continue. </p>
    <p id="return">Litoria doesn’t react immediately.  <a href="25_A Grim Swamp.php">There is a lot to think about.</a>  She then carefully places the boards over the sand table, leaving its hypothetical alone.</p>
    <p>She quietly walks to the bed and picks up one of its soft blankets.</p>
    <p>Returning to the werewolf on her office floor, she gently drapes the soft linen blanket across Bryti’s shoulders before sitting down on the floor facing her.</p>
    <p>The river elf waits a moment for her guest to warm up before offering her a hand to hold. Bryti looks up at Litoria's hand. She sits very still for several moments. Slowly, gingerly, she reaches out and touches Litoria's hand. She runs her fingers along her skin and stops as she sees the dozens of tiny half-healed cuts that cover it.</p>
    <p>"The net," she says as she looks up at Litoria, "But I was…"</p>
    <p>Litoria shrugs.</p>
    <p>"My problem t' deal with."  She turns away, embarrassed.  "It couldn't wait."</p>
    <p>Litoria has barely finished saying those words before she feels Bryti’s finger trace a pattern on her hand. Cool magic hums in her palm and Litoria feels the tiny cuts heal. Bryti pauses, then gently places her hand in Litoria’s. Bryti does not speak for a few minutes. When she finally does, she speaks in Sylvan.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
    <p>Litoria does not respond.  There's nothing she can think to say that would make things better, so she opts to say nothing at all.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you,” Bryti continues, “I’m sorry I see the worst outcome in everything,  that I refuse to allow myself to be happy, that I push people away who genuinely want to help me, that I <i>hate</i> myself so damned much, that I refuse to believe that I can have a future, that I… I…”</p>
    <p>Bryti closes her eyes as tears run down her face.</p>
    <p>“I have been a terrible fool, and ruined what we had because of it. I’m sorry.”</p>
    <p>“You don’t have to be sorry,” Litoria answers in fluid Sylvan.  “You were right.  I was taking you for granted, thinking that you’d want to come with me or you’d wait for me to get back.  It isn’t fair to you to make those assumptions, no?”</p>
    <p>Litoria squeezes the werewolf’s hand in hers gently.</p>
    <p>“You’re just one person.  You shouldn’t be expected to fix everything.”</p>
    <p>Bryti squeezes back gently.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what to do,” she confesses, “I thought I knew where… where the end would be, but now everything has changed. There is so much happening, I am somehow tied to it, there are so many people who <i>believe</i> in me, but I don’t… I don’t know where I belong, I don’t know what’s going to happen, I don’t know what I need to do, and I- I am afraid of what the future might bring. Of how I might fail you. Of how I might <i>dare</i> to hope to have a home again, and then… and then ruin it all again.” </p>
    <p>“You don’t have to choose today.”  Litoria glances briefly back at the map on the wall.  “I’m not,” she swallows her remorse.  “I’m not going anywhere.”</p>
    <p>“What?” Bryti opens her eyes again and looks back at Litoria, “I thought you said… I thought you said you had to return home.” </p>
    <p>“Weh...” Litoria looks at the rough floor to hide her expression.  “And I was wrong.”</p>
    <p>She flexes newly healed fingers, failing to distract herself with the marvel of how they don’t even sting anymore.</p>
    <p>“I don’t expect forgiveness, non.”</p>
    <p>“Litoria, if there were anything, <i>anything</i> left of my home,” Bryti puts both of her hands on Litoria’s, “I would have done exactly the same thing. The other river elves, though… they need you. What are you going to do?” </p>
    <p>“Mais, that’s the thing.”  Litoria sits up straighter.  “Even if there’s something to go back to, it’s the people who matter, and the people who need us are here.  I’m not gon’ say that none of us are leaving - can’t know that answer yet - but Partager and Envoyer will be here.  And so will the military.”</p>
    <p>Litoria inhales sharply, preparing herself for something she’d been rehearsing in her head for weeks, just in case she had to explain herself to Smilisca.</p>
    <p>“The Crag and the Cryptids don’t know the first thing about dealing with their fellow elves.  Those in Surt need to feel important, and have an audience for their theatrics.  The Blade elves in Alfyr are still fumbling their way toward reclaiming an elven culture.  The Dark elves are too shy to come out on their own.  And everyone south of the Goldfall is too naive to handle the complexity of the threat the Wolf Elves pose as it requires.”</p>
    <p>She pauses to rub a webbed hand over her face with exhaustion.</p>
    <p>“The treaty gave our old home to the halflings.  No matter what’s there now, the important thing is that it’s just a place.  We only stop moving when we’re dead, and our people are here.”</p>
    <p>“You forgot one,” Bryti says with a very slight smile, “There’s a foolish werewolf who refuses to believe she has a home, no matter how many times you try to tell her.” </p>
    <p>Litoria rubs her eyes with the back of one hand.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t think you’d want to see me again.”</p>
    <p>“Why not? We kill what we bite,” Bryti pauses, “And… I am thoroughly bitten.”</p>
    <p>Litoria blushes a deep shade of green.</p>
    <p>“You ah,” she pauses to push the hair out of her eyes, “You should have heard me try an’ explain that idea to a teenager last Summer.  Mais, non.  Finish what you start.  Can we start again?”</p>
    <p>“I…” Bryti struggles for words momentarily before deciding on a simple “Yes.” </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Litoria wakes up. Her body tenses. Cold adrenaline shocks through her veins. Someone has grabbed her. An arm is wrapped around her neck. She is under attack. Violence flashes through her mind. Her arm darts towards for her spear, its position a practiced memory. She grabs nothing but air.</p>
    <p>Bryti grumbles something in her sleep. Litoria's eyes open. Her heart is pounding in her chest. Slowly, her awareness comes to her. She's not in danger. The skin that touches hers feels familiar. The arm draped over her does not belong to an enemy… but it does belong to a werewolf. As the surge of adrenaline fades, Litoria returns to the present.</p>
    <p>She is in the bed in her office. Bryti is with her, one arm draped over Litoria's chest and her head resting on her shoulder. The stove has burned down to coals, giving only a little heat and dim red light. Bryti's skin feels warm, even through the linen night clothes they are wearing. Only one arm is cold, pushed out from under the blanket to search for a weapon. Bryti is still asleep.</p>
    <p>Litoria controls her breathing. Her heart slows and returns to normal. She slowly pulls her heavily scarred arm back under the blanket and wraps it around Bryti's waist, where it had been before. Bryti is warm. Litoria's hand does not tremble.</p>
    <p>She only stays awake long enough to make certain that this is not a dream.</p>
