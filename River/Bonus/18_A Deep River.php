    <h1>A Deep River</h1>
    <p>Every night Smilisca sits by the side of his hammock and lights a stick of incense.  As the thick smoke coils away from the thin reed it burns from, the wizard sings his list of names.  The list is a long one.  It includes all the Navigators before him and all the Oarsmen who fell with their hippopotamuses in the slaughter of the Werebeaver Skati, the exodus across the continental divide, and in the war itself.  If he could include every fallen elf he would.</p>
    <p>Instead Smilisca names the names he knows and hopes and prays that the ones he does not know will not find offense at being left off of his list.  He swore to forget none of them.  They are his honored ancestors.  They are the precedents for his craft and skill.  Without those that came before he would not be a wizard, and would not have survived as long as he has.</p>
    <p>He sings the same list, the same way, at the same cadence each and every night that passes.  Some of Eina’s assistant clerics have warned him about the suspicion of heresy in putting so many deceased elves ahead of Calestros in his worshipful thoughts.  Smilisca has discussed it with Eina though, and she does not think it a harm if it helps him lay his nightmares of hauntings to rest.</p>
    <p>In early Springtime, Partager moves out on the Burning Wolf River.  Smilisca has already said his goodbyes to his cousin as she departed with Arpenter, and wished farewell to Eina as she rode away with Envoyer.  He’s relocated his apprentice’s new fire elf friend through some careful dimension hopping spells so that she would not learn the location of Winter Quarters.  And now they’re out on the river themselves, passing days on the move and nights in the peace of deep water.</p>
    <p>Tonight he sings the lists of the dear sainted departed and has accompaniment from his neighbor’s fiddle and an accordion upstream.</p>
    <p>Uncharacteristically, Acris stays awake studying.  This fire elf has been a good influence.  Trying to live up to her expectations of him has made Acris actually put more effort into actually understanding his lessons than before.  He’s stopped attempting to take shortcuts.  Smilisca appreciates this new and improved apprentice.  He thanks the ancestors for the patience to have seen this change through.</p>
    <p>As Smilisca’s mournful song reaches a conclusion, he becomes aware of a tall figure nearby. Ink is sitting on a log a couple dozen feet down the shore from the raft. He sits quietly, watching Smilisca with a strange look on his face. Once Smilisca’s song has finished and he has been noticed, he says “Hello.”</p>
    <p>Smilisca inhales the thick incense smoke and exhales out the peace of the night.  Emotionally drained already, he faces the better wizard.</p>
    <p>“Bienvenu,” Smilisca greets Ink formally, standing from his ash-strewn spot on the raft.  He gestures toward the cryptid elf to welcome him aboard the raft.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” Ink intones as he stands and steps aboard the raft. He looks over the ash from the incense for a few moments, then stares at Smilisca for a few moments before speaking.</p>
    <p>“Can we talk?” he asks carefully, “Our trade.”</p>
    <p>Acris edges further and further away from the overly tall elf on board his home raft.  He’d kept his nerve when his home was invaded by werewolves, but this giant is another matter entirely.  Cel might as well be dead, she sleeps so soundly in her hammock with its fire resistant woolen cords.</p>
    <p>Smilisca gives the young elves a measured glance.  And then he nods, and leads Ink around the porch to the bow of the raft.  This was not what he had in mind when he prepared the spell this morning, but he goes ahead and speaks the arcane words to cast a spell of silence around the two wizards.</p>
    <p>“This’s as private as I can make it, weh.  <span class="tooltip">Allons.<span class="tooltiptext">Let's go</span></span>”</p>
    <p>“Good,” Ink nods as he completes the spell.</p>
    <p>The strange wizard contemplates for a few moments before speaking, “I would like to know about your… magic. Tradition. Talent… History?”</p>
    <p>“Mais which is it then?”  Smilisca asks, still feeling the overwhelming tranquility of ritual that currently prevents him from actually acting in anger.  “Y’want how I done learned it, what it is, or how uh - <i>talented</i> - I am, me?”  His stress on the word ‘talented’ displays mild confusion.</p>
    <p>“Hrm,” Ink rubs his chin, “Yes, but…”</p>
    <p>He pauses, gathering his thoughts for a moment before speaking, “I need help.”</p>
    <p>“Wi’ what?”</p>
    <p>“Our… secret,” Ink gives Smilisca a gauging look, “Have tried to solve it alone… failed. I do not know what to do. Need help.”</p>
    <p>The cryptid sounds surprisingly sad as he speaks, “Need… help. Perspective. Views of magic, of… solutions that I have not considered. You… practice magic. Are trusted with the secrets of a people. You… navigate.” Ink seems to be struggling to make sense. </p>
    <p>“Weh, I navigate.”  Smilisca looks behind himself to the thick braided rope in its many colors hanging from the peg behind them.  “I’ll help yall if’n I can, weh.  Mais, you gots to tell me what exactly I’m sup’post to be helpin’ wi.  Ain’t gon’ be a use otherwise.”</p>
    <p>Ink makes a rattling sound that it takes a moment for Smilisca to realize is a chuckle, “Yes. Can’t just tell people, ‘have huge dark secret that could kill us, how do we fix it?’ and say nothing else, expect results. That would be… stupid.”</p>
    <p>“Weh, guess so.”  Smilisca smiles slowly in response.  “So what’s this secret’s got you all honte ‘bout needin’ a navigator to git it fixed?”</p>
    <p>“Not ready to tell yet,” he says, “But… soon. It is… hm…”</p>
    <p>He stops for a few moments again, gathering his thoughts, “You know secrets. Secrets that need hiding, to keep people safe. You protect those, for your people. We have a secret, immense. If discovered… would be our end, but, can’t just… hide. Same as you, we must… hrm… keep moving, or disappear. Need a way to keep our secret, for good, but no secret so large keeps forever. Need… to find a way to change the rules. Need people who think in different ways, have different talents. Will be asking others. When I have enough, enough… perspectives on magic, will call them together… and then you will learn. If… you want to help.”</p>
    <p>Smilisca doesn’t really have to think about the answer to the actual question.  Which is good, because he’s studiously trying not to think about any of the actual secrets he’s currently in the process of keeping.  Some elves can read minds.</p>
    <p>“Weh, cousin, you ken count on me.”  Definitely not thinking of Winter Quarter’s exact geographical coordinates right now.  “Mais, if’n you don’t mind, jus’ send a message instead ‘a showin’ up real surprise like.  Jus’ pretend you can’t always know where we are.  If’n you’re gon’ ask for your secrets to be kept, please respect ours, weh.”</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Ink pauses a few moments, “I will stop watching, if you ask.” </p>
    <p>Smilisca takes off his hat to scratch his head.</p>
    <p>“Whelp.  That’s <span class="tooltip">honte.<span class="tooltiptext">Embarrassing</span></span>”  There’s a long pause as neither wizard makes any sort of sudden movement.  “Weh.  You, um, do that.”</p>
    <p>Ink nods in reply, “Don’t be,” he speaks plainly, “I watch everyone.”</p>
