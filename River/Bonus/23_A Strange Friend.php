    <h1>A Strange Friend</h1>
    <p>No one ever really talks about just how much work goes into becoming a wizard. All the stories talk about bending reality to your will and wielding impossible power, but they don’t mention how much math and memorization goes into doing that. Acris is no exception. Smilisca is a good teacher, and like any good teacher he will not let Acris forget to do the groundwork just because he’s successfully used a spell or two.</p>
    <p>That’s why Acris is up late working on his spell tables. Smilisca left in a hurry for, well, something or other. <i>Really</i> a hurry. Eina had told him that it involved saving their Wolf. Acris hopes he’s successful. She’s nice.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, Acris still had an apprentice’s work to do. Smilisca would no doubt be asking him to write out his basic spell tables from memory in a few weeks. It would be best to be prepared. Acris moves to dip his quill into the inkwell… and it thunks on the desk.</p>
    <p>Acris blinks and looks up. He swears he had put the inkwell on the right side of the desk, not the left. Strange. He reaches over and moves the inkwell back to the right, then dips his quill and looks back to his page.</p>
    <p>The page is now upside down. Acris makes a confused noise. From somewhere nearby, he hears a faint sound that might be a giggle. Acris has no idea what’s going on, but he assumes that the raft must be haunted or something.  And that means he needs to find someone who knows their way around ghosts.  Which means talking to Miss Eina.  Which also means not getting work done for who-knows-how-long while she attempts to speak with spirits long gone.</p>
    <p>It would clearly be better to just relocate to Places Unhaunted and ask Master Nonc to move the raft when he gets home.  That’s much simpler.</p>
    <p>Acris attempts to collect his notes and writing materials. As he scrambles to get his materials together, a shadow passes in front of him. He looks up to see a figure standing in front of his desk made of shadowy darkness, nearly reaching the ceiling. Slowly, the shadowy figure reaches out an arm for Acris. </p>
    <p>Reflexively, Acris hurls his bottle of ink at the shadowy figure, and the bottle sails through the middle of the horrifying form. Instantly, the form breaks up into four smaller balls of darkness that swirl around the room briefly. The dark blobs then swiftly float past Acris and reform into the shadowy figure directly behind him. </p>
    <p>Acris ducks under the table and pulls his notes down with him.</p>
    <p>“I dunno what you are or what you’re doin’,” his shout is muffled by being scant inches off the floor under the low table, “mais I gon’ spell you flat if’n you don’ git gone, weh!”</p>
    <p>“Really?” a voice whispers from right beside him, “What spells?”</p>
    <p>Acris looks over to see black eyes peeking through black hair. There is an elf crouched right next to him. The long ears and eerily long limbs are enough to tell him that it’s a cryptid elf, somehow folded up enough to fit under the table. </p>
    <p>“I done thought I’d start wi’ a <i>Ray of Frost</i> an’ move up to-OH NON <i>NON <b>NON!</b></i>” Acris panic flails and rolls out of the cryptid’s considerable reach before actually casting his handy-dandy <span class="AcrisMagic">Drench</span> on the way across the room.  The noises he emits while pinned against the wall by his own fear are not particularly impressive ones.</p>
    <p>There is a brief high pitched noise from under the desk, which clatters and sends his writing tools scattering. There is some kind of catlike hiss from under the desk and a black shape bolts out from under it and streaks across the room opposite Acris.</p>
    <p>“Ew! Gross! Water! Yuck! Ech! Ew!” The black shape stops running and as it skids to a halt is slightly more recognizable as a cat. It begins to lick its fur, then looks up at Acris.</p>
    <p>“What?” The cat asks.</p>
    <p>There is another scraping sound from under the desk and the soaking wet cryptid flops out from under it. Briefly, Acris thinks it is convulsing but then he realizes it is laughing. It’s shorter than most cryptids, and he thinks it might be a girl. Maybe. Not that he’s y’know staring or anything. </p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Quoi?<span class="tooltiptext">What?</span></span>” Acris gestures at the cat with both hands. “<i>Quoi?</i>” he repeats the gesture at the cryptid.  “<i><b>Quoi?</b></i>” he repeats, for emphasis, just in case the intruders in his home missed it the first two times.</p>
    <p>The cryptid is lost to giggle fits, despite her sogginess. The cat rolls its eyes just a little bit and finishes its preening. It flicks its tail a little bit and sighs.</p>
    <p>“Look,” he explains, “She has a weird sense of humor.”</p>
    <p>“Drench!” she manages through the strange laughter, “<i>Drench!</i>"</p>
    <p>"What's wrong with Drench?" Acris asks, indignant, "It's a perfectly good spell, weh- non I ain't arguin wi' no spies.  Git gone a'fore I spell you more!"</p>
    <p>“Now now,” the cat attempts to make a placating gesture with its paws, “Everything has been-”</p>
    <p>“Not a spy,” the cryptid’s giggle fit subsides a bit, “Runaway!” </p>
    <p>Acris sighs.</p>
    <p>"<i>Another one?</i>"  He slumps down on the floor of the raft in a heap of pudgy elf and Wizard<sup>tm</sup> robes.</p>
    <p>"Non.  That's jus yer cover story."  He shakes his head with determination.  "I hert about your type bein' all sneak sneak.  You know about Nobody an' you're using her t' try'n make me think her harmless when you clearly ain't.  Non, yer a spy en I gon' hafta capture ya fer Miss Rulyrana, weh!"  Unfortunately, Acris does not appear to have much actual desire to fight the cryptid.</p>
    <p>The cryptid is still laying in a wet heap sprawled out halfway out from under the table. She blinks at him slowly, then bursts out laughing again.</p>
    <p>“What she <i>should be saying,</i>” the cat clears his throat, “Is that miss Eina gave her permission for us to be at Winter Quarters, and she said we should go meet you and help you with your chores, not <i>play pranks…</i>”</p>
    <p>“Technically,” the cryptid holds up a finger to the cat, “We’re meeting.” </p>
    <p>“<i>A likely story...</i>” Acris looks between the cryptid and the most uncatlike cat.  “So prove it.  Mais how ken I trust you ain’t a spy?”</p>
    <p>"Oooh," the cryptid pulls herself out from under the table and rolls back up to standing, "Tough one. Hmmm. Lemme think."</p>
    <p>"We could just <i>go ask miss-</i>" The cat starts.</p>
    <p>"Shhh," The cryptid shushes him. He falls silent with a glum look.</p>
    <p>The cryptid glances at her soggy silk wrap dress. To Acris' surprise, she makes a quick hand gesture and whispers a few syllables to cast <span class="ShadyMagic">Prestidigitation</span>. Shady strings of shadow roll from her fingers as she slowly dries herself off. </p>
    <p>Acris recognizes the spell as a very useful one!  And his eyes trace the distance from the assumed-safe under-table space to the splattered mess of ink on the far wall.  At least the little jar didn’t break.  But the black splotch of horrible inky mess drips down the wall slowly.</p>
    <p>“So uh...” he starts, awkwardly, “Ken you git that while yer at it, weh?”</p>
    <p>"Huh?" She asks, then looks at the wall, "Oh. Sure."</p>
    <p>Once she's cleaned herself, she keeps the spell up and walks across the room. She carefully picks up the fallen inkpot and cleans it, along with the stains. Once she's done, she moves back and sets it on the table. Still holding the spell, she puts a hand on her hip.</p>
    <p>"There. Spy wouldn't do that."</p>
    <p>“Non,” Acris disagrees, “Only a real <i>elite most excellent spy</i> could do magic.  An usin’ magic to erase evidence is for shore a real spy thing.”</p>
    <p>He pauses to ponder, and strokes the sparse patch of hair he calls a beard while in the process.</p>
    <p>“Non, a real spy wouldn’t tell me their name, they wouldn’t, weh.”  He gives the cryptid a suspicious look.  “What’s your name, ‘en?  An mais where’d you come from?”</p>
    <p>The cryptid sighs overdramatically.</p>
    <p>"I'm Shady," she says, "I got on Envoyer at the Offered hand. And I'm not a spy."</p>
    <p>Acris ponders a moment longer.  Spies shouldn’t know anything about Envoyer yet, and his master’s schedule does include a place called The Offered Hand, but that doesn’t mean that this shady cryptid isn’t a spy who shouldn’t be here.</p>
    <p>“If you’re definitely, for shore, not a spy,” he comes up with a brilliant plan, “you’d be willing to go sit on the mound and study with me there, weh?  I gots lots to do a’fore Master Nonc gets home.  And spies don’t like bein’ all out in the open and stuff.”</p>
    <p>Shady pauses, then gives a toothy black smile.</p>
    <p>"Oooh! That's clever. Uh…" she glances at the curtains, realizing it's still dark. She looks down and shuffles the papers on his desk, "Oh, spell tables."</p>
    <p>The cat jumps up on the table next to her and gives her a stare. She sighs.</p>
    <p>"Sure," Shady relents, "I need to keep studying too…" </p>
    <p>“Your master give you assignments while he’s busy too?”  Acris collects his materials and leads the way out the door.  “Maybe we ken help eachother, weh?”</p>
    <p>"Uh…" Shady moves some of her hair out of the way and looks at the cat, "Something… like that. Have a lot to learn. My teacher… can be weird to learn from. Help would be nice."</p>
    <p>Acris helpfully points out the stack of blank papyrus and the reference book on the shelf on his way out the curtain.</p>
    <p>“You seen the mound yet, Shady?” Acris tries to keep up a conversation as they follow the floating footpaths to the false hill.  Centered in the temporarily larger settlement, it is surrounded by a moat from which its height was removed.  Acris knows that there are usually Responsible Adults available there at any time of day or night, as it’s the best location to use communal space for cooking large portions.</p>
    <p>“No,” Shady answers a little quietly as they walk. Even though it’s dark, she glances around nervously at the handful of elves moving around the docked rafts, “Don’t get out much…” </p>
    <p>“Mais la!  But how are you gon’ be a good spy if’n you stay in alla time?”  Acris snags a weak lantern and hangs it on a pole over a table on top of the mound, not too close to the grownups, but not so far that they won’t actually have supervision in case he’s wrong about changing his mind and Shady really is a for real spy.  </p>
    <p>The apprentice sets out his study materials and makes sure there’s space for Shady to sit with him. She sits across from him and lays out the study materials he brought. The cat jumps up next to her and gently baps her on the elbow.</p>
    <p>“Oh,” she mumbles, “Sorry, Eyeswith. You can talk again.”</p>
    <p>“<i>Finally,</i>” the cat grumbles, “You gotta stop doing that.” </p>
    <p>“Mais, that ain’t no normal cat.”  Acris gives Eyeswith a sideways glance.  “You call him Eyeswit?  Eyes wit what?”</p>
    <p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OFpfTd0EIs">Eyes Without a Face</a>,” she explains, giving the cat a slight pet, “‘Cuz that’s what he looks like in the dark. Ink made him, to protect me and help me learn magic.”</p>
    <p>“<i>Ink</i> made him?”  Acris says, in a voice that definitely does not break at the sudden mental image of the elf-snatching monster with the creepy tattoos and exhibitionist clothing choices.  He leans slightly away from the constructed cat.</p>
    <p>“Maaaais... you shore he’s - yanno - safe?”</p>
    <p>Eyeswith snorts indignantly.</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” Shady looks at Acris curiously, “Why wouldn’t he be…?” </p>
    <p>“Doesn’t Ink, like, you know,” Acris fumbles, “<small>steal people?</small>”</p>
    <p>“Well yeah,” she shrugs, “But he always brings them back.”</p>
    <p>“So you ain’t worried, not one bit, that he gon’ show up an,” Acris makes a wobbly gesture with one webbed hand.  “Steal all yer secrets while yer sleeping?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t sleep,” she states casually. </p>
    <p>“You... don’t?” Acris asks, cautiously curious.  “Don’t you git tired, weh?”</p>
    <p>"No…" she shrugs, "We're just... weird."</p>
    <p>“Wow...”  Acris is honestly quite impressed by this revelation.  “Mais!  What’s you do wit’ allazat extra time ‘en?  Ain’t all chores issit?”</p>
    <p>"No," Shady looks honestly embarrassed , "Um… I study. Or sew. Spin yarn. Maybe just think. I like the quiet."</p>
    <p>Acris thinks a moment before answering.</p>
    <p>“Sure sounds nice, weh.”  He flips back to the spell chart he was working on, smoothing it out across the table.  “Mais, if you done run’t away, how long’s you think you gon’ stay here?”</p>
    <p>"Dunno," Shady lays out the fresh inkwell she brought along with the papers she was carrying, "Was thinking about running somewhere else, but… not bad here. Might stay a while. Hm. Hey."</p>
    <p>Shady takes one of the pages of Smilisca's instructions. She reads through it for a few moments.</p>
    <p>"Neat," she notes, "This is a way easier method for calculating the thaumatoreactive variation in a spell's elemental transmogrification. Ink has me write out the whole equation. Lemme write this down…"</p>
    <p>Shady takes one of the spare quills then pulls over some blank papyrus and starts working from Smilisca's notes.</p>
    <p>The two young students spend the evening nose down in detailed arcane texts.  Acris doesn’t ask again if Shady plans to leave soon.</p>
    <p>Days later, the military returns, exhausted but triumphant, and entirely without injury if you ignore a few incidental wolf bites from the transit.  And Smilisca travels with them by kayak, just to make sure that if they’re ambushed again on the way back to Winter Quarters he’ll be able to do something about it.</p>
    <p>He has finally proven, to himself if not to anyone else, that he can make a difference in such dire situations.  It’s a good feeling, too, returning to his nice, safe raft with no new names for the nightly recitations.</p>
    <p>It’s late when he finally ties up his kayak and pulls himself up onto his raft. Nothing seems exploded, so maybe Acris managed to not get up to any trouble. Smilisca can see dim candle light coming through the heavy winter curtains, so maybe he’s actually sitting down and doing his chores for once.</p>
    <p>“Hey Acris, whatcho-” Smilisca stops as he pulls up the curtain and steps into the living space.</p>
    <p>Acris is working on his homework alright. He’s sitting at the table with pages of papyrus out in front of him, covered in sketches of very good spell tables. That’s surprising enough. Across from Acris sits what is undoubtedly a cryptid elf. The elf looks young, nearly a foot and a half shorter than the other cryptids he’s met and with lighter features. She’s writing her own set of arcane equations while a black cat naps lazily on the table. The two elves look up at him as he enters. He is briefly stunned.</p>
    <p>“Master Nonc!” Acris chirps brightly, quickly sorting the pages in front of him into a tidy stack.  “I done got the spell tables you axed for writ out!  Ken you check my work?”</p>
    <p>Smilisca stares at his apprentice in bafflement.  The kid sure has changed in the last year.  It’s almost like he’s growing up or something.</p>
    <p>“Weh, I can do that,” Smilisca says slowly, taking a careful seat at the table next to his nephew.  “Who’s yer friend, Acris?”</p>
    <p>“Hi,” the cryptid speaks quietly in a voice that is shy but strangely clearer than the other cryptid voices he has heard, “I’m Shady.” </p>
    <p>A cryptid is in his raft unexpectedly.  Smilisca isn’t entirely sure what he thinks about this new development right away.  It’s going to take some adjustment.  Is she actually as young as she looks?  She looks closer to Acris’s age than...</p>
    <p>“Bienvenu, Shady,” he chooses to say, diplomatically, “Mais, how’d you come to help Acris with his work, weh?”</p>
    <p>“Um,” Shady’s eyes dart between Acris and Smilisca, “Kinda… ran away from home. Miss Eina found me. She said I could stay. Ran into Acris poking around. You make nice spell tables.”</p>
    <p>Smilisca is taken aback by the compliment.  It’s not every day someone shows appreciation for the efforts he’s put in to optimizing his formulae.  Despite what his base assumptions about a cryptid elf would have him believe, she’s not acting like a millenia old refugee from before the shatter.  She’s acting like a teenager.</p>
    <p>“Miss Eina said you could stay, weh?” Smilisca asks, looking for clarification, “She give you any instructions while you’re here?”</p>
    <p>“She said I should apprentice to someone…” Shady looks at the papyrus on the table, “I like magic. Maybe I could be an apprentice too…?” </p>
    <p>“Weh, if’n you’re sure about it.”  Smilisca gestures toward the page she was also working on.  “Migh’ as well start here.  Now you two tell me ‘bout how yall got these numbers.”</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Shady looks back down at the page, “Um, Acris, help me out…”</p>
