    <h1>A New Family</h1>
    <p>Bryti is moving through a mangrove swamp so dense she cannot see the sky. The werewolf does not know what to expect. The directions she had been given told her to follow a trail. It was hard for her to see the narrow strip of muddy grass she was following as a trail, but it was the best she could find.</p>
    <p>The path turns alongside a slow moving river. That, at least, was expected. This trail should take her to Winter Quarters, and she should be close. She begins to walk down it slowly, making sure she is visible. She knows the Crocodilians see her in a positive light, but does not know how the rest of her river elves view her. She doesn't want to take any chances. She can't waste this.</p>
    <p>She is also beginning to think that maybe river elves don't use the footpaths too often.</p>
    <p>Her assumption is highly accurate.  The river elf that is following her is not using the trail, but the river itself.  Prosalirus Prosaliridae is an older elf, one of the Pathfinders, and he lurks just below the water’s surface until he’s sure of the identity of his prey.  What other blade elf would be carrying that sword?  And she certainly is easy to follow.</p>
    <p>Prosalirus emerges silently from the water and stands in the shallows just out of reach to her side.</p>
    <p>“Greetings and salutations, Honored Wolf!”  His spoken Elven has none of the regular river elf accent.  He is very proud of his perfect diction.  “It is very good to meet you.  Please permit me to be your guide through the traps.”</p>
    <p>Bryti narrowly avoids jumping in surprise at his arrival. She hadn't even smelled him. She is suddenly very glad she has an invitation. She quickly recovers her composure and gives him a bow.</p>
    <p>"Thank you for the hospitality, friend. It is good to meet you as well. I would absolutely accept your aid as a guide. Please, lead on."</p>
    <p>Prosalirus gives a little bow in return.  He is a cultured gentleman in the finest Elven traditions.  The river elf offers her a hand to help balance on the slimy logs hidden in the reeds so she can step around the triplines that cross the path on solid ground.</p>
    <p>Bryti smiles slightly at such an unexpected display of civility. She accepts the elf's help in navigating the treacherous terrain, which is good as she turns out to sorely need the assistance. She nearly falls on a slime covered log, and likely would have without the help. She accepts that she's in the river elves' world now.</p>
    <p>When they reach Winter Quarters, Bryti sees the river elven city as never before.  Instead of strung out along the river in single file, the flotilla’s rafts peacefully float in shallow water, finding space for each between the trees.  Temporary boardwalks float between them, building a complex network to travel between each raft.</p>
    <p>Several new rafts appear to have been started recently.  Even though it’s getting colder now, there is always work to be done.</p>
    <p>But as soon as they step from the hidden path to the safety of the flotilla, the werewolf and her native guide are surrounded.  Elves seem to come out of the woodwork, and some actually pop out of deeper pools in the water nearby, all with wide smiles.  There’s a great cheer, and Bryti hears someone shout, “Our wolf is here!”  She has earned a hero’s welcome, and the river elves are giving it to her in their most secret Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p>Prosalirus winks at her.</p>
    <p>Bryti stands absolutely stunned. She looks over the warm greeting she is receiving with wide eyes, then turns to Prosalirus.</p>
    <p>"This… is for me?"</p>
    <p>A younger river elf pushes flowers into her hands.</p>
    <p>“Of course it is.  It is a very rare day when our heroes come to visit.”  Prosalirus nods deference to the werewolf.  “And this place would have been destroyed if you did not intervene on our behalf.”</p>
    <p>"Thank you," she speaks to the young elf. She stares at the flowers in her hands for a long moment.</p>
    <p>"I was merely doing my duty…" she speaks quietly.</p>
    <p>“There is nothing wrong with taking pride in your work,” Prosalirus offers quietly.</p>
    <p>“I suppose you are right,” She holds the flowers gently, “but this is a first.”</p>
    <p>The older elf smiles again.  And he leads her through the cheering crowd to one of the smaller rafts near the center of the settlement.  It’s the home of Staurois and Ny. Bryti gives another respectful bow to Prosalirus before stepping onto the raft. She tucks the flowers under her arm and enters the dwelling. </p>
    <p>She finds Staurois sitting on the floor with a steaming mug in one hand and a written report of tree plantings in the other.  Ny lies in a hammock and a little baby wiggles on a soft rug next to her.  The babe is very chubby, and seems to be in the process of figuring out how to crawl.</p>
    <p>Bryti is taken aback momentarily by the scene, eyes settling on Ny and the infant before turning back to Staurois. She gives a formal bow to him before speaking.</p>
    <p>“I…” She pauses to regain her composure, “I thank you for inviting me to your home.”</p>
    <p>Staurois puts the papers down and stands to greet her with open arms.</p>
    <p>“Oh cher!  You fin’lly got here!”  He pulls her into a sideways hug.</p>
    <p>Still catching up a little bit, Bryti accepts the hug. She still seems unsure about the situation, but does not mind the gesture.</p>
    <p>“Of course,” she smiles slightly, “I don’t get many invitations.”</p>
    <p>“Mais, foh shore you wouldn’t.”  The bald elf gives her a serious look.  “Leavin’ behind all them corpses an’ never an explanation ‘bout ‘em.  You know, if’n more folks had an idea what you was about they’d support you completely.”  He gestures out the curtained doorway.  “Fer example, weh?”</p>
    <p>“I..” she scratches her head, “I suppose I can see how my actions might cause alarm. I am accustomed to performing my duties in secret. This is… a new experience for me.”</p>
    <p>“First ‘a many, I ‘ope, me,” Ny pipes up from where she trying to entice little Natator to crawl.</p>
    <p>“Weh,” Staurois agrees.  “We’re sure glad to have ya.”</p>
    <p>“And I am glad to be here,” she nods towards Ny and Natator, “It seems there is someone I have not met.”</p>
    <p>Bryti moves slowly and sits next to Ny. She holds out a hand and speaks with surprising gentleness, “Hello little one, who are you?”</p>
    <p>Natator makes a squeaky wah noise.</p>
    <p>“This is Natator.”  Ny smiles quietly.  The little baby stretches a chubby webbed hand toward the stranger.</p>
    <p>Bryti lets the infant grab her finger. She smiles slightly as he tugs on her hand.</p>
    <p>“It is good to meet you, Natator,” she turns to Ny, “He is strong. You must be very proud.” </p>
    <p>The happy parents both beam at the werewolf.</p>
    <p>“Weh,” both agree.  “T-Tate’s a long time gettin’ here, an’ we’re sure thankful for ‘im.”  Ny answers.</p>
    <p>Bryti smiles slightly more as the infant attempts to nibble on her finger, “Ny, Staurois… I fought for my own reasons. You don’t know me. I helped you, and I am glad for it. Truly.”</p>
    <p>She sighs slightly, “I could still be the vicious beast that some claim I am, yet… you invited me into your home. Why?”</p>
    <p>Staurois gives her a serious look.</p>
    <p>“Mais, because you ain’t.”  He gestures at her, a vague up and down motion to indicate the whole person.  “You ain’t some Afflicted out to spread th’ disease.  An you ain’t somewhat here to claim us as yers by knockin’ over the biggest an’ strongest of us in a demonstration of yer right ta’ rule via murderin’ yer way into the job.”  He shakes his head.  “Nah, ‘stead ‘a killin our Warmaster you done charmed her.”</p>
    <p>Ny laughs at the comment.  Natator gums Bryti’s finger.</p>
    <p>“An,” Staruois continues, “she’s th’ best judge a’ character I ken count on, weh.  Her vouchin’ fer ya gits you en invite to visit any time.  Yer own actions done made it so that I’m jus’ distractin’ ya while the fires for the gumbo git lit so you ken have a right proper feast in a bit here.”</p>
    <p>Bryti laughs at that, “Then I have been outmaneuvered. Thank you again. Ah, speaking of Litoria… is she around?” </p>
    <p>Ny chuckles.</p>
    <p>“Weh, I’m sure she’ll be aroun’ somewhere,” Staurois answers.  “I’m sure she’s back from escortin’ her cousin to Alfyr again by now, weh.”</p>
    <p>"Good," she smiles at Natator again, almost looking comfortable, "Would you mind if I went and found her?"</p>
    <p>“Go ahead!” Ny answers, and makes a shooing motion.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” almost reflexively, she bows.</p>
    <p>She rubs a thumb over the baby’s bald head before standing. She nods  to Staurois on the way out, “You know, he looks just like you.”</p>
    <p>Bryti steps out the door to look for her girlfriend.  She has to wander around the parked flotilla for a while, as Litoria was apparently out checking the defenses when word arrived that the wolf had come to town.  Everywhere she goes, river elves are happy to meet her, asking to shake her hand, gifting her with snacks, or giving very respectful bows. Without exception, she accepts the gifts and returns the respect. She seems a bit baffled by the gestures.</p>
    <p>One of the only permanent structures in the settlement is a low earthen mound with a flat top.  On top of it Bryti spots several river elves working over a fire to stir a massive kettle.  Her sensitive nose smells something very flavorful being cooked.</p>
    <p>Curious, and perhaps more than a little hungry, Bryti approaches the structure slowly. She stops, pauses, then walks forward. No longer stiff and careful, she approaches as a friend. She sniffs a little and looks to the elves tending it.</p>
    <p>“Please tell me this is something to be shared.”</p>
    <p>A gold colored river elf with a green copper symbol of Calestros pinning her stole out of the way startles when Bryti approaches.</p>
    <p>“Oh non!  You done ruined the surprise!”  The cleric gives a conspiratorial wink as she blatantly feigns dismay.  “It’s gon’ be a bit longer ‘afore it’s done.  A special visitor calls for a feast an’ weather this cold calls for a gumbo.  Cher, this’s for you.”</p>
    <p>“That… is something new,” she gives the concoction a curious look, then turns to the elf, “I’m sorry, I don’t think we’ve met.” </p>
    <p>The cleric rubs her damp palms on her apron quickly and then offers a webbed hand to shake.</p>
    <p>“Eina.”  She gestures to the other river elves, “And these are Ascaphus and Bombina.”</p>
    <p>The werewolf nods to her, "My name is Bryti."</p>
    <p>Eina raises an eyebrow.  The other two get back to work stirring and arguing in broken Elven about whether or not the vegetables have cooked down enough.</p>
    <p>“Just Bryti?  So easy to answer now?”  She steps away from the fire so they can talk.</p>
    <p>Bryti gives her a slight smile, “I left the flotilla as a stranger. I was asked to return as a friend.”</p>
    <p>“Cher, that’s an understatement.”</p>
    <p>Bryti shrugs, “I am not known for my subtlety.”</p>
    <p>“Mais la, no you ain’t.”  Eina shrugs, her expression friendly and a bit bemused.  “I heard abou’ whatchu did - runnin’ an pressin’ em ‘till you about fell yourself.  It’s a hard thing, that.  Want you a chance to sit a spell an’ talk about it?”</p>
    <p>Bryti gives Eina a curious look, but nods, "Yes, actually."</p>
    <p>Eina leads Bryti a little further away from the bubbling pot of distracting smells, and sits on an exposed mangrove root.</p>
    <p>“Come on into my office,” her friendly tone hides any sarcasm meant, “it migh’ not be as tidy as it should be, but it’ll do.”  She waits for Bryti to sit down and then continues, “Do you resent the need for it then?”</p>
    <p>Bryti settles down on a particularly comfortable root. She unshoulders her sheathed sword and leans it against a nearby tree, still within arm's reach. She turns to Eina and simply nods, a somber expression on her face.</p>
    <p>"Through my wrath and pain," she quotes the inscription on her sword, "I shall purge this wretched curse, the last trace of us."</p>
    <p>She pauses before continuing, "I engraved that on a sword I forged in the ruins of my home, from the steel of my family's weapons and the silver used to murder them. My sword is a mourning blade. I cannot bear to name it. Since then, I have wandered the world, searching for pockets of affliction to burn out. Do you know what I've learned?"</p>
    <p>She looks at Eina with surprising intensity, "The affliction is the least of the evils my people inflicted on this world. I've seen the effects of slavery, starvation, genocide, hunting people for sport… I've seen the horrible scars my people tore into the people of this world, and I want it to end. I want us to be gone. I want us to be erased, forgotten by history. I wish to purge this affliction to remove the one last remaining atrocity my people brought into this world. I want it to end."</p>
    <p>She lowers her head, "We deserve it…"</p>
    <p>Eina lets her sit in silence for a moment.  The gravity of the statements deserves it.</p>
    <p>“Mais,” she exhales, “that’s a heavy load you’re carrying all by yerself.”  Eina offers her open palms.  “Carryin’ too much ‘ll sink you ‘afore you even hit more rapids in time’s stream.  And you’re not at the end yet, non.”</p>
    <p>“I ain’t got the responsibility to absolve you of it all.  That’s not for me, non, but it’s got to be unpacked.  Pick one.  Jus’ one thing to start with.  It can be anything, e’en somethin’ real small.  Let’s drop off some a’ tha’ cargo where it rightly belongs.”</p>
    <p>Bryti gives Eina an extremely vulnerable look, "Luna is dying. I… I don't know exactly why, but something we did, something we became hurt her so deeply that she's stopped talking entirely… but she's still sending visions, crying out for help. I'm… involved, somehow. I don't know why. I don't know what to do. I don't want Her to suffer because of her foolish children."</p>
    <p>“Oh, cher, gods only die when there is noone left who believes in them.”  Eina falls back on her formal education.  “‘S long as someone believes, She will live.  The Creators, though, they’re connected to their children.  They suffer what their children suffer, like any parent will hurt.  Luna’s children are truly suffering, and the wounds, as you done said, are self-inflicted.”</p>
    <p>She reaches out to take the werewolf’s hands.  “E’en the gods need hope.  If Her children ain’t got it, then She won’t have none neither.”  Eina pauses, her tone serious.  “If you get your wish, ‘an you erase all evidence you done existed, then She <i>will</i> die.”  She rubs a thumb over the other elf’s calloused palms.  “If’n you want to <i>help</i> Her, you’ve gotta find somethin’ to look forward to.  You’ve gotta find your own hope for Her to to create Hers.”</p>
    <p>Bryti looks at Eina's hands, allowing the kind gesture, "I… have found something to look forward to. Here. I had thought it a weakness, a temptation away from my path, but now… I have met so many of you that have given me nothing but kindness. More than that, though… I think that Luna wants me to be here, among these elves. But why? Why me? Why am I so special?"</p>
    <p>She looks to Eina, "Why am I the one guided to people who care about me, when so many others are dead?"</p>
    <p>“Now there’s a familiar question.”  Eina smiles and gives her hands a squeeze.  “Erryone asks that eventually.  An fer some, it’s a real comfort to be tol’ that they ain’t special, jus’ lucky.  Not erryone gets literal messages from the Divine, mais la, so I’m not gonna give you that advice nugget.”</p>
    <p>Eina smiles sadly at Bryti.  And she recalls many a fireside discussion with many a blade elf in the past.</p>
    <p>“Nah, we’re all tools for the gods to use, erry last one ‘a us.  Some are more useful ‘en others.  The choices we make can hone us, or it can blunt our edges, make us useless for Their purpose.  Sometimes, we’re the blade in Their hand.  It’s our choices that make us useful.”  She pauses, all seriousness.  “She’s picked you up.  Be useful.”</p>
    <p>The ferocity returns to Bryti as she gives Eina a smile, "In that case, so far so good. I can follow the path my Goddess needs me to, even if I don't understand it yet. Thank you, Eina."</p>
    <p>“Yer always welcome.”  She smiles.  “It’s my purpose.”</p>
    <p>Bryti stands and shoulders her sword, "Then I will let you know when I figure out what mine is. Now, have you seen Litoria anywhere?" </p>
    <p>Eina laughs.  “A course you’re a lookin for her!”  She makes a vague gesture in a somewhat northern direction.  “Last I heard she was about the border up toward Surt’s river, probably headed thisaway now.  But don’ git too far off.  We expect you back for the feast in a bit, weh.”</p>
    <p> Bryti laughs, "Then you're in luck, because right now my nose is telling me my purpose is to find out what 'gumbo' tastes like. I'll be back, Eina."</p>
    <p>With another polite bow, Bryti sets off again to search for Litoria. Though it sprawls, Winter Quarters is not a terribly large space at the moment.  She finds the northern edge of the settlement quickly, and is only accosted by a few more river elves offering their welcome, their thanks, and from one an evergreen crown of woven branches.</p>
    <p>And that’s where she finds Litoria, riding Sauver out of the swamp with an enormous boar carcass draped across the hippo’s back.</p>
    <p>"Hello, Litoria, Sauvier" Bryti approaches with the evergreen crown on her head and folds her arms, "I have no idea what this means." </p>
    <p>Litoria croaks out a laugh.</p>
    <p>“Looks like you’ve gotten yourself crowned king of the fete, weh!”</p>
    <p>Bryti smiles as she approaches, "You may want to brace yourself, but I am beginning to suspect your people like me. Keen intuition, you know."</p>
    <p>“Weh, that’s possible,” Litoria concedes, “maybe maybe."</p>
    <p>Bryti stops next to Sauvier and looks up at her, "It… is good to see you again."</p>
    <p>Litoria slides off the hippopotamus and hefts the boar over her shoulder.</p>
    <p>“It is.”  She smiles slowly, like the skill is still a bit rusty.  “I wasn’t sure you would come.  Mais, I got you something.  Hope you like pork, weh.”  She lifts the boar slightly.</p>
    <p>"Oh, thou noble hunter, I am smitten by your display of skill and valour!" Bryti briefly feigns swooning. It is unconvincing.</p>
    <p>"Of course I like it," Bryti replies with a smile, "And of course I came. Where else would I find you?"</p>
    <p>With a chuckle, Litoria gestures vaguely northish.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t sure tha’ you wanted the crowd, non.”  She shrugs and starts walking across the boardwalk toward where Eina and her crew had the fire going.  “We were gonna start lookin’ for ya.”  Divested of the porcine burden, it is obvious now that the hippopotamus has been harnessed with camping supplies in quantity enough for a journey of several days.</p>
    <p>Bryti looks at the supplies that the hippo is carrying, then sighs slightly, "I… admit, this is a new experience. I am not used to being the center of such attention," she glances at the wreath on her head, "... could be worse."</p>
    <p>“Let’s go make it better,” Litoria smiles softly, and Sauver gently nudges Bryti with her enormous snout.  “Th’ runner mentioned food?”</p>
    <p>"Yes, I bumped into Eina on the way out, something called a gumbo?"</p>
    <p>“Pfooo-wee!  There’s a treat!”  Litoria shoulders her burden and picks up her speed.  “Ain’t everyday someun’ll go through that trouble.”</p>
    <p>"Well, glad to be of service," Bryti turns to follow her.  If the flotilla seems to have depopulated suddenly on her second trip through it, the question of where everyone went isn’t left without an answer for very long.  Back on the mound, someone’s erected a little canopy, and decorated with evergreen branches.  Mismatched dishes have been acquired from all over, and the clerics are organizing the assorted donations of food to the party.</p>
    <p>When Eina spots the two approaching she waves them over, and the party begins in earnest.  Someone presses a bowl of rice into Bryti’s hands and then ladles thick gumbo over it.  The hog vanishes into the arms of a group of rangers who fiercely debate the best location for a roasting pit.  The gathering is full of good cheer.</p>
    <p>For once in her life, Bryti actually manages to cheer up. It takes her a few minutes to become accustomed to the attention she's getting, but eventually even she is unable to resist the infectious cheer that the river elves share with her. Nor is she able to resist the cooking, and apparently werewolves can pack away a legitimately impressive amount of food.</p>
    <p>In a brief moment of quiet, Bryti turns to Litoria with an odd look on her face, "You… really do see me as family, don't you?" She asks quietly. </p>
    <p>“Weh,” Litoria nods, “how many differen’ ways we gotta show it before you’ll believe?”</p>
    <p>Bryti opens her mouth, then closes it. She turns away from Litoria and wipes something away from her cheek before answering, "It… seems you only needed one more."</p>
    <p>In the closeness of the moment, Litoria leans against her shoulder mutely. Bryti shakes slightly upon being touched, then leans her head on Litoria's shoulder. She feels a small drop of salty water touch her skin. Bryti says nothing before raising her head again, but keeps her shoulder touching.</p>
    <p>Some time later, Bryti leaves the mound to get a breather from all these elves and finds herself on the boardwalk mostly alone.  Sitting quietly in the murky water just out of reach of the manufactured land is the fattest alligator she has ever seen, and on its back is a familiar Crocodilian.</p>
    <p>Allophryne gives a wave and Blinkin slowly opens his one eye, points it at Bryti, and then closes it again.</p>
    <p>"It's good to see you, Allophryne," Bryti sits on the edge of the boardwalk across from him, "Still no fuzz behind the ears, right?"</p>
    <p>“Ain’t got any need to howl, non,” he answers with a smile.</p>
    <p>Bryti nods and folds her arms. She waits for a few moments before speaking again, "Are you still called?"</p>
    <p>“Weh, I am commanded.”  He laughs and kicks at the water.</p>
    <p>"Sometimes the Gods whisper in quiet riddles, and sometimes they shake your shoulders and yell…"  Bryti raises an eyebrow at him. </p>
    <p>“He speaks to me in dreams, but god of madness an’ all, they’re sure a trip.”  Allophryne sighs.  “Last one say She needs my help.  It’s a pretty clear command, that.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods, and her tone grows more serious, "I was unfair to you, Allophryne. It is painfully clear that Luna intended my path to cross yours. You made your intentions perfectly clear, and instead I was selfishly shortsighted. You offered to help me fulfill my mission, and I doubted your commitment because you're not a Lycan… but who else is left who can carry this burden?" She shakes her head, "I apologize for doubting you. You have demonstrated your conviction. I will help train you."</p>
    <p>“You mean that, weh?”  He looks to her somewhat incredulously.</p>
    <p>She nods solemnly, "I don't know what will happen to me… but you were right. What I do can't be lost."</p>
    <p>“When do we start, en’?”  He leans forward eagerly.</p>
    <p>"First thing tomorrow, when I haven't eaten a few gallons of food," she chuckles, "We'll get an idea of where your skills stand. I imagine you won't need much in the way of combat and tracking training, but I'll still need an assessment."</p>
    <p>“Aigh’t.”  Allophryne nods.  “Mebee I’ll get a good night’s sleep wi’ that settled.”</p>
    <p>Bryti gives him an odd look, "Don't count on it. If the dreams ever stop, I'll let you know. I told you it would be hard. Welcome to Luna's service." </p>
    <p>Allophryne grins.  He’s ready for this.  It’s all he’s been hoping for in the last several months. Bryti looks to him and then back towards the distant music and sounds of happy voices.</p>
    <p>“I suppose I should get back,” she pauses, “I am… not used to receiving that much attention.” </p>
    <p>“Mais, it’ll calm down ‘ventually.”  Allophryne shrugs.  “Erry’un’s always excited ‘bout a new family member.  If’n you stick around you’ll be just another part of the flotilla in time.”</p>
    <p>Bryti gets a distant look on her face before replying, “Perhaps. I will see you tomorrow, Allophryne.”</p>
    <p>She gives him a polite nod, then slowly begins to walk back to the party.  The party lasts several more hours, with the river elves having a grand time celebrating their wolf’s visit.  As the party winds down, Litoria invites Bryti to come back to her raft to stay.  It’s not unlike the wolf’s first visit to the flotilla.</p>
    <p>Acris and Smilisca are not there this time.  The two women have the raft to themselves.  In the winter, heavier curtains hang in the doorways to keep in the warmth.  Litoria lights a little potbellied stove and puts some water on to fill the small space with steam.</p>
    <p>Bryti takes off her boots when she steps onto the raft. She removes her heavy cloak and armor, then sets her sword on the hooks on the wall. She looks at it for a moment, then runs her hand along the braid she still wears. She turns away from it and steps over to Litoria.</p>
    <p>“So,” she asks, “Smilisca is off with Terje at the fort, I assume?”</p>
    <p>“Weh,” Litoria answers, “an’ he took th’ ‘prentise with him.”</p>
    <p>Bryti smirks slightly, "Leaving poor you, having to host your wolf all alone, when no one will even come in because they don't want to let all your heat out." </p>
    <p>“How will I ever survive?”</p>
    <p>Bryti laughs genuinely at that. She walks over to Litoria. As she approaches, Litoria is surprised to see that there are tears in her eyes again. Almost cautiously, the wolf reaches out to touch her.</p>
    <p>Litoria leans into the touch.  And there’s a pause.</p>
    <p>“Make yerself at home, cher,” the river elf offers gently, “is no great fort, but it’s what we have.”</p>
    <p>"Home…" Bryti speaks the word carefully, as if she's worried she will break it, "Litoria… there is not a fort, castle, or palace in this world that could possibly make me happier. There is nowhere I would rather be."</p>
    <p>Rendered speechless, Litoria leans in close and kisses the wolf on the cheek.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>“Good,” the werewolf shoulders her blade again.</p>
    <p>Allophryne does not feel like he is doing ‘good.’ He has been sparring with the werewolf for a couple of hours, and that’s after he spent half a day showing her his hunting and tracking skills. He felt competent enough showing her his survival skills, but now that it’s an actual fight, he’s feeling in a bit over his head.</p>
    <p>He’s managed to actually land a blow here and there. After all, he’s trained well in fighting Lycans and boy does this one fight like a Lycan. She, however, has mercilessly been slamming him with the flat of that boat oar of a blade over and over again. He’s fought werewolves, but never one like her. She’s a terrifying combatant in her hybrid form. He is beginning to wonder if there is anywhere on his body where he doesn’t have a bruise.</p>
    <p>As he sucks in a breath to replace the one the hilt of her sword just drove out of him, she signals for the spar to end. He sits down heavily on a nearby log to breathe and drink some water. Did training hurt this much when he was younger?</p>
    <p>“As expected,” Bryti shifts back to her elf form and sits next to him, “Your tracking skills are more than up to task, as is your situational awareness. You have more than adequate combat skills. All of which I expected. You are an experienced veteran, likely having already killed many of my kind. A bit of a departure from starry eyed idiots like me who joined young.”</p>
    <p>“T’ain’t my fault took gettin’ bit twice fer me ta get the message.”  The older elf rubs the back of his head slowly.  “This might’a been easier if’n Blinkin’ could help like usual.”</p>
    <p>“Maybe,” Bryti gives him a somewhat sympathetic look, “But… well, I,”</p>
    <p>“Don’t want to get ate by an alligator twice yer weight?  Yeah, I get it.”  In honesty, he’s being kind to the obese gator.  It’s significantly more than twice.</p>
    <p>Bryti barks out a laugh, “Yes, that’s part of it. I am not certain alligators understand the concept of ‘sparring.’ At any rate, it’s abundantly clear that your hunting skills don’t need any work. What you really need is to know what it is to be a sacred purifier.”</p>
    <p>“What’m I missin’ then?”  Allophryne leans on his weapon.  “I’ve experienced Calestros.  What ken you tell me of Luna instead?”</p>
    <p>“Like us, Luna has many forms. The one you are familiar with is the Moon - in which she is distant, detached, infinite, unknowable, and wise. She is always watching, and always has another mystery to present you with, usually by her domain of dreams. She is also the mother, her humanoid form such as it is, in which she appears to be a woman with luminous skin. In this form, she’s kind, loving, nurturing, and warm. In her third form, she is the Huntress. In this form, she appears as a massive wolf with pure white fur. In this form, she is ruthless, inescapable, powerful, and perceptive. I… know you are more, ah, associating with her than worshipping her, but you will have to understand all three to serve her. To know when to have the patience and wisdom of the Moon, the kindness and love of the Mother, and when to have the ruthless instinct of the Huntress,” Bryti grunts, “Perhaps we relied a little too heavily on the Huntress near the end, no?” </p>
    <p>“Woulda been good to pay more’n lip service to any of ‘em.”  Allophryne has a flat tone.  “Are there any rules She asks you ta live by?”</p>
    <p>“Luna, even before now, was always… kind of a hands off deity. There are some things that are blasphemous, yes. Silver, most notably. The affliction, and intentionally spreading it. Intentionally insulting Her. That… is about the extent of it. Luna is not particularly judgmental, as far as deities go. I’m starting to believe that’s part of why things got so bad, but I digress. Luna wants her followers to be free, to express themselves, and to be in touch with their hybrid souls. Much of her teachings won’t directly apply to you in the first place. I admit, I am not certain how serving her as a non-Lycan will work in general.”</p>
    <p>“Weh, I sure ain’t gonna start shiftin’ shapes or nothin.”  He shrugs.  “Can’t say I’ve really got your hybrid soul thing.  It’s gon’ be a lot ta figure out as we go.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods, “As it should be. The Sacred Purifiers never had strict codified laws or rules, or a single unified way of training. Each Purifier is called for their own reasons, and their calling will shape their path. You’re the only one that will decide what form your mission takes. Which means, I suppose, that you should be thinking about why you’re called to take this path, specifically. Why serve a deity that is not your own? More so than just repaying a debt… Allophryne, you don’t owe me or Luna anything. All we did was save you from a curse of our own making. I helped save plenty of others that day, as well. There are plenty of other ways to help fight the affliction, as well. So why are you called to this path?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know th’ mind of the God.”  Allophryne pulls the pair of holy symbols out from under his scuffed armor.  “Ain’t gon’ pretend to it.  Mais, He’s a mystery, Him.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods, “More truthful than most. It’s not something you have to answer right away. Figuring out the right question first might actually be wiser. Your path is between you and your deity… er, deities. It won’t be easy to learn what it is. Even… Even I struggle with that.”</p>
    <p>“I was under th’ impression you were the expert, havin’ secret knowledge from yer order.”</p>
    <p>“Some, yes, but no amount of secret knowledge will stop personal folly,” she closes her eyes, “I… was convinced that my path was to hunt afflicted werewolves and kill them until I fell fighting. If that were my path, I would have died alone trying to fight that horde. It… has become quite clear that Luna has other plans for me, as much as I have tried to resist seeing it.”</p>
    <p>Allophryne lets out a slow sigh.</p>
    <p>“Glad that ain’t yer path then.  T’ain’t efficient to you to carry on alone, non?”</p>
    <p>“A Purifier typically works alone,” she explains, “But that doesn’t mean that I have to be alone. Not… not in the sense that I was. I can still have a home. I can still have a family,” she turns to him, “I did before. I was a purifier for many decades, but I still had my family and my home to return to. It gave me the strength to carry on. On my missions, though, I was always alone. Now, the world is different… Perhaps I need to reconsider.”</p>
    <p>“When we’re kids, we spend years followin’ a master in a trade we want t’learn.  We earn our tools, an’ we learn to make the livin’ from them’s livin’ it.  I’m a bit old to be apprenticin’ again, but if that’s what it’s gon’ take I’m in.  I’m all in, weh.”  Allophryne pushes himself to stand again, against the protests of his aching limbs.  “If you’ll have me.”</p>
    <p>Bryti laughs as she stands and offers him a hand, “An apprentice? Not exactly what I was planning on, but I suppose as the last remaining Purifier I’m all that passes for a master. You have a lot to learn, Allophryne, and it won’t be as simple as a few heart-to-hearts and some sparring. If you want to learn, you’ll need to come with me. See how it’s actually done. See what we’re really for. What do you say to that?”</p>
    <p>“I’ll go where m’master says.”  He gives her a wink, accepting the help up.  There’s a long pause while he gets his feet back under him.  “You’ll not be ‘posed to meetin’ my family b’fore we leave, weh?  I only got the one daughter left, an’ I oughta tell ‘er ‘bout all this.  T’ain’t a big change for her to trade my one dangerous life of service for another, mais, I owe it t’her to let her know.  An it’d be good fer her to meet you.”</p>
    <p>"Of course I would love to meet her," Bryti smiles, "And I am in no great hurry to leave, either. Clearly, I have been given an opportunity to rest and regain strength. It'd be sacrilege to waste it," she shrugs, "Litoria will have to manage to deal with the burden of hosting a werewolf all on her own. I'm sure she'll manage."</p>
    <p>“Pfwoo - sure she will.”  Allophryne grins.  “How’s the old hunter managin’ that ‘en?”</p>
    <p>Bryti can’t help smiling slightly herself, “It’s difficult, I think, but she’s keeping a close eye on me. She is indeed quite the hunter, I believe she has managed to lure me exactly where she wants me.”</p>
    <p>That earns a chuckle.</p>
    <p>“Gotta be ‘en upstream paddle t’ git her comfort’ble wi’ tha’ wolf part ‘a the hybrid soul, weh?”  Allophryne suggests more seriously.  “Advice from an old Croc?  Start wi’ the wolf, not the hybrid.”</p>
    <p>She raises her eyebrow at him, “You think so? I imagine all of this is strange and none easy, but realizing you are now in a relationship with a literal wolf… I… I don’t want to push her too hard. She’s dealing with so much as it is…”</p>
    <p>“Takin’ it slow’s a good plan.”  Allophryne nods.  “Mais, it’s gon’ hafta happen sometime.”</p>
    <p>Bryti sighs, “I will talk to her about it. I promise. You really think starting with the wolf would be best? She has seen me in my hybrid form several times.”</p>
    <p>“She’s seen the hybrid fight, weh.  Mais the wolf’s less ‘a what she fights ‘en the werewolf is.”  He gestures with his weapon.  “The wolf’s not got th’ armor.  It’s more vulnerable.”</p>
    <p>“Not twelve feet tall and breathing ice like a white dragon,” Bryti snorts a laugh, “Also I can’t talk as a wolf, so I am prevented from saying anything remarkably stupid. I think you have a point, Allophryne. Wolf it is. Thank you.” </p>
    <p>He smiles quietly, runs his palm across the shaft of his weapon.</p>
    <p>“Weh, I’ll leave you to it, en.”</p>
    <p>She nods to him, “Very well, <i>apprentice</i>,” she smirks, “I will heed your advice. I think that’s enough training for one day. Ready to head home?” </p>
    <p>He salutes, and any blade elf worth their whetstone would find it a sloppy one, but it’s the thought that counts sometimes. Bryti continues the sly smile and returns it perfectly. She helps him gather their equipment from the clearing, and they begin to head back to Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p>As they return, Bryti’s sensitive nose picks up the smoky smells of burning wood and cooking pig. She heads in that direction, eager to see how exactly the river elves will prepare such a bounty as a full hog.</p>
    <p>A roasting rack has been assembled over a fire built in a long trench.  The whole hog has been splayed over it, and a couple younger elves have been tasked with rotating the hog frequently.  Bryti finds Litoria listening to a report from a messenger from Alfyr with news about the progress of the new unit’s training, and reading her mail.</p>
    <p>Bryti walks over to Litoria and nods to her, “Well, it seems Allophryne is here to stay. I wasn’t able to dissuade him from following me, no matter how many times I walloped him over the head. Apparently I have an apprentice now.”</p>
    <p>“Congrats, master!”  Litoria grins.  “And uh, here?”  She hands a letter to the werewolf.</p>
    <p>Bryti blinks in surprise as she opens the letter, “Who sent me mail? Huh. Anasatri?” Her eyes dart over the page with curiosity as she reads. She suddenly snorts a laugh, “Bring a fur coat, she says… Anasatri has invited me to visit the observatory. I believe she thinks I can help them rebuild it. Not sure, but it doesn’t hurt to try. Mind if I borrow Allophryne for the journey? He has a lot to learn, and the Observatory always played an important role in my duties. He should see it.” </p>
    <p>“He’s yer ‘prentice.”  Litoria shrugs.  “I can’t tell you how to teach ‘im.  That’s yer job, weh.  ‘S a lot of responsibility.”  There’s a long pause, while Litoria looks like she’s struggling with something.  She shuffles her feet a bit.</p>
    <p>“Mais...” she sounds unsure of herself, “How far is it?  There’s a celebration, you see, we hol’ it at the star’ ‘a every Summer.  I was hopin’ you could come t’ this’un.”</p>
    <p>Bryti turns to give Litoria a surprised look, “You mean the potluck!? When all of the elves come together? Litoria, I... the fire elves, the blade elves, the crag elves… they would all be there. I… I know you care about me. I know you trust me, but… Litoria, they hate me. I am the enemy to them. If they see me… if they know you are sheltering me… they might go to war. If I go to the potluck, I will be putting your entire flotilla in danger. I would be risking the very future of you and all of your allies. I can’t… I can’t ask you to take that risk, just on the chance that I might be… accepted.”</p>
    <p>“Weh,” Litoria stubbornly chews on her words as she gets them out, “we’re hostin’ this one.  It’s gon’ be at Oarsman’s Rest.  It’s sacred ground t’us.”  She takes a deep breath and continues.  “Accept’d by thems ‘er non, as ‘en Elf yer deservin’ of an invite.  An fer what you did fer us - I want thems t’know whatchu did.  Rapids, Bryti, yer the first beacon a’hope we got ‘gainst the Affliction.  There’s been alchemy makin’ promises of early detection, but we ain’t never had a chance of havin’ it actually reversed b’fore.”</p>
    <p>“An it’s Oarsman’s Rest.  E’en if you skip th’ formal potluck wi’ all the rest, there’s the bonfires on the river an’...”  She trails off momentarily.  “An I wan’ you to git t’ come see th’ memorial there.  We don’ make th’ trip up th’ Goldfall erry year, non?”  Litoria reaches out toward Bryti, as if to hold her hand, and then stops.</p>
    <p>Bryti does not hesitate as she takes Litoria’s hand, “So, you would be willing to allow your people to take that much risk… only because I deserve to be there?”</p>
    <p>“We’re here t’day because you took a risk on us.”  Litoria squeezes the wolf’s hand.  “Weh.  Yes.  You deserve it more’n half’a thems that woul’ deny you.”</p>
    <p>Bryti squeezes back, “Then I will be there. I… will want to talk about it with Staurois, but I will be there. Allophryne and I will have to leave for the Watchtower before the end of the season, but if we move carefully… we should be able to swing back to Oarsman’s Rest in time for the potluck. If… if you really think I deserve to be there, then… I will.”</p>
    <p>“Weh, then I’ll hold you to that.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods, “Please do. Now, tell me when we can eat this pig…” </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Later that evening, after much delicious pork has been consumed, the elf and the werewolf return to Litoria’s raft. Once again, Litoria closes the heavy curtains and starts the steam going on the warm coals. Bryti hangs up her gear and sits down next to Litoria. After finally being able to spend a full day together, they are both in a good mood.</p>
    <p>Bryti gives Litoria a slightly more serious look, “Litoria, there’s something I have to tell you. I… am a werewolf.”</p>
    <p>“Go to bed.  That can’t be right.  You got some kinda gris-gris on you or somethin’.  I ain’t believin’ that, me.”  Litoria maintains a deadpan expression.</p>
    <p>Bryti fails to keep a straight face, “Shocking, I know. I am amazed you can withstand such revelation. I can hardly believe it myself.”</p>
    <p>Bryti’s smile falters slightly, but only just, “Litoria… do you know what it means to me to have a hybrid soul?”</p>
    <p>“I axed my therapist a while back abou’ what it means t’ be en Elf,” Litoria answers in all seriousness, “an accordin’ to our Goddess, what counts is whachu feel.  If’n you feel you’re more ‘en jus’ an elf, that’s got to count too.  So yer an elf <i>and</i> you’re a werewolf.  Am I right, me?”</p>
    <p>Bryti tilts her head, “Sort of. Werewolf is… a term for the whole. I am fully an elf, as much as you are. I’m only now embracing it as much as I should, yes, but it’s true. I am also a wolf, as much as I am an elf. I am wholly both. It is those two combined that make a werewolf, a hybrid soul that is as much wolf as it is elf.” </p>
    <p>Bryti gives Litoria a somewhat fearful but also hopeful look, “So… if you want your life to be a part of mine, if you want to truly know me and accept me… you have to be able to accept the wolf as much as the elf.” </p>
    <p>Litoria fights her panic and masters her facial expressions.  She has joked about the loup garou in her home before, but that was more a hypothetical.  This is somewhat less so.</p>
    <p>“I can’t expec’ that you’ll come here an be magically transformed by eatin’ our food, sleepin’ in our hammocks, an’ adopt all our ways.”  She speaks carefully.  “I hafta change too, to be fair t’ you, me.  Mais, the wolf scares me less ‘en the the thought I might hurt you.”</p>
    <p>From outside, both can hear a low pitched repeated grunting sound.  Sauver may be too large to actually board the raft now, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t get to make her opinions known.</p>
    <p>“Tha’ won’t happen.  I ain’t accidentally strangled Acris in years.”</p>
    <p>Bryti’s smile returns slightly, “I am fairly certain I am harder to strangle than Acris, so that is a good start.” </p>
    <p>She sighs slightly, “I know it’s sudden, and I can’t pretend to know what you have been through, but… this is me. This will always be me. I want… I want me to be a comfort to you, no matter what form I am in.”</p>
    <p>“It’ll take some gettin’ used to,” Litoria confesses, “mais, I can’t expect you t’ want t’ stay if’n this would always be a dam between us, non.  If I ain’t capable a’ learnin’ then I ain’t worth your time.”</p>
    <p>“I trust you,” Bryti says with complete confidence, “And if you weren’t capable of learning, you would have killed me the second time we met. I want to stay.”</p>
    <p>“An’ I hope you can feel a’ home here.”  Litoria pauses, and unbuckles the clasps on her armor.  With the green-tarnished plates removed, wearing the padded gambeson and her soft cloth layers only, she looks diminished, vulnerable, and maybe a bit pudgy instead of being the strong and sturdy military elf she appears most of the time.  “I can change, an’ be changed.  It’s worthwhile, weh?”</p>
    <p>“Absolutely,” Bryti, surprisingly enough, appears to actually be a bit distracted looking at Litoria. She blinks and looks up to Litoria’s face, “Hm. Would it be easier for you to get used to me as just the wolf? Not the, er, big bad Tourist, rampaging werewolf of the bloodline… but just the wolf.”</p>
    <p>“The wolf ain’t so big and bad, weh?”  Litoria gives a shy smile.  “We can try.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods and takes a few steps forward. As she turns to face Litoria, she shifts into her wolf form. Seeing it up close, it’s a strange transition. Seeing such a massive change happen in scarcely the blink of an eye with hardly any more effort than breathing will take some getting used to. It seems such a major change, yet happens so quickly it seems entirely natural.</p>
    <p>Bryti is a large wolf, probably more than two hundred pounds. She has thick fur the same color of white as her hair in elven form. Interestingly, her holy symbol of Luna and the attachments to it remain unchanged around her neck. If that wasn’t enough, the wolf watches Litoria with the same blue eyes that the elf has. She sits still a few feet from Litoria, and makes no sudden movements. The wolf is quiet as it watches Litoria, but her eyes betray a cautious fear.</p>
    <p>Litoria sits on her hands, her back stiff and straight.  She blinks and tries to hold completely still.  No sudden movements. There is a long awkward pause as neither of them moves. After a few minutes of neither side accidentally murdering the other, the wolf tilts her head curiously at Litoria. She briefly pads in a circle, then flops to the ground at Litoria’s feet. Her tail swishes slightly as she looks up at the elf.</p>
    <p>Nervously, Litoria reaches out with one webbed toe and pokes the fluffy wolf.  The fur doesn’t combust at her touch.  Nor does she suffer an instant flashback just at the sensation of fuzz on her toes. The wolf slowly rolls over and sticks all four paws straight up in the air. She sticks out her tongue with an exaggerated <i>bleck</i> noise. After a pause, she relaxes and looks back at Litoria. Litoria now knows that she can still do an eyebrow raise as a wolf.</p>
    <p>Litoria giggles.  She composes herself briefly and assumes a much more serious expression.  This lasts all of half a moment.  She giggles again.</p>
    <p>“You really are still you, weh?”</p>
    <p>The wolf rolls back over. She taps herself with a paw a few times, as if to check. She looks up to Litoria and gives a surprisingly elven nod.</p>
    <p>Still very aware of exactly where her hands are, Litoria slowly relaxes to lean against the wall.  She sighs quietly.</p>
    <p>“What next?” she asks the wolf.</p>
    <p>The wolf looks up at her and swishes her tail thoughtfully. She scoots slightly closer to Litoria. She sits up slightly, then very slowly and very gently rests her rather large head on Litoria's lap. She looks up at Litoria and flicks an ear nervously.</p>
    <p>Moving very slowly, Litoria places one webbed hand on top of Bryti’s head.  This is Bryti, she reminds herself.  I’m not in any danger.  This is Bryti.  The fur is soft, so soft, and dry to the touch.</p>
    <p>Holding back tears makes Litoria’s nose run.  She blushes a deep green in embarrassment. </p>
    <p>Bryti relaxes at Litoria's touch. Litoria can feel the tension leaving the wolf's body. Her jaw relaxes and she leans her weight into Litoria. Bryti's ears relax and tilt slightly to the side. She closes her eyes and makes a slight sniffing sound. Her only movement is her tail swishing gently back and forth.</p>
    <p>Litoria hiccups nervously, and gently, so very gently, strokes the soft fur. The wolf exhales a sigh and tilts her head towards Litoria, leaning into the touch slightly. Even though Litoria’s murderous hands are touching the wolf’s head, her face, her neck, she is still relaxed. She is comfortable. She feels <i>safe</i>.</p>
    <p>Maybe, just maybe, things are going to be okay.</p>
