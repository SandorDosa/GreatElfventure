    <h1>A Course Is Changed</h1>
    <p>The werewolf howls in pain. Litoria twists her spear into the chest of the afflicted with the sound of cracking ribs. The howl is cut short. She watches the fur fall away, replaced with orange skin. The dead hobgoblin goes limp. Litoria pulls her spear free and looks up for the next fallen afflicted.</p>
    <p>All around her, her Crocodilians do the same. Those that are not bandaging and helping carry off their own wounded, of course. They had taken many casualties. Nothing like they had in their past, but more than Litoria had thought. There were so few of them now…</p>
    <p>Before her mind was able to wander, Litoria hears shouting and a clatter nearby. She turns and starts jogging towards it mostly on reflex. She sees several Crocodilians with spears at the ready and one wide eyed Archerfish. They part slightly as Litoria approaches.</p>
    <p>Bryti stands at the center of the group. Litoria has to remind herself several times that it is, in fact Bryti. Litoria had always assumed that Hunger was exaggerating about her hybrid form, but now it looks like he was understating it. Between her nearly eight foot height and the howl that she had heard, Litoria knew that she was a werewolf of the bloodline. That absurd sword looks a little more reasonably sized now.</p>
    <p>At least she wasn’t actually twelve feet tall and breathing ice.</p>
    <p>There is an iron arrow in Bryti’s hand. She tosses it back at the Archerfish with a growl, “You dropped this.”</p>
    <p>The werewolf looks at the awkward group of soldiers around her. She looks over the group then stops when she sees Litora. Her eyes are still the same, still that same elf behind them. Bryti plants the tip of her blood soaked sword on the ground and leans on it heavily.</p>
    <p>“Hello Litoria,” She takes a slow breath, “I suppose I am causing a scene.”</p>
    <p>“Lil’ bit,” the Warmaster answers.  “Migh’ be better if’n ya didn’ have all tha’ fur right abou’ nah.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, I can see the confusion. Moment.”</p>
    <p>Bryti’s shifting is slower, as if it takes more energy than usual for her to do so. When she takes her elven form, she leans on her sword even more and apparently has to catch her breath for a moment. Her face seems gaunt and her skin paler than last time Litoria saw her, and her clothes are ragged and covered in dust and dried mud. She doesn’t appear injured, but seems much worse for the wear.</p>
    <p>“Better?” Her eyes are still bright as she gives the soldiers around her a level look.</p>
    <p>The soldiers give a general shrug and return to their work. Bryti sits down heavily. She crosses her legs and places the sword on her lap. She takes a piece of cloth out of her bag and begins the slow process of cleaning the blood off of her sword. She does so very respectfully.</p>
    <p>“I apologize,” She speaks to Litoria, “I did not think about what that looked like. After what they saw, I imagine I must seem quite terrible to y- to them.”</p>
    <p>Litoria steals a measured look at the blade elf that just saved their most precious secret from certain destruction.  It’s hard to reconcile the monstrous wolf with the woman in front of her.  But, there’s no denying it.  She swallows her fear.</p>
    <p>“You do look terrible.”  Litoria offers Bryti a webbed hand.  “You need ta’ see a medic en git yerself somethin ta’ eat.”  She gestures toward the riverbank, from which she so recently sprung an ambush.  “Smilisca’ll be over thataways distributin’ the wolfsbane - he ken fix you up somethin’ ta eat.  I’ve gotta help finish this.”</p>
    <p>Bryti finishes wiping the last of the blood out of the runes and returns the sword to its sheath. She shoulders it and takes Litoria’s hand to stand up. Litoria can’t help but notice she seems a little lighter than last time she helped her up. Bryti steadies herself on Litoria’s shoulder for a moment before standing.</p>
    <p>“Not yet,” she shakes her head, “There are many who need help more than I do. I can help with the wounded.”</p>
    <p>She frowns, “And my work is not done yet. Yes, I think I will go see Smilisca.”</p>
    <p>Litoria nods and gets back to the gruesome task of slaughtering every last one of the Afflicted barbarian horde.</p>
    <p>When Bryti reaches the riverbank, she finds Smilisca standing with Sauver, the hippopotamus, distributing little packets of herbs to the wounded lining up on the bank.  Every injured river elf, no matter how small or insignificant the damage, accepts the poisonous packet from their resident wizard.</p>
    <p>Bryti approaches him quietly, watching him distribute wolfsbane to the wounded.</p>
    <p>“I have some healer’s training,” she gives him a polite nod, “and a little bit of magic left. If they would accept it, I can offer help.”</p>
    <p>Smilisca eyes her somewhat skeptically.  Even to his untrained eyes, this werewolf’s not looking so great herself right about now.  She’s almost listing to one side.</p>
    <p>“Good - ‘cause I don’.”  He nods, thinking of how useful it would have been to have Staurois or Eina right about now.  Magic healing granted by the divine spirits themselves is always better than a regular bandage.  “Tha military’s self-triagin’ fer the most par’.  Star’ wi’ the worst bit if’n ya ken spell ‘em from bleedin’ out.”</p>
    <p>“I most certainly can,” she looks to the injured, “Smilisca… When all the wounded are accounted for and everyone has had their wolfsbane please let me know.”</p>
    <p>Smilisca nods, and gets back to work.</p>
    <p>Bryti glances at him before she turns away, “... and it’s good to see you.”</p>
    <p>Without anything else said, she turns to aid the wounded. She finds the closest medic and enlists herself. They are a little surprised by her offer at first, but as they realize she is currently acting more like a blade elf soldier than a towering imperious werewolf noble they decide they can work with her. Bryti allows the medics to direct her where she is most needed. The medics seem surprised by it, but she takes their orders without question.</p>
    <p>They make good use of her. Even a single divine caster with <i>stabilize</i> prepared can save many lives in a busy triage, and the medics are dealing with more wounded than expected. She still has a few low level healing spells left, so once the most critical patients are out of danger she sets herself to taking the edge off some of the worst injured so that traditional healers may do their jobs. Once she has run out of magic, she uses traditional healing skills. She seems to only have basic training, less than a true medic, but applies it well.</p>
    <p>Oddly, as the casualties and triage roll in, she seems to start fitting in. Her bedside manner is terse and businesslike, but no one is here to make friends. After the first few hours of triage, she is moving shoulder to shoulder with the river elf medics like she belongs there.</p>
    <p>Eventually, all of the wounded are accounted for. There’s no one left on death’s door, she’s out of her healing spells, and her basic healing skills aren’t what’s needed at this point. One of the medics point blank orders her to take a break before she ends up on one of the stretchers.</p>
    <p>Bryti obeys this command without complaint. She returns to Smilisca and sits next to him. She sits on the ground and takes a battered canteen out of her bag. She sips water slowly. She is clearly exhausted to the point of collapse, but there is still something in her eyes. She looks over the wounded with a cool determination.</p>
    <p>“Is that all of them?” she asks Smilisca.</p>
    <p>Smilisca has given the wolfsbane to each and every one of the wounded, even those with the tiniest insignificant injuries that require no treatment at all.  Even the one Archerfish that took a misfired arrow to the leg from his comrade behind him gets the poison.  They take the leaves directly, chewing the bitter herb until the initial burn wears off and it numbs their tongue.  With everyone thus drugged, none of the river elves has to feel singled out.  Smilisca looks at the much reduced quantity of herbs left in Sauver’s packs, and nods.  Litoria returns from her grisly chore and washes her hands of blood in the river, leaning heavily on the hippopotamus.</p>
    <p>“Then I have work to do.” Bryti returns her waterskin to her bag and slowly stands.</p>
    <p>She gives Smilisca a sideways look, “Just trust me.”</p>
    <p>Bryti takes a few steadying breaths and closes her eyes. When she opens them, the whites of her eyes have turned a vibrant blue and they give off a slight glow. She strides forward purposefully, heading towards the ranks of wounded.</p>
    <p>Silently, she walks between the ranks of wounded. She gives each and every one of them a long stare before moving on. This draws some attention as she goes. The medics who had worked with her now look a little more concerned, and one or two are following her.</p>
    <p>Litoria picks up her giggin’ stick and follows, suspicious.</p>
    <p>When Litoria approaches, Bryti stops and looks back at her. She has a serious expression on her face. She does not say anything, and instead resumes her walk through the wounded.</p>
    <p>As she comes to one of the wounded Crocodilians she stops. Her eyes narrow momentarily and she frowns. The expression disappears after only a brief moment. She kneels next to him and looks him over. His shoulder is bandaged. Small points of blood can be seen in the thin fabric, in the unmistakable outline of a bite wound. She gives the wound a grim look, then turns to him.</p>
    <p>“What is your name, soldier?”</p>
    <p>“Allophryne Allophrynidae,” His voice is ragged, but strong.</p>
    <p>She nods to him and speaks quietly, only enough for those very close by to hear, “Allophryne Allophrynidae, you are afflicted.”</p>
    <p>Allophryne’s eyes go wide. He looks from Bryti to Litoria, confused.</p>
    <p>Litoria’s heart skips a beat.  Is it actually possible to detect the Affliction before the victim shifts under the full moon?  This would be such a great gift - a chance to say goodbye before the execution.  She also turns to look at Bryti, astonished.</p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Dit mon la verite'<span class="tooltiptext">Tell me the truth</span></span>,” Litoria exhales slowly, her grey skin blanching pale with shock.</p>
    <p>Bryti looks back at Litoria and simply nods. She turns back to Allophryne and gives him a serious look.</p>
    <p>“Do not move.”</p>
    <p>She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. She begins to chant in  Skaplyndi. The sound of that language causes many nearby elves to take note of what is happening. Bryti places her hands together and with a few gestures traces runes on her palms. They begin to glow as she opens her eyes.</p>
    <p>She places one hand on the injury on Allophryne’s shoulder, then traces another rune on top of the injury. The rune illuminates over the injury and she draws her hands back slowly. There is a low hum. Points of darkness slowly appear through the bandage, seeping through. A substance like oily smoke slowly seeps out of the wound. Allophryne winces, but doesn’t move. Bryti begins to chant louder, and the smoke like substance begins to pour out of the injury.</p>
    <p>The dark smoke roils upwards and takes a form that looks like a wolf. Bryti jumps to standing and grabs the smoky form around the neck. The runes she traced on her hands begin to flare with light. She pulls upwards, drawing the spectral wolf out of Allophryne.</p>
    <p>The affliction growls in a distorted voice. Bryti grimaces and does not let go. As the last wisps of smoke leave Allophryne’s wound, she clamps down around the thing. It yelps in pain as its smoky form is drawn towards her hands. She clamps down hard as the wolf is drawn between her waiting palms.</p>
    <p>The Purifier opens one of her hands slowly. There is a small black sphere in it, about the size of a marble. She gives it a look of disgust.</p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Hefja blót,<span class="tooltiptext">To sacrifice a Heathen in the name of Luna</span></span>” she snarls at it in Skaplyndi.</p>
    <p>She clamps her hand down on it. There is a sound like shattering glass. She opens her hand and a few small wisps of smoke evaporate.</p>
    <p>Bryti falls down to a knee panting. She takes a few moments to compose herself before turning to Allophryne.</p>
    <p>“It’s gone,” She gives him a half smile, “Get some rest, Allophryne. Your people will need you again.”</p>
    <p>She pauses to catch her breath.</p>
    <p>Litoria’s eyes are as wide and round as the full moon itself.  It could be an illusion.  This could all be false.  But no, she’s seen illusions.  And Allophryne clearly felt something.  This magic, whatever it was, is real.</p>
    <p>“Gone,” Allophryne repeats, incredulous, and looks to his Warmaster.</p>
    <p>“She wouldn’t lie.”  Litoria isn’t sure if she’s answering the Crododilian’s question or her own.  She is, however, absolute in her certainty.  No decent person would lie about the Affliction.  And Bryti is, most definitely, someone with a core of goodness.  She kneels beside the soldier.  “If’n she says it’s cured, en it is.”</p>
    <p>"Trust is not necessary," Bryti states, "It is gone. That is all that matters."</p>
    <p>Bryti stands unsteadily. She resumes her walk down the row of wounded, examining them steadily.  Her steps are uneven, however, and she begins to sway. A few paces further down she stumbles. Litoria realizes she is about to collapse from exhaustion.</p>
    <p>Litoria reacts decisively.  She hands her weapon to a medic and moves to catch the exhausted Lycan. She manages to loop an arm in front of her as she begins to fall. The elf stumbles and leans her weight into Litoria. It is no difficulty for Litoria to bear her weight, and she steadies her.</p>
    <p>As she regains her bearing, Bryti gives Litoria's arms and hands a confused look. She looks conflicted, but does not push away. She drapes an arm over Litoria's shoulders for support.</p>
    <p>"I…" Bryti searches for words, "I am not done yet. There are more who may be afflicted. I… I can still… I can't just stop."</p>
    <p>Her eyes still have the blue glow, but up close Litoria can see the elf she knows behind them. She is not well. She is still looking forward to the wounded, but it is clear she can't even stand. </p>
    <p>"Not done…" She mutters under her breath.</p>
    <p>“You need to rest, cher.  You ain’t no help to nobody if you done work yoself <span class="tooltip">Defante<span class="tooltiptext">Dear departed sainted woman</span></span>.”  Seeing that there’s some resistance left in the other elf, Litoria gets a better purchase on her, lifts with her knees, and picks her up. </p>
    <p>"You can't just -" she starts to protest, but then falls silent as she is lifted, "Oh."</p>
    <p>Litoria feels tension in the other elf's body and prepares for her to try to break free. After a few moments of being carried, though, she relaxes and allows herself to be carried.</p>
    <p>The Warmaster carries the Lycan to where camp has been set up while the wounded are being treated.  She finds her an empty tent and makes space for the elf to sleep.</p>
    <p>As Litoria sets her down to arrange the tent, Bryti slumps to a relaxed seated position. She looks up at Litoria. Her eyes have lost the glow and she looks like a normal elf again.</p>
    <p>"That was very demeaning," she says with some of her sense of humor returning to her voice, "What will they think of the big bad wolf now?"</p>
    <p>“Tha Loup Garou gon’ blow yo raft upstream wi’er snores I hopes, me.”  Litoria passes her a blanket.  More seriously then, “There’ll be more ta do when ya wake, weh?”</p>
    <p>Bryti takes the blanket with a bewildered look, “I can… stay? Even though everyone knows what I am? Your soldiers hate me…”</p>
    <p>“Bryti,” Litoria answers, “you don’ have a choice nah.  Ya fought.  Tha’ means you’re stuck here till af’er the full moon.  Erryone who fights gotta stay.  Mais, when some’un turns we ‘gon need that sword a yers.”</p>
    <p>Bryti gives Litoria a quiet look. Litoria is beginning to know her well enough to recognize deep sadness on her face.</p>
    <p>“That is how you handle the affliction?” She asks, “As a group, together? Everyone who fought?” </p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria nods.  “<i>Erryone.</i>  We don’ have a way t’detec’ it.  All we ken do is take the ‘bane en pray.  When s’un turns, the rest ‘a their division’s there t’ make sure the Affliction don’ spread.”</p>
    <p>Bryti closes her eyes and lowers her head.</p>
    <p>“An egalitarian method,” her voice is quiet, “I can’t take back the horrors we visited upon you, but if you would have me here… I can protect you from our death throes. No one deserves the curse we give them. We have… a bit less than a week before the full moon. I can strip the curse away, a few at a time, every day. Not many, but if everyone took their wolfsbane and there are not too many who were bitten… it may be enough.”</p>
    <p>She pauses before finishing, “No one ever deserved to bear the affliction. I won’t let it fall on you and yours.”</p>
    <p>“Mais la!  E’en jus one less ta turn is a big big help.”  Litoria closes the tent flap, making sure that there is quiet enough for sleep.  “Rest nah, you gon’ need it.”</p>
    <p>"I… will," she sets her sword aside and fiddles with the catch on her breastplate, "Could you help me with this? My fingers do not seem to obey me…"</p>
    <p>The last time Litoria removed a werewolf’s mithril breastplate was to steal it from their corpse.  If she hesitates to banish the visceral memory before helping, it is not very long.</p>
    <p>As Litoria helps her remove the armor, the Lycan's exhaustion becomes even more apparent. Even though she’s sitting down, she is swaying. When the last of the straps are undone, Litora sets the armor aside. As she turns back, she feels a weight on her shoulder. Bryti has leaned her head onto her.</p>
    <p>“I missed…” Bryti mumbles with her eyes closed, “Staying with you…”</p>
    <p>Before Litoria can respond to that statement, she realizes that Bryti is breathing with a slow, steady cadence. She has fallen asleep. </p>
    <p>Litoria’s mind is completely blank for a moment.  If someone had said, just a few months ago, that she would have a werewolf seeking comfort from resting on her shoulder she would have called them a liar.  And surprisingly, she is okay with this.  Maybe more than okay with this.  This is okay.  It might even be nice.  It’s been a long time.</p>
    <p>It seems like a really bad idea to wake the sleeping wolf.  Litoria loathes the idea of disturbing her at all.  She lets the werewolf rest there until she starts to lose feeling in her arm.  Unfortunately, though, she still has work to do.  A lot of work to do.  This will have to wait.  Litora wiggles out from under Bryti’s weight and gently rests her head back on the pallet.</p>
    <p>Just outside the tent, she runs into Allophryne.</p>
    <p>“Mais, is she is already asleep?” he asks, looking deflated.  The Crocodilian has a basket of spring rolls in his hands, the usual food of the river elf army on the march.</p>
    <p>Litoria only nods, keeping quiet even though she’s certain that she’d have to march a behemoth through the tent to wake Bryti now.  Allophryne’s disappointment is obvious.  Even his ears droop dramatically.  He’s clearly short on self-control at the moment.  </p>
    <p>“She oughta eat though,” he protests, holding out the basket, “our wolf lookin’ too too tin.”</p>
    <p>“En you’re gon’ make sure she does.”  Litoria pats him on the shoulder, carefully avoiding the side still bandaged from his bite.  “Stan’ guard so nowhat else ken bother her.”</p>
    <p>And with Allophryne grinning at her, Litoria gets back to work.  Military cleanup operations take a lot of organizational effort, and they have corpses to burn.</p>
    <p>Allophryne watches the Warmaster walk back towards the battlefield to begin the grim work. It has to be done, but he is glad to be standing here instead of taking part. Even though afflicted lose their shape when they die, it's still possible to pass the affliction. That doesn't make piling corpses into a pyre any more bearable.</p>
    <p>The camp workers and uninjured soldiers go about their task with practiced efficiency, but it is still hours before they have gathered enough wood and moved the bodies for the pyres. There are many bodies, but few there to move them. By the time they are ready to light, the sun has nearly set.</p>
    <p>Allophryne shudders as he watches the pyres light. There are only about a dozen this time, but the sight reminds him of the aftermath of Skaplyndi. There, the fires had reached out to the horizon. At least he is upwind. The smell might be too much.</p>
    <p>There is a rustling noise in the tent. A few moments later, the wolf opens the flap and steps out. The sun has set and she is mostly illuminated by the red light of the fires, but the flickering light only makes her clearly exhausted face look more so.</p>
    <p>The wolf stands next to Allophryne and watches the fires silently for a few moments. She turns her head slowly towards him and sniffs. Her eyes drop to the basket.</p>
    <p>"I hope some of that is for me," she speaks in a ragged voice, "And didn't I tell you to get some rest?"</p>
    <p>Allophryne holds the basket toward her with his good arm.</p>
    <p>“Dis is rest, weh.”  He gives her a grim smile.  “I ain’t o’er thataways.”  A glance indicates the burning fires.</p>
    <p>The wolf takes the offered basket with a quiet "Thank you."</p>
    <p>She sits down slowly with crossed legs and takes one of the rolls. She eats slowly, taking modest bites and pausing between them to sip from her canteen. She watches the fires burn quietly and does not speak for some time.</p>
    <p>"I suppose I cannot judge," she finally says as she turns her head to Allophryne, "There is something I need to do. I… hope it does not offend you."</p>
    <p>The wolf reaches under her ragged black clothing and removes something shiny. It is a mithral holy symbol of Luna, with five iron beads tied into the leather cord that holds it around her neck. She lifts it off of her neck and holds it gently in her palms. She bows her head towards the fire and begins to quietly pray.</p>
    <p>Allophryne sits down next to her and observes the moment of silence.  He contemplates the grace required to show compassion for the Afflicted, and recalls that if not for that intervention, someone would be mourning his burning corpse on the next full moon.  There, but by the permission of Luna lie other men.  He waits while a thought crystalizes in the back of his mind.</p>
    <p>"I hate the affliction," she speaks as she raises her head, "Not the afflicted. They are victims of my people's folly. I pray that their souls may be free from our curse, so that they may be able to reach whatever afterlife may await."</p>
    <p>“Dis weren’t my firs’ bite.”  Allophryne rolls up his shorts a bit to show a set of teeth marks on his thigh.  Bryti recognizes that their pattern as definitely not having come from a wolf.  “En it migh’ no be my las’ if’n things don’ change, non?”</p>
    <p>“There are more of em, weh?  En more like me who’ll still Change on the moon, weh?”</p>
    <p>Bryti takes another roll out of the basket. She eats it slowly, delaying her answer. She simply watches the flames. Allophryne does not press. It can't be an easy question. She finishes it before answering.</p>
    <p>"As long as there are lycanthropes, there will be the affliction," she states in a quiet voice.</p>
    <p>"As far as today… I will be staying until the full moon. Doubtlessly, there are others among your comrades who now carry the affliction. I will do everything in my power to ensure that they are saved before that full moon rises. If there is strength enough in me, I will not allow the curse to visit your people this time."</p>
    <p>Allophryne sits on that thought, and steals one of the spring rolls.  He bites through the thin wrapper and crunches on the onion and shellfish within.  It’s been a long day.  He’s got a lot on his mind.</p>
    <p>“You need anything else?” he asks, gesturing at the mostly empty basket.  “I ken get more, or grab somethin’ ta drink.”</p>
    <p>She nods, “Yes, if you could bring some fresh water I would appreciate it. Thank you for bringing food, Allophryne. I have not eaten in several days. It is hard to sleep on an empty stomach, and I must rest to regain my strength. There is much to do tomorrow.”</p>
    <p>Obediently, Allophryne fetches the requested water.  He runs into Litoria on the way back and they have a brief discussion of when, exactly, he plans to actually sleep.  Eventually, she gives in to his demands.</p>
    <p>When Bryti wakes up in the morning, she finds Allophryne asleep on a mat just outside the tent, with a fat, ugly one-eyed alligator flopped next to him.  The gator has a protective claw draped over the elf’s arm.  Litoria sits a short distance away, checking the silversheen on her viciously barbed spear.</p>
    <p>Bryti exits the tent with all of her gear in place and her sword shouldered. She looks better than she did last night, but is still quite clearly worn down. She has made a basic effort to make herself presentable, but very much looks worn and dirty from her long ordeal.</p>
    <p>Regardless, there is confidence in her posture once again. She is steady on her feet and standing tall. She looks between Allophryne and Litoria, then raises an eyebrow.</p>
    <p>"I haven't needed guards outside my bedroom since I was a youth," she comments, "but thank you. Good morning."</p>
    <p>“‘S more fer his sake ‘en yours.”  Litoria speaks quietly, gesturing toward the sleeping Crocodilian and his companion.  “Mais ‘e wants to feel useful, but on restricted duty et’s hard.  If’n there’s anythin’ you need, just say et and he’ll help.  Gits him outa regular tasks fer now."</p>
    <p>Bryti gives the sleeping Crocodilian a curious look, "Well, he will have to keep up. There is still much I need to do. I would like to return to the wounded as soon as I can, so that I can finish my account of how many are afflicted, then I can…"</p>
    <p>She pauses, then sits next to Litoria, "It… can wait a few more minutes. Allophryne deserves his rest, with what he endured yesterday. I will have to get something to eat first anyway. Purging the affliction takes energy, no matter how I do it."</p>
    <p>"It… has been a long time since I saved anyone," she speaks quietly, and only to Litoria, "I had forgotten how it feels."</p>
    <p>“Looks like you’ll git plein’d opportunity if’n you stay here long.”  The Warmaster finishes her morning ritual weapon’s check.  “Mais, <span class="tooltip">jamais d'la vie.<span class="tooltiptext">Never in my life</span></span>  I never though’ t’were possible whatchu did fer Allophryne.  En you say you ken do it again?  Yer like a freshwater spring in a saltwater swamp you are.”</p>
    <p>“I’ve an <span class="tooltip">envie<span class="tooltiptext">craving</span></span> fer somethin fillin’.  Lemee go see what this shift’s got for breakfast, weh?”  Litoria stands and starts toward the camp’s food preparation area.</p>
    <p>"Hm," Bryti hums, "That's the best idea I've heard all day, I'll-"</p>
    <p>Bryti turns towards Allophryne. The alligator next to him gives her an extremely suspicious sideways glare with its single remaining eye. She hesitates.</p>
    <p>"- will let him get his rest."</p>
    <p>Bryti gives the gator a sharp bow, then turns to follow Litoria. </p>
    <p>Walking through the camp, the Warmaster and the Werewolf see the sleepy soldiers trading shifts.  Watch ends, breakfast begins, and the scattered camp hums with activity.  Litoria leads her past the space claimed by the medics, where plenty of wounded still wait to heal.</p>
    <p>They approach the food preparation area, where Smilisca is taking stock of their supplies and making certain that everyone is fed.  The Navigator is busy at work on the many tasks he has as the logistical officer for the river elf army on the march.  Or the paddle, as it were.</p>
    <p>Beached kayaks line the riverbank, among them are several longer boats with outrigger stabilizing floats.  Dozens of alligators lurk in the churned muddy river water, visible only where their snouts break the waves.  The Crocodilian namesake makes their campsite a dangerous place to wander uncarefully.</p>
    <p>Litoria requisitions a meal for them both - rice with fish and green shoots.  Smilisca pegs his cousin with a thrown orange as she’s headed away with the food.  He scowls at her as she gives him a dirty look.</p>
    <p>Bryti stays quiet for most of breakfast, but does take an offered orange quite happily. She seems lost in thought for most of the morning, and Litoria decides it’s best not to bother her. Still a distinctive figure, she gathers more strange looks from the assembled river elves. They may have heard rumors of what she did for Allophryne and the wounded, but even with that the sight of a werewolf sitting down to eat breakfast with their Warmaster is bizarre.</p>
    <p>The looks don’t seem to phase her. She finishes every scrap of food she is given. Once she and the Warmaster have finished their meals, she turns to Litoria.</p>
    <p>“I’m ready,” she finally says, “Let us go to the wounded.”</p>
    <p>Litoria nods, still nibbling her way through the orange begrudgingly.  She leads the way back to where the medics are keeping the worst of the wounded.</p>
    <p>“Them’s ambulatory will be on their shifts,” she explains, “Weh, I know, it don’ take a big injury to get the Affliction, bu’ we ain’t got ‘nuff hands to go round to jus’ let everyone off th’ hook since we don’ know who’s got it an who don’.”</p>
    <p>Bryti rubs her chin, but nods, “Then we will do what we can when we can. We will take those that are in the field hospital first. I will heal the afflicted as I find them. I am sure there will be more there than I can save in one day.”</p>
    <p>She gives Litoria a level look, thinking for several moments before speaking, “There is no limit on how long I can watch for the affliction. However, I only have the strength to cure four per day. We have five days until the full moon. As long as it’s fewer than twenty…”</p>
    <p>She shakes her head, “I’m sure you have a duty roster. We will check everyone.”  </p>
    <p>“Calestros preserve,” Litoria whispers in a reverent hush.  “A miracle done more en once is still a miracle.  We’ll make sure erryone comes to see you, weh.”</p>
    <p>Bryti pauses again at Litoria’s words, but only replies “Good.”</p>
    <p>They reach the field hospital quickly. The medics respond a bit more favorably to Bryti this time. She resumes her vigil, walking among the wounded and looking for afflicted. As she said, it does not take her terribly long to go through her four spells. It is slightly less dramatic this time, but only slightly. It may have gotten away from her a little bit last time, as she was so exhausted. Once those four are complete, she continues.</p>
    <p>When she finds more who are afflicted after that, she kneels next to them. She quietly explains what has happened, and promises that she will be back to help them. If they permit her, she says a prayer to Luna for them to give them strength until she returns. A few of them accept. As she reaches the end of that group, Litoria brings back the first group of on-duty soldiers who were wounded.</p>
    <p>Litoria slowly cycles through the on-duty wounded, giving each of them a shift guarding the field hospital. This allows Bryti to slowly work through the duty roster while also giving her time to use her lesser healing magic helping the more traditionally wounded.</p>
    <p>Around lunch, Litoria has reached the end of her lists. Many names have circles next to them. Bryti glances over Litoria’s shoulder to see that they have completed their task. She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath in, then releases it.</p>
    <p>“I have been counting,” she speaks, “Fourteen. Counting the ones I saved today.”</p>
    <p>She opens her eyes, and a tension is removed from her voice, “I will be enough.”</p>
    <p>The words echo in Litoria’s mind, it takes her a moment to process exactly what that means for the Angry Alligators as a division, for the river elves as a people.  She can’t think of anything to say to that.</p>
    <p>But she reaches out and takes the werewolf’s calloused hand in her own webbed one.  And she stands in silence, just expressing thanks. Bryti glances down at the gesture in surprise, but allows her hand to be held. She looks back to Litoria as if to say something, but is clearly also having trouble finding words.</p>
    <p>Instead of saying anything, she simply returns the gesture and holds Litoria’s hand. Whatever else has happened to this werewolf, an event like this clearly has not. Like Litoria, Bryti seems to be processing what this might mean. For the moment, it seems to be accepting comfort.</p>
    <p>“In honesty,” Bryti finally speaks, “I am amazed that you want to be anywhere near me right now. I… could probably use some freshening up. I feel more like a tumbleweed than an elf. Would you mind lending me some clothes so that I could get myself and my clothes cleaned up?”</p>
    <p>Litoria nods, and gestures toward where Allophryne is sitting on his ugly alligator, waiting to be useful.</p>
    <p>“He’ll fix you up,” she says, “Take yerself a bath while yer at it, weh?  Allophryne ken git you some soap.”  Litoria heads off to go find some spare clothes that will fit the werewolf, leaving her with the Crocodilian.</p>
    <p>Bryti turns and raises an eyebrow at Allophryne with a slight smile, "Soap?"</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>After several hours, the camp has fallen into good order. Scouts indicate that there are no further enemies in the area, so it should be safe to remain here until the full moon instead of risking moving the wounded. The field hospital is stable, and the scouts have found enough food sources to feed the camp for a few days. Smilisca has the logistics down, and the experienced Crocodilians have helped the newer Archerfish refine their campcraft. The camp has hit the point where it is relatively self sufficient, and Litoria’s duties as Warmaster are done for the day.</p>
    <p>There has been a great deal of curiosity among the river elves about the wolf, and what exactly she is up to. There is less outright suspicion than there was before. She was an essential aid on the battlefield, and she aided the wounded without question even though she was about to drop. The stories about her curing the afflicted are wild, though, and many don’t even believe them. Many keep trying to catch a glimpse of her or watch what she is doing. Litoria has given explicit orders to give her space. It’s mostly followed.</p>
    <p>As the day is winding down and Litoria grabs herself a few rolls for dinner, she finds herself headed back over towards her wolf’s tent. She finds Bryti and Allophryne both there. Allophryne is sitting on his alligator and munching his dinner while Bryti is furiously running through her hair with her expensive looking comb. Bryti has gotten herself cleaned up and looks more like herself, aside from the fact that she is wearing Litoria’s clothes. </p>
    <p>Litoria realizes that her clothes are somewhat loose on the werewolf. Now that she is wearing the shorter river elf attire instead of her heavy black clothes, Litoria can see just how much thinner Bryti is than she remembers. The drive was clearly hard on her, but her confident posture still makes her look strong.</p>
    <p id="i">Wait, am I staring?</p>
    <p>Bryti looks up as Litoria approaches and gives a surprisingly genuine smile.</p>
    <p>“Hello Litoria,” Bryti waves as she approaches, “I have to say, river elf soap is good for the skin. Honestly, so are the clothes. I feel like I must have been wearing a blanket with all those black clothes I’ve been wearing…”</p>
    <p>Bryti continues to try to forcibly assert her will on her mangled hair.</p>
    <p>Litoria holds out a hand in a wordless offer of help. Bryti huffs slightly, but relents. She quietly passes the gold and mithril comb to Litoria.  Litoria takes the offered comb and kneels behind her, slowly working out the tangles.</p>
    <p>“I seen how dem Blade Elves braid their hair before.  If’n you wants I ken try’t do somethin similar fer ya, weh?”</p>
    <p>Bryti sits quietly while Litoria works. When she asks her question, she pauses before answering.</p>
    <p> “Yes,” she speaks in a surprisingly soft voice, “I… would very much like that.”</p>
    <p>Litoria is not, perhaps, the best person in camp to ask to do anything particularly detailed with her webbed hands, any of the Archerfish could probably do a better job, but she’s not entirely incompetent either.  She combs Bryti’s hair out straight and then braids it into a simple single plait, tied off with a short leather strand.  It’s nothing like the fancier braids some of the Blade Elves favor, but it keeps long hair contained and out of the way.</p>
    <p>The braid may be simple, but Bryti appears to have no issues with that. When Litoria finishes, Bryti runs a hand along the braid and gives it a long look with a distant expression on her face. She places it in front of her shoulder.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” she nods, “It reminds me of home.”</p>
    <p>Litoria and Allophryne nod understandingly.</p>
    <p>“It’s good to know yer source.”  Allophryne gives her a hopeful smile.  “Tha’ headwaters make us who we are.”</p>
    <p>"Even when they are far behind us," Bryti returns the smile slightly, "I think I like thinking of it that way."</p>
    <p>"Weh. En water don' flow uphill."  Allophryne runs a gentle thumb over the obese gator's scarred hide.  "How you end up learnin to do whatchu do?  What sorta spring's that come from?"</p>
    <p>Litoria listens with interest.</p>
    <p>Bryti shakes her head, “It is hard to explain. For me, for any of us… it was a calling. Small things, dreams, a vision once or twice. The largest part, though, was an understanding. A knowledge that there was something that I <i>needed</i> to be doing. A feeling that I had a purpose, even if I did not fully know what it was. Every Lycan knows about the affliction, for me… I knew that I had to fight it, somehow, even though I did not understand what that meant.”</p>
    <p>She pauses briefly before continuing, “I was young. I told my mother about the dreams, about the strange feeling I had. She told me about the Sacred Purifiers. There was an order of us, though they are gone now. Secret. The order gave me oaths to swear, secrets to keep, trained me in many things, but in truth?”</p>
    <p>She unbuckles her holy symbol from around her neck and holds it in her hands, “Whatever the order was, it was not what truly made me a Purifier. The heart of it, the parts of it that really mattered, were always between me and Mother Luna. I asked her. She answered.” </p>
    <p>"So when'r you gonna start teachin' new folks?  Ain't never gonna be an end to the Affliction.  You can't kill everyone since ya can't find em all. An ya ain't gonna murder no regular Lycans to really end it fer good, no?"  Allophryne looks hopefully toward the werewolf.</p>
    <p>A pained expression crosses Bryti’s face, “I… can’t.”</p>
    <p>"Mais, not at all?  The old channel's cut deep, but I done hoped..."  Allophryne trails off.  Litoria gives him a sideways glance.</p>
    <p>Bryti shakes her head and speaks with genuine pain in her voice, “Luna… she no longer speaks to me. There was a time when I could hear her, gently in my dreams, but not any more. I have failed her. I… must have some purpose left, as I still have the powers she granted me, but the stars only guide me from one group of afflicted to the next. I failed her. There are no more Purifiers left, no more Lycans. None who would want to follow Luna. So, I will do my best to erase our burden from your world. I won’t let that be the last trace left of us. I will keep fighting it until the end, and maybe it will be enough for forgiveness.”</p>
    <p>She exhales through her clenched teeth, “Then, Allophryne, it will be ended for good.”</p>
    <p>The three elves sit in silence a moment.</p>
    <p>"You ain't gonna have to do this without help nah, non?" Litoria quietly reminds the beleaguered warrior.  "Mais we threw in with you now.  You have are support."</p>
    <p>"An Calestros won't shut up."  Allophryne shrugs.  Litoria looks to him with some surprise, but opts not to press.</p>
    <p>Bryti lifts her head slightly and turns from Litoria to Allophryne with a curious look on her face, “You both have a people left. Have futures, and families. I couldn’t possibly ask you to risk that for my doomed quest. I… I am… I was glad that you came, as there was no way I could have stopped this on my own, and I am glad that your homes are safe, but I can’t… It’s…”</p>
    <p>She stumbles over her words and stops.</p>
    <p>“It is nice not to be alone.”</p>
    <p>"Et is, weh."  Litoria leans toward Bryti and their shoulders touch.</p>
    <p>"Cousine," Allophryne says with a lopsided joking grin, "you ain't gettin off that easy.  What of your other people then?  Is you is or is you ain't an elf?  We cousins ain't goin nowhere fer a damn long time.  Jus ask Calestros Himself 'bout that longevity thang.”</p>
    <p>Bryti leans into Litoria’s comforting touch slightly with a contemplative look on her face.</p>
    <p>“Perhaps… perhaps you have a point. I am an elf, even terrible at it as I am. The last thing I want is for danger to visit… my people on account of my failures,” she closes her eyes, “or my pride. I am merely one. I cannot tackle a curse by an insane evil goddess on my own, and… no matter what I believe, it will continue once I am gone.”</p>
    <p>She sighs, “But what can I do? Any Lycans who may yet live have fled far beyond where I can reach them, and… Luna... “</p>
    <p>"You sure it's gotta be Lycans who keep that tradition alive, you?"  Allophryne shrugs when Litoria gives him another sharp look.  "'S abou' time Blinkin retires, en I need to pay back a balance I owe fer this third chance..."</p>
    <p>“Allophryne…” Bryti gives him a level look, “What are you asking me?”</p>
    <p>"Whatchu think?  I get pestered by my God wi vague encouragements an shiftin current metaphors.  An I hears you're needin someone to carry on the tradition hereabouts when you ain't around cause yours done pointed you elsewhere a while. So I'm axin you to teach me to do what you do.  Cause you gave me a third chance an I ain't wastin it.  I need to, me."  His webbed hands ball into fists on his knees.</p>
    <p>“Gods are mad <span class="tooltip">folle<span class="tooltiptext">crazy (feminine)</span></span>…” Bryti repeats quietly, “Allophryne… being a Purifier is a difficult and lonely path. Each Purifier walks their own road, and each one of ours is different. It is always difficult, painful, and dangerous. Much would be asked of you, and I have no idea what it would be like to do so when you are not a Lycan. You would always be apart from other elves, in a way.”</p>
    <p>She takes a breath, “If it is your calling, then none of that can stop you. If it is true, then I am not the one to ask. I can help you, yes, and teach you in some ways, but I can only support. I cannot set you on the path. Only Mother Luna can. You will have to ask Her.”</p>
    <p>"Aight," Allophryne says, with a determined sense of finality.</p>
    <p>Litoria gives him a questioning glance.  "Are you sure bout this?"</p>
    <p>"Sure as current," Allophryne answers.</p>
    <p>“Then when you next see Her,” Bryti responds, “Ask. You see Her every night, and She sees you. I will craft a holy symbol for you, though it will be crude it may help. Ask every night until you receive an answer, whatever form it may take and however long it may be. It was years for me. Regardless, eventually, you will know what the answer is.”</p>
    <p>“Mais la, it’ll be a trade ‘en.”  Allophryne thumbs through the folds of the sling that’s supposed to be keeping his arm immobilized while the shoulder heals.  He pulls out a well-worn and heavily tarnished copper pin.  Barely visible on its etched face is a raised symbol for the deity whose domains include madness, water, and <i>Elves</i>, Calestros.  He holds the little copper pin out to Bryti in a webbed hand.  “Mebee if’n you chat Him up some He’ll stop pesterin’ my dreams, Him.”</p>
    <p>Curiously, Bryti takes the pin. She rubs her finger over the worn symbol of the cracked mirror. She looks at the tarnished green copper for a few seconds before making a decision. She attaches the pin to the cord of her own holy symbol, on the side that has two beads.</p>
    <p>“Thank you, Allophryne,” she looks up at him, “I believe I will do that.”</p>
    <p>Allophryne grins.  It’s always important to deal fairly with other elves.  Litoria just shrugs.  From elsewhere in the camp, they hear a voice raised in song.  Smilisca is adding names to his list.</p>
    <p>Far from the comforts of their civilian flotilla, no instruments join him to make merriment of his evening rituals.  The few voices that join his hold no joy.  Now that the fires for the most dangerous departed have died down to embers, the medics begin to prepare their own for their funerals.  Sauver flops loudly to the ground beside Litoria.</p>
    <p>Allophryne’s grin disappears as he listens to the Navigator’s grief made audible.</p>
    <p>“Tomorrow mornin’.”  Litoria sighs, knowing her duty.  The blubbery hippopotamus snorts and lays her head down next to the morose elf, earning herself some ear scratches.</p>
    <p>Bryti listens to the song for a few moments. She doesn’t understand the words, though she recognizes the song. Now, in this context, she begins to understand what it really means. She turns to Litoria.</p>
    <p>“Is there… anything I can do to help?” She asks, “Or would it be better for me to make myself scarce tomorrow? I imagine your people have seen enough werewolves.”</p>
    <p>“Non, it’s best if’n yer there.”  Litoria’s focus is somewhere in the distance, listening to the melancholy songs for those river elves who are finally at rest.  “It’d be ‘en insult to skip.”</p>
    <p>"Then I will be there," Bryti concludes.</p>
    <p>After this, she falls silent. With her shoulder still touching Litoria, she sits and listens. After a pause, she glances at Litoria. She seems to recognize the distant expression on Litoria's face. She seems to search for words briefly.</p>
    <p>There are none to be found. Instead, almost hesitantly, the werewolf reaches out to hold her webbed hand, and Litoria accepts it.  They sit in peace as the waxing moon rises over the river.</p>
    <p>Allophryne looks at the two elves, and then his eyes track upwards to the moon.  He stands and gives the one-eyed gator a half-hearted toe to the ribs.  The pair shuffle off into the warm running water and give the two women some privacy.</p>
    <p>Bryti watches him go quietly. With a contemplative look, she turns back to Litoria. She quietly watches Litoria. Not just quiet observation, but instead it is as if she is trying to look at her with fresh eyes. Litoria feels Bryti’s fingers gently trace the webbings of her hand.</p>
    <p>The motion is not uncomfortable, but Bryti slowly stops and returns to gently holding her hand. Litoria is slowly starting to be able to read the werewolf’s expression, and she can tell that Bryti has much that she would like to talk about. Instead, she says nothing. She simply keeps holding Litoria’s hand and sitting shoulder to shoulder.</p>
    <p>Litoria receives a rare genuine smile from Bryti. Whatever else may be happening, in this moment, she only wants to give comfort during a very difficult time.</p>
    <p>While the two women sit in companionable silence, Allophryne rides his alligator off into the moonrise.  The moonlight is bright enough to clearly see the river’s rolling current and he deftly guides himself through it to the far bank.  It’s a slow journey, but right now he feels the need for some privacy.</p>
    <p>Allophryne floats in a shallow pool, protected from the current by his alligator’s obese mass.  He lies facing upward, seeking the sight of the moon, Luna, amidst her court of stars.</p>
    <p>“I’m told you’re not talking to folks no more.”  He can’t think of any better way to open up to the foreign goddess than complete honesty.  “I ain’t expectin’ an answer, me.”</p>
    <p>He gives a lazy stabilizing paddle with a webbed hand.  The cool water is a comfort on his injured shoulder.  It’s more bruised than cut thanks to healing magic.  But the medic said to keep it bound and not use the arm for a week or more.  So he obeys.  Floating doesn’t use the arm.  That’s permitted.</p>
    <p>He waits, looking at the moon with patience.  “Ain’t thought much ‘bout all’a’yall other gods, bein’ honest, me.  Yall probably ain’t thought much a me neither.”  Allophryne lets his toes slide through the silty mud in the riverbank, and floats.  He lets the water cradle him, and allows himself the soft focus to see the sky as a whole with the moon at its apex.  “I don’t know you, non.  I need ta serve you, but I don’ know you.”</p>
    <p>The river elf breathes deeply of the warm night draped around him.  He smells the damp earth, the soft silt, the river flowing past him, and he watches the sky.</p>
    <p>“So tell me about yourself.”</p>
    <p>Allophryne receives only silence in response. A warm breeze rolls over the river's surface, and the moon remains as distant and unknown as ever.</p>
    <p>Still, it is not discouraging. Bryti had said it had taken her years to get an answer and she was some big fancy werewolf. He was just some simple river elf. Maybe She just needed some time to believe he really meant it.</p>
    <p>"Mais, maybe later," he mumbles, "I'll ask again tomorrow, me."</p>
    <p>Allophryne closes his eyes and relaxes. He allows himself to slip under the surface of the water. After a while, he feels dull exhaustion start to overtake him. He lets it. Bryti told him to get some rest, after all.</p>
    <p>He dreams of moonlight filtering through clear river water.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Come dawn, Litoria performs again her routine examination of the silversheen on her weapon.  Bryti may notice the ritual quality of the action.  Bryti meets her on the riverbank, watching Sauver placidly munch on the greenery.</p>
    <p>"Hello there," Bryti casually pats Sauver behind the ears.</p>
    <p>She watches Litoria examine her weapon, but says nothing. The werewolf doesn't quite give the silver weapon the same look of disgust at before, but she is clearly a little off put by it. Regardless, she waits for Litoria to finish before speaking.</p>
    <p>"What can I do?" She asks.</p>
    <p>“Today we burn our dead.”  Litoria has accepted this cost multiple times before.  “Weh, an we gon’ continue till th’ job’s done.  Smilisca’s got charge of it since he ain’t no healer.  An’ there’s still plenty of that to do.”  Litoria slaps the water to get Sauver’s attention and waits for the hippopotamus to come to her.  She pauses to scratch the massive hippo’s nose affectionately.</p>
    <p>“I’ll be lightin’ the fires.  It’d be a great respect if you’d come, weh.”</p>
    <p>"Absolutely," Bryti walks towards Litoria,"I owe these soldiers my respect and my thanks. If not for them…"</p>
    <p>She glances at Litoria, but lets that fall silent.</p>
    <p>"I am with you," she finishes.</p>
    <p>“Weh,” Litoria acknowledges, before climbing up on the hippo’s wide back.  She gives a salute, which any blade elf would read as sloppy, but is the best a river elf would bother with.  With a brief reminder to meet her in the field before noon, she rides away to her duties.</p>
    <p>The Purifier has her own duties to attend to. After a short meal, she returns to the wounded camp to provide more aid. Another round of healing, and another four afflicted saved. This time, there are a few more off duty soldiers who have come to watch.</p>
    <p>The soldiers seem to be a bit more accepting of her now, though still suspicious. As the werewolf moves around camp, she gets plenty of strange looks and muttering conversations in her wake but is otherwise not bothered. Even without Litoria's escort, her presence seems at least tolerated by the river elves.</p>
    <p>Bryti arrives in the field as soon as she is ready. She is once again wearing her black clothing and armor, now that it has been cleaned and repaired. She is starting to look much more like herself again. She looks for Litoria.</p>
    <p>She finds Litoria and Sauver hauling the last stack of freshly cut pine into place. Litoria’s duty in this event may be one of a ceremonial, leadership sort of role in a normal military.  But here with the Angry Alligators her tasks involves a lot more manual labor - you can certainly haul more lumber with a hippopotamus than without.  And she’s not the sort of officer who considers herself above such tasks.</p>
    <p>Without complaint or comment, Bryti steps in to help. While she may not know the ritual, hard work is its own language. Though she is clearly still recovering from her trial, she has strength enough to assist.</p>
    <p>With their efforts, nineteen pyres have been constructed, and this stack of wood belongs to the last of them.  Crocodilians and Archerfish alike work to build the green wood platforms for their fallen comrades, stripped of their armor, but still holding the shafts of their long, wicked spears.  The heads of the giggin’ sticks have been removed.  Their silver is far too rare and valuable to burn with their remains. </p>
    <p>On three of the stacks of wood, a kayak has already been placed with its owner’s body inside.  The paddle rests on the ground, waiting.  While Litoria works to stack the final bit of lumber, comrades of the Angry Alligators headed to Rest work to prepare the next body.  They carefully remove the dead elf’s teeth before placing them into a kayak.</p>
    <p>As the preparations move to the more personal elements, Bryti takes a step back. She watches quietly from a respectful distance. She gives the elves a strange look as the teeth are removed, but does not comment. As they move on, she silently walks over to stand next to Litoria. </p>
    <p>When the last kayak sits on its stack of fuel, Litoria sends orders for the camp to gather.  Only the sentries are expected to not be present for this task.  Even the wounded who can suffer the move are carried over to the where the fires will be lit.</p>
    <p>There’s not any obvious signal for it to begin.  But at some point, the gathered military begins to speak.  Some use Sylvan, some use Elven, and others use Common.  The only thing they have in common when speaking is the anger their expressions hold.  They berate the dead for having gone to rest early, for abandoning their duties, for leaving so much work to do, for zigging when they ought to have zagged, for catching the sword that was meant for another, for so many, many things.</p>
    <p>Litoria has her own things to say to them, and it is a cathartic act to be able to say it out loud.  This strange military tradition, shouting at the dead, slowly quiets down after a long hour.  Quieter things are said at the end of it, by those who knew the deceased the best.  Gentle goodbyes, quiet promises.  And Litoria makes a few promises of her own.  The same ones she always makes, to not let them be a waste, to keep their People safe, to carry on until Calestros brings them to Rest in Her.</p>
    <p>As the words spoken by the group quiet, Bryti closes her eyes and bows her head. She places a hand over her chest, where she keeps her holy symbol. She speaks quietly in Skaplyndi. Litoria is close enough to understand her. She is apologizing that her war required their sacrifices, and thanking them for making it anyway.</p>
    <p>And when noone is left who needs to speak, Smilisca fumbles with flint and steel to light a torch.  It’s growing late in the day by now, and insects buzz noisily while he works.  Once the torch is lit, squad members for the deceased light their paddles from the source.  And using this shared flame, they light the funeral pyres for those lost in the battle against the Afflicted horde. </p>
    <p>The fresh sap in the carefully selected pines burns hot and fast.  It catches easily and stays lit without trouble.  There is, however, a lot of smoke.  The fires are given wide berth by those who watch them.</p>
    <p>And then the ceremony is done.  All that is left is to make sure the fire doesn’t spread and put out the final coals when it burns itself out.</p>
    <p>Litoria turns to Bryti and thanks her.  “Thank you fer stayin.  Means a lot.”</p>
    <p>Bryti raises her head and looks to Litoria. "It does. Thank you for allowing me to."</p>
    <p>Smilisca approaches, his task mostly complete.</p>
    <p>“So you done axed her yet?”  His tone is accusatory.</p>
    <p>"Er," Bryti looks between the two of them, "Asked me what?"</p>
    <p>“Been busy busy.”  Litoria makes a face at her cousin.  “Mais.  Weh, I mean to ax you, whatchu know about somewhat callin themselves ‘Wolf Elves’?”</p>
    <p>A blank look comes over Bryti's face. "A <i>what</i> elf? <i>Wolf</i> elf? I am sorry, I have never heard of that before."</p>
    <p>“Me neither.”  Smilisica shrugs.  “Mais, though’ we’d ask.  Yer the only Lycan around to talk to, weh.”</p>
    <p>“Shyrendora up in Hilt’Inn says dey caught one a’peepin on em, an’ says dey done use poisons n magic.  An t’were spies in Ft. Alfyr usin’ same.  Callin’ emselves Wolf Elves make us think either a Lycan connection or somethin’ with the missin’ Totem Elves gone wrong.”  Litoria explains their thought process a little more thoroughly.  “An really, only one Lycan we ken talk to.”</p>
    <p>The Lycan shrugs, "That is fair enough. They were using poisons? Is… everyone alright?"</p>
    <p>“Non,” Smilisca says gently, “we don’ know.  Ain’t been given a whole bunch a details.”</p>
    <p>Bryti frowns, "Well, they were caught so that is something. If I knew anything about these wolf elves I would tell you - <i>will</i> tell you if I find out. I only have conjecture. There may well be a connection with Lycans. Who knows what may have shaken loose in the chaos following the war?"</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria nods agreement.</p>
    <p>"I suppose that was a disappointing answer," Bryti nods to Smilisca, "I shall strive to be more mysterious and wise in the future."</p>
    <p>“Mais la that’s good.”  Smilisca cracks a smile at the werewolf.  “I know who to axe fer help wi mysterious wolf things in the future, me.”  He winks conspiratorially.</p>
    <p>“A’no.  More serious though.”  The wizard turns toward his cousin.  “The Coyote’s still holdin’ them flap flap Shadimon as hostage, an no word still from anywhat else.  Nought we ken do on our own, non?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Litoria agrees, “we just gotta keep ‘im in our prayers.”</p>
    <p>Bryti turns to Smilisca in surprise, “Wait, <i>Shadimon</i> is being held hostage? Do you know if he is unharmed?”</p>
    <p>“You know the head flap flap?  Wait, o’course you do.  Mysterious and wise.”  The wizard shrugs to himself.  “We ain’t got much else to go on - jus’ the message from Coyote that they done snatched him.  Wish I knew how, me.”</p>
    <p>Bryti snorts a laugh, “Actually, we’ve met. He seems a good man. Coyotes, you say? Don’t know much about them, other than I’ve seen the odd elf on a horse around. Hm.”</p>
    <p>She scratches her chin, “Well, I’d offer to turn into a twenty foot tall monster and tear a few buildings down to help, but I suppose that would cause more problems than it solves. Though… I will keep him in mine, as well. He’s the kind of man that we…”</p>
    <p>She pauses and blinks, looking surprised, “... we will need on our side. Hm.”</p>
    <p>“Don’ ferget to breathe ice like some kinda white dragon,” Litoria somehow manages to keep a straight face, “it’d sore disappoint tha Hunger if’n ya didn’t live up to all his rumors.”  She doesn’t comment on the obvious.</p>
    <p>“Mmmhmm,” She scratches her chin as she regains her composure, “And what of all the novel fans? I hear there’s quite a following in Surt. They’d be heartbroken.”</p>
    <p>“There’s a novel?” Smilisca asks, eyebrows raised.  He takes off his hat and holds it over his heart.  “I solemnly swear I do need to read that, me.”</p>
    <p>“You’re in luck then,” she digs around in her bag and produces a copy of <i>Love Bites</i>, complete with worn cover art, “I traded some animal pelts for this off of a fire elf near Hilt’Inn.  I’m going to want it back though. I read it when I need a good laugh.”</p>
    <p>“Pfoo-wee!  <span class="tooltip">Les contes de loup-garou me donnent des frissons.<span class="tooltiptext">Werewolf tales give me the chills.</span></span>  This’un looks to be foh shore excellent.”  Smilisca plops his ugly hat back on top of his messy hair.  He accepts the book from Bryti and gives her a friendly pat on the back.  “I best get to work on it a’fore you leave us again, me.”</p>
    <p>“I…” she glances at Litoria, “Think you may have a little longer than last time.” </p>
    <p>“Tha’s good.”  The wizard smiles at her, and then looks to his cousin as well.  “Wouldn’ want you stuck out here all alone a’fer all that, non.”</p>
    <p>“Litoria seems to have a similar opinion. I was informed I am staying at least until the full moon.” Bryti comments with a smile.</p>
    <p>Smilisca grins.  “I’m glad to have ya as long as ya wanna stay, me.”  He gives Bryti a sideways hug and then steps away.  “I’ll git em herded toward supper.”  The Navigator leaves, to resume his official duties.</p>
    <p>Bryti accepts the hug with only moderate awkwardness. She watches the Navigator head off to his duties, then turns back to Litoria with a pensive look on her face.</p>
    <p>“You, Smilisca, Allophryne…” she thinks aloud, “You really do want me around, don’t you?” </p>
    <p>“Weh, is et too obvious?”  Litoria gives the werewolf something that is a distant cousin to a smile.  “We owe you a great debt of gratitude, an’ a river elf’s always got to keep a fair balance wi’ our kin.  You saved our skins.  Let m-us try’n help you.”</p>
    <p>“In that case…” Bryti folds her arms and raises an eyebrow at Litoria, “You’d better get to training me soon enough. It won’t do to have a crazed werewolf running around your ranks chopping things up like a madwoman. You’ll have to teach me how river elves fight,” she pauses, “and probably also Sylvan.”</p>
    <p>Litoria snorts.</p>
    <p>“Weh, we ken work on your Sylvan.”  She starts to walk in the same direction Smilisca left in, and motions Bryti to follow.  “An we’re gon’ need to start drillin for replacements soon.  You ken fill in the ranks if yer really willin’.”</p>
    <p>Bryti follows and shakes her head, "I still have my mission, and for me that precludes a soldier's life. I have no doubt that I will have to keep walking this path alone, but… maybe not always. I… I was guided to you. I am starting to think it may have been for a reason."</p>
    <p>Litoria ponders that a moment while they walk toward food.</p>
    <p>“Stranger things in all the world done happened than havin’ a god point someone toward where the need is most dire.  I told you ‘bout what happened wi’ the Crag elves?  If we hadn’t gone to that potluck an met em, an if that Ink weren’t able to make the teleport, Partager’d have spilled right into the territory they’re claimin’.”  She makes a small sign over her heart.  “We’d have ended up in a fight nobody wanted, weh.  Might e’en all be dead now.”</p>
    <p>“Mad god done made it possible to avoid tha’ future.  ‘En we’re sure glad of it.”</p>
    <p>Bryti stops dead in her tracks with her eyes wide. She stands there for a few seconds, as if processing what Litoria has said before speaking.</p>
    <p>“Mother’s light…” she whispers before looking to Litoria, “You said… you met them at the potluck? And if you hadn’t met them there, then... “ Her expression is completely bewildered. </p>
    <p>“Weh that’s right.  It were some luck, that.”  Litora looks at Bryti, confused by how confused she apparently is.  This is not the direction she was expecting to have this conversation go.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," Bryti regains her composure a bit, "I can't tell you everything as I made promises, but… I met a Crag before that potluck, when they did not know my nature. I… told them about the other elves. About Fort Alfyr. They did not know. I met them entirely by chance, after tracking down afflicted hiding in the mountains. If I hadn't…" she trails off.</p>
    <p>Litoria’s eyes widen with awe.</p>
    <p>“So you’re sayin... mais la...”  She hurriedly makes the quick little prayer sign again.  “You done saved us twice now.  I owe that goddess of yours a heck of a debt.”</p>
    <p>Bryti runs a hand down her braid, "I… don't understand what is happening. It brought me to you, though. So I will give my thanks." </p>
    <p>“‘S not always for us to understand,” Litoria agrees quietly as they reach their destination.  “Weh, definitely not for me ta’ know.  Mais we ken jus’ have thanks fer the gifts we’re given.”  She steps into the serving line.  Allophryne has been roped into mess duty, and is spooning a shrimp dish over bowls of rice.  They have a meal together.  </p>
    <p>It’s nice. No tension. The river elves seem to be growing accustomed to her. Instead of being hated, the werewolf feels welcome. Maybe even more than welcome.</p>
    <p>For the first time in many years, Bryti catches herself feeling like she has a home. She might even allow herself to accept that.</p>
