    <h1>A Choice Made</h1>
    <p>Unlike certain other wizards, Smilisca is polite enough to send a message and ask when and where is best for him to arrive. After so many other surprising visitors, the winged elves have to actually sit and decide where exactly they want to receive such esteemed guests.</p>
    <p>After a little deliberation, they choose the holy symbol of Luna just outside the observatory as the target. It’s both a large open area and an easy target to focus on for a teleport spell. Anasatri, Thuridan, and Naleryn form the welcoming party.</p>
    <p>Smilisca’s teleport comes in the form of a large bubble of water. It pops with a small splash leaving a wet circle around the new arrivals. Smilisca, Allophryne, and Bryti stand in a group around the big, leathery sofa that is Blinkin'. To Anasatri’s relief, the two purifiers look to be doing well. Allophryne is standing a little straighter than usual and sports a silvery chain around his neck and under his shirt, and Bryti appears to have resumed keeping her hair in a single long braid again.</p>
    <p>Smilisca steps up to their welcoming party. </p>
    <p>"Mais it's good to see yall," the wizard offers a webbed hand to Anasatri to shake.  "An thanks fer takin the offer serious.  I ain't want to lose these two, non."</p>
    <p>Anasatri takes his hand in both of hers, “Absolutely, and we’re glad to have you. Are you staying too or just dropping them off?”</p>
    <p>“Mais, I’d like t’ see that Orrery if’n you don’t mind havin’ a tourist?”</p>
    <p>She grins, “Absolutely! We do love showing it off.” She looks past him to Bryti and Allophryne and holds out her arms in a silent question.</p>
    <p>Bryti looks at Anasatri, then marches towards her. Bryti quietly puts both hands on the smaller elf's shoulders, then without warning picks her up bodily and hugs her.</p>
    <p>"You saved my life," Bryti says, "Our lives. All three of us."</p>
    <p>“Weh, only a small exaggeration,” Allophryne adds, before also joining the hug, “Blinkin’ would prolly have been fine, weh.”</p>
    <p>Anasatri hugs them both tight, “I’m just so glad it was in time. All we could do was warn you and then wait and hope…! But you’re all right? Both of you?” </p>
    <p>Bryti sets down Anasatri and glances back at Allophryne. She briefly unconsciously touches her braid before turning back to Anasatri.</p>
    <p>"Yes," she nods, "It… was not a pleasant experience. Not one I intend to repeat. The river elves were more than happy to let me recover, however. Allophryne has hardly let me out of his sight." </p>
    <p>Anasatri lets out a long breath, “Good, I’m so glad...Well! Welcome back, you remember Naleryn and Thuridan. Smilisca, these are two of the leads for the research team based here.” She gestures at the other two elves, “This is Smilisca, the Navigator for the river elf flotillas.”</p>
    <p>Thuridan dips his wings politely and grins, “I think I can safely say we can make your visit here <i>very</i> worthwhile beyond just keeping these two safe.” He glances at Bryti, “Everyone knows that you were in some kind of danger, but only the three of us here know the full details. People will be glad to know you’re all right. Also...we know you can disguise yourself? The outpost has grown into a village since you were last here, so outside of the Observatory, that might not be a bad idea.”</p>
    <p>“Can’t be too careful,” Bryti agrees, “They already know about the Katya identity. I will be cycling through disguises while here. I do not intend to spend much time outside the observatory, at any rate. I have <i>several</i> questions for Anasatri.” </p>
    <p>She chuckles, “And I have several answers for you, I hope. Let’s go on in.”</p>
    <p>The Observatory is familiar to Bryti and Allophryne from their last visit, but the combination of Lycan architecture and winged elf furniture and colorful decorations is an exciting new experience for Smilisca. Anasatri keeps up a cheerful chatter, pointing out where things are. As before, when they reach the short staircase leading up to the Orrery chamber, she pauses and smiles at Bryti with more than a touch of mischief, “After you.”</p>
    <p>Bryti answers that with a formal bow and a light smirk. She steps forward and walks up the stairs to the orrery itself with a purpose. As the group ascends to the orrery chamber, they keep a reverential quiet.</p>
    <p>Someone, it seems, has a sense of drama. The observation windows are closed and the crystal is lit, bathing the room in an otherworldly glow. The shining brass orrery dominates the center of the room.  Even when not in motion, it seems to speak of mystery and power. The spheres align, and to the trained eye center on the small mithral sphere that represents Luna.</p>
    <p>Bryti steps towards the outermost ring and places a hand gently on the intricate brass teeth of the gears. She looks over the entire mechanism then steps back with a small gasp. She stares at it for a few seconds before speaking.</p>
    <p>“You did it,” she speaks with barely a whisper, “You actually did it. It is whole.”</p>
    <p>Allophryne feels something. He is drawn to the orrery, called but not commanded. It is a wordless feeling. Allophryne feels as if he is lying at the bottom of a river, with a warm and welcoming current moving towards the device. It is a powerful but gentle feeling.  He stays quiet, and fades to the back of the group.</p>
    <p>Anasatri smiles at Bryti a little, “I feel it too.”</p>
    <p>Thuridan folds his arms and looks up at the machine with pride, “We did, better than ever. We’ve got quite a team here.” He flicks his ears toward Smilisca, “I don’t suppose star charts would be of use to you in your work?” </p>
    <p>“Mais...” Smilisca looks over the device with awe.  “Weh.  <i>Weh.</i>  They are accurate, weh?  An’ nothin’ like ‘em human maps?”  He is absolutely astonished by the intricate detail on display.</p>
    <p>Naleryn goes and rummages in a cabinet for a moment, coming up with a few charts. They may have left a few in the room specifically to show people. “Entirely accurate. We’ve done the math backwards, forwards, and sideways to check it. We haven’t made <i>new</i> maps yet, but all the old ones we’ve tested come out perfectly.” She offers him the stack of charts to look over. </p>
    <p>“Can yall show me?”  The amazed wizard looks over the charts.  “I real <i>real bad</i> want t’see how it all works, me.”</p>
    <p>“I promise not to critique,” Bryti comments, “Much.”</p>
    <p>Naleryn and Thuridan laugh, “If <i>you</i> find something to critique, tell us. If you have nothing to say then we’ll call it a total success!”</p>
    <p>Anasatri plucks one of the maps from the stack Smilisca is holding and goes over to the orrery. After a moment, it starts to move. Very slowly the rings begin to turn, the planar models rotating as it moves. The star patterns shining on the dome flicker and smear as Anasatri adjusts the mechanism on the crystal itself, and finally blooms into a new, intricate pattern. She looks up, muttering to herself as she checks the locations of a few key stars against the map, and then nods with a grin. “And here we are! This is the sky right above us.”</p>
    <p>Bryti digs in her bag and removes her small portable orrery. It only calculates the position of the moon and the world. She looks from that to the massive mechanism on display. She chuckles quietly to herself and nods. </p>
    <p>Thuridan and Naleryn exchange pleased grins, “Everything check out?”</p>
    <p>“Definitely,” Bryti speaks without taking her eyes off the orrery. </p>
    <p>“Navigator, we can show you the archive whenever you like,” Naleryn says. “We’ve got all the actual calculation records down there, and the construction notes.”</p>
    <p>“Weh, non,” Smilisca mutters quietly to himself, observing the movement of the planes in orbit.  “I’d for shore love to see the technical details, me.”</p>
    <p>“Absolutely. The archive is down in the basement. Oh, let me show you where the cistern is on the way in case you need to cool off…” Their voices fade as they head back down the stairs, leaving Bryti, Allophryne, and Anasatri alone with the orrery.</p>
    <p>“I love coming up here,” Anasatri says quietly. “It feels <i>nice.</i>”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods solemnly.</p>
    <p>“I thought you might,” she says, “It’s more than just fixed. It’s whole again. It’s working. I can feel the connection.” </p>
    <p>“What does it feel like to you? I feel a warm wind, Ink heard singing…”</p>
    <p>“Howling,” Bryti turns to Anasatri with a raised eyebrow, “Obviously. <i>Ink</i> felt it?” </p>
    <p>“Heh, of course. And he did. He helped us figure out how to <i>use</i> it, magically.” She glances at the door briefly, “We used it to contact the ancestors.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, that was one of the <i>several</i> things I had questions about,” Bryti manages to fully divert her attention to Anasatri, “You somehow got a message from Father Wolf?” </p>
    <p>“It was…” Anasatri looks up at the orrery, watching it dance, “We made a bridge to where they are, and...I was <i>there</i>. Not just talking to them, but <i>with</i> them. Sister Owl and Father Wolf were the ones I talked to, but all the others were there, watching.” She flicks her ears down, “I wanted to find out how to help Luna.”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know it could <i>do</i> that…” Bryti glances back at the orrery, “You… were there? Speaking with them? In the same plane? Did… did they seem alright?” </p>
    <p>Anasatri’s wings slump, “No...no, they’re hurting too. I was asking about the wolf elves, because I <i>know</i> they’re a problem for Her. I have a transcription of that information to give you, but I asked Father Wolf if there was anything he thought was most important for us to know right then, and he gave me the warning to pass to you.” She smiles a little, “Ink had to send it for me; I couldn’t talk for a week after the ritual.”</p>
    <p>“That explains it then,” Bryti sighs, “At least they can still speak… I know we have no choice, but can Ink be trusted?” </p>
    <p>“Yes, no question.”</p>
    <p>“Very well,” Bryti tilts her head at the sudden conviction, “I will take your word for that. I don’t know what method he used to access the orrery in such a way, but it sounds like it was very taxing. I won’t ask you to do that again, but I do have something else. I know my method for using it, and I can show you. I was planning on teaching Allophryne how anyway. It’s part of the duties of a purifier.”</p>
    <p>“Speaking of,” she turns to Allophryne, “Can you feel it?” </p>
    <p>“Weh,” the quiet river elf responds. Bryti simply nods in reply.</p>
    <p>“I’d love to learn your method,” Anasatri says. “My usual method is to just...meditate in here and see if I have a vision.”</p>
    <p>“Then I will show you both,” Bryti says, “But later. My method can only be used at night. Er… maybe don’t expect to commune directly with the ancestor constellations or anything. It’s perhaps a touch less dramatic than that. Hopefully you find it useful.” </p>
    <p>“I am <i>very</i> alright with less dramatic,” Anasatri says with feeling, “That was amazing, but <i>exhausting</i>.”</p>
    <p>“Then we agree,” Bryti notes, “Let’s get settled in. If you can arrange some time with the orrery alone, we can get started tonight. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a full orrery. I thought I would never see one again… much less teach someone to use it.” </p>
    <p>“That at least is easy! Everyone knows I come up here in the evenings. I’ll make sure no one else had plans, and we can have the whole night.” She starts heading back to the door, “Those same rooms you used last time are open if you’d like to drop your things off.” </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Come nightfall, Bryti leads the other two elves up to the orrery. There is deliberate reverence to her motion, but not quite ceremony. She brings her own crumpled and worn star charts as well as her orrery. She also brings a handful of star charts that she brought from the archive.</p>
    <p>Still clad in her normal clothing, she sits herself in front of the orrery itself with her smaller example and the star charts arrayed in front of her. It is something that Allophryne has seen her do before, almost every night, but she had not explained it before now.</p>
    <p>“I have said that I came to this region by accident,” Bryti explains, “That… is not exactly accurate. Luna may not be able to speak, but she is able to guide. With charts and an orrery, one may commune with her, at least indirectly.”</p>
    <p>“As to what I do… it is relatively simple. I meditate, and I calculate. With charts and my small orrery, I can calculate a path. A map, maybe. By contemplating the stars, I can determine a path. Inspiration, I guess you could call it. Usually, it can lead me into a region where my services are needed, an outbreak of affliction… but lately, it has been guiding me to stranger places.”</p>
    <p>“This meditation did guide me to the afflicted horde we encountered, yes, but… among other places, it led me to Surt. It led me to Partager, and by extension the river elves. It led me to Asavardi, to Alfyr… all of which makes it clear. Luna <i>wants</i> me to be here, she wants me to be among these elves.”</p>
    <p>Bryti sighs.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know why. I’m hoping that contemplating a true orrery might explain more about why I’m here, why I was guided to be among the elves. Hopefully it can do the same for you as well.”</p>
    <p>“Not too different from what I usually do,” Anasatri says, collecting a small stack of paper and a charcoal stick from one of the side tables. She sits next to Bryti, “She brought the two of you together, and then led me to you, too. Maybe the three of us being here together will turn up something new.” She motions for Allophryne to join them, “There are plenty more writing supplies if either of you need more.” </p>
    <p>“I think this will be more than suitable,” Bryti comments as she observes the mass of assembled writing materials and charts, “I’ve been going by the same frayed half dozen charts for over ten years now. This is the absolute lap of luxury by comparison.”</p>
    <p>Bryti carefully assembles a series of charts that depict the stars around the Watchtower at this time of year. Thanks to previous efforts, this particular point in time and location is extremely well documented. Her “ritual” at first appears quite pragmatic. She begins by speaking with Allophryne and guiding him through her process of using star charts to plot a course.</p>
    <p>She starts from their current location and time. She then begins to use the orrery and the charts to calculate a direction of travel. This process is quick, taking only a few minutes. It is a simple, relaxing activity. Using the charts, she guides the other two elves through the process of mediating on a course of action, on a direction, and on what stars may guide them.</p>
    <p>The trio quickly fall into a harmonious pattern. Though it’s not something he has done before, the task feels familiar to Allophryne. He’s planned river routes many, many times in his life. Each route feels like a new course charted. As they plot courses, Allophryne feels that they are not quite the correct ones. Each new course plotted, however, feels slightly closer.</p>
    <p>No one is even really sure where normalcy ends and the vision begins. Pathways extend, die out, continue, interweave and connect. The movements of the spheres in the orrery continue, become smooth. The stars expand from the ceiling and become a medium through which they move. Charcoal and parchment become what they represent, a totem of causality.</p>
    <p>Luna circles the World, the World circles Luna. They move in patterns grand and graceful, intricate and precise. Luna reflects in the ocean, Her light scatters and disperses, glowing in a silent sea. The sea follows the moon, drawn to Her grace and power. Luna passes and the sea recedes, missing her presence.</p>
    <p>The tides follow the moon, water seeks the sky, a pattern as old as time, a dance as beautiful as the spheres and stars. They are locked together, but can never touch. Their light, their grace, are in a dance that lasts an eternity, growing closer and further, but linked by forces too powerful to fully comprehend.</p>
    <p>Luna’s light reflects on the surface of the water. Her face is touched by the ripples and eddies on the water’s surface, turned and moved until she appears as a glowing disc covered in cracks. Through the surface, the moon and Her shattered mirror align and overlap, and one cannot be separated from the other. Ethereal and beautiful the sisters dance, a motion that continues for eternity.</p>
    <p>Bryti stands. She is an elf. She is a wolf. She stands before the sisters who dance. Her sword is held in one hand, around the other her twin holy symbols are wrapped. They rest in her palm. She holds her silver blade before her face, hilt up.</p>
    <p>She takes the hand that holds her symbols and places it on the edge of the silver blade. Slowly, she draws her hand down the edge. Silver cuts her skin. Red blood is drawn along the blade. She takes her hand away from the blade and clasps the twin holy symbols tightly.</p>
    <p>Dripping blood, she holds her hand out to the sisters who dance. Her voice is clear and powerful, almost not her own.</p>
    <p id="i">Sister Silent, I pledge my oath.</p>
    <p id="i">I shall seek thy light and guard thy gift.</p>
    <p id="i">Sister Shattered, this my troth,</p>
    <p id="i">The curse, its vile touch, I will hunt swift.</p>
    <p id="i">Sisters of the sky and sea, by your light entranced,</p>
    <p id="i">Your reflection I will guard, each side its own court.</p>
    <p id="i">Your children I shall protect, they shall see your dance.</p>
    <p id="i">Affliction shall not claim them, its hate I will thwart.</p>
    <p>The dance swells, the two sisters sing in sound unheard. They move with the sky, the stars, and the spheres, a dance from every drop in the sea to Luna herself. All is in motion, all is one. There is harmony. There is light. There is promise.</p>
    <p>Slowly, steadily, reality returns. Bryti, Allophryne, and Anasatri are standing in the orrery chamber. The ground is littered with pages and pages of star charts. Bryti is standing before the orrery. Her blooded sword is in one hand, her other clenched tight around her holy symbols as blood slowly drips onto the floor. Somewhere in this process, she shifted to hybrid form.</p>
    <p>She slowly lowers her bloody hand. She opens it and looks at her holy symbol. Her eyes go wide.</p>
    <p>“I…” she stammers a little, “I-I have no idea what just happened.” </p>
    <p>Allophryne shrugs.  He’s not going to say it to anyone’s face, but right now he’s kind of under the impression that the gods just make stuff up as they go.</p>
    <p>Anasatri blinks a few times and shakes herself, going to one of the cabinets and bringing a rag to Bryti, “Less dramatic, you said. I can heal that, if you like.”   Allophryne makes a gesture to indicate that he agrees vehemently with this assessment.</p>
    <p>“That-That hasn’t happened before! I swear!” Bryti takes the rag and begins to clean the blood from her hand and the holy symbol. Suddenly she stops dead and her eyes go wide. She releases her hold slightly on the holy symbol and lets it dangle.</p>
    <p>Where there were once two holy symbols, now there is one. A holy symbol of Luna on one side, Calestros on the other. The cracks in Calestros’ mirror are made from copper worn green with time, as is the edge of Luna’s circle. Bryti just kind of stares at it. </p>
    <p>Allophryne holds up his shiny new holy symbol.  It’s a mithral circle, with Calestros’s cracked mirror on one side and Luna’s face on the other.</p>
    <p>“Still think it’s a coincidence, weh?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Bryti states flatly. </p>
    <p>“Weh.  Circles sure are easy to draw.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t worry, Anasatri,” Bryti takes several slow breaths, “Allophryne already had that one. I had it made for him as an Elfmas present. I… thought it was just a coincidence that the two symbols lined up so well, but I appear to have been corrected on that matter.” </p>
    <p>“Oh good,” Anasatri says, with a bit of forced levity, “I was wondering if I was supposed to start checking my pockets or something. But...no, it makes sense. Calestros <i>is</i> worried about Luna. And...in some of the visions I’ve seen, the cracks on Luna match up to the cracks on the mirror. I just didn’t...I thought...Calestros didn’t want to see another Shatter. I didn’t realize there was that <i>kind</i> of connection! You saw...they’re sisters?”</p>
    <p>“They’re deities…” Bryti passes her new holy symbol to her clean hand and passes a healing rune over the small cut. She continues to wipe the blood out of her fur and off of the sword as she talks, “Things do not work quite the same for them as they do for us. Perhaps it is not literal, as it would be in a mortal family. Perhaps the relationship between water and the moon is great enough that it affects them both. Perhaps… perhaps our own belief has affected this as well. Luna and Calestros… we are at the connection point between both of them. They both need us, it seems. Perhaps they were connected all along, perhaps not. It may not be for us to know.”</p>
    <p>She looks closely at her new holy symbol, “I am, however, getting a better idea of what we need to do.” </p>
    <p>“Father Wolf told me that part of it is...helping you. Helping Luna’s people to have hope. Treating you like people, and not monsters. It’s…” Anasatri thinks for a moment, “<i>She</i> needs to have that hope too.”</p>
    <p>Bryti flexes her hand briefly, examining the healed cut.</p>
    <p>“And Calestros’ children must be free of the haunt of the affliction. I think I’m beginning to understand why I was guided here… I feel different. I feel like I have a purpose again. I don’t think I’ve felt quite like this since I first took my vow as a purifier.” </p>
    <p>“Maybe because you just made another, equally intense vow?” Anasatri says, with more of her usual humor and a smile. </p>
    <p>“It was a vow, weh.”  Allophryne looks contemplatively at the two.  “An’ nothin’ in it says it’s got to be a Lycan, or even a Purifier, swearin’ to it.”</p>
    <p>“That is a good point,” Bryti nods, “Your reflection I will guard, each side its own court… doesn’t really declare which side of the court the speaker is on, does it?” </p>
    <p>“Non.”  Allophryne shrugs.</p>
    <p>“And you’re on both sides,” Anasatri says. “Both of you. You’re both elves, Bryti is a Lycan, and Allophryne has his vows to Luna. It’s perfect.”</p>
    <p>“Anasatri…” Bryti slowly turns to her, “You literally spoke directly with the ancestor constellations.”</p>
    <p>“We ain’t dead right now because you’re here, weh,” Allophryne agrees strongly.</p>
    <p>“<i>I’ve</i> never heard the ancestors directly,” Bryti adds, “I’ve only ever had a handful of visions. You <i>met them</i>, and saved me, <i>us</i>, in the process.” </p>
    <p>“An I only ever hear from Calestros Himself, me.”  The river elf is probably not helping as much as he wishes he were.</p>
    <p>“You were given a Lycan epithet by an observatory keeper, <i>somehow</i>, even though there are none left,” Bryti glances at Allophryne, “She’s the Skyseer, by the way. Still wondering how that happened.” </p>
    <p>Anasatri squirms, ducking her head, “It was another vision...I saw her, the last oracle, in the past. She was having a vision of me, in the future, and we talked. The ancestors knew about it too. The oracle was a wereowl, and Sister Owl was the first to answer me before Father Wolf had to help.” Her wings slump, “He was really worried about you, and upset that he couldn’t help me as much as he wanted.” She looks up at Bryti, “How do Lycans depict the ancestors? They looked like...like clouds filled with stars, but <i>felt</i> like living creatures.”</p>
    <p>“Felt…” Bryti blinks, “<i>Felt?</i>” </p>
    <p>Now Anasatri looks a bit sheepish, “Father Wolf was upset! So I might have...patted...his nose…” </p>
    <p>“Father Wolf,” Bryti balks, “The patron of all hunters. He who is swifter than darkness. You pet him.”</p>
    <p>Allophryne rolls his eyes.</p>
    <p>“I think you otter consider yourself part of this, me,” he says, folding his arms and looking all his several years older than the two ladies.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to,” she says quietly. “If-...<i>Since</i> I’m welcome. I would like that.”</p>
    <p>“I can get a symbol made for you as well,” Bryti nods, “It seems Father Wolf has voted for you. As far as what comes next… I don’t know. We should keep this among ourselves, for now, until we better understand what this means.” </p>
    <p>“That’s not a bad idea. The people who live here have gotten used to Luna’s symbols being around - even if some aren’t necessarily <i>happy</i> about it - but this would be, um, a bit too much.”</p>
    <p>“The words cult, heretic, insanity, and monster worshippers would doubtlessly be thrown around,” Bryti notes, “I am used to operating in secrecy. There may be others who would support us… but if word of this gets out, our mission here would be in danger.” </p>
    <p>Anasatri makes a face and laughs, “Oh ew, I guess we kind of are a weird cult, aren’t we.” She looks up at the orrery, still moving through its elegant dance, “It’s so strange. You hear stories about people, heroes, receiving visions and divine missions of world-changing importance. But that’s… exactly what’s happened to us, isn’t it.”</p>
    <p>“Tell me about it,” Bryti sighs, “I thought I had my life fairly well figured out, but then no, more elves. Deities sure are an insistent bunch, aren’t they?” </p>
    <p>Allophryne grumbles something about interrupting asshats, but it’s not very clear.</p>
    <p class="center">-FIN-</p>
    <h2>Deific Obedience:</h2>
    <p>There is now an Obedience for followers of the Cult of the Dancing Sisters.</p>
    <p>This cult is devoted to Luna and Calestros, and protecting their people from the vile curse of the affliction.</p>
    <p>The Obedience is to recite the Oath, cut yourself with a silver blade, and hold your holy symbol in your bloodied hand before an open sky or an orrery.</p>
    <p>Followers of the cult who have the feat and perform the obedience receive a +4 bonus to their caster level for removing curses, count as clerics for the purposes of removing lycanthropy, and can neither contract nor transmit the affliction.</p>
    <p>Though the cult is currently a secret, there may be other elves who are called to serve the Dancing Sisters...</p>
