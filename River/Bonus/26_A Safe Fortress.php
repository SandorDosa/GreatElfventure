    <h1>A Safe Fortress</h1>
    <p>A light dusting of snow coats Fort Alfyr as the holiday of Elfmas approaches. This is a new holiday, having only been celebrated since the end of the war. As such, traditions are still being sorted out. With Fort Alfyr finally being stable enough to have a stable economy, those traditions are finally starting to include decorations. Wreaths made with fir, candles in windows, and blue and white ribbons are a few of the more common sights in the narrow streets around the fort. </p>
    <p>Smilisca has been busy. Extremely busy, actually. He has been planning some kind of party ahead of the holiday, and is apparently going above and beyond to make things come together for it. Whatever it is he’s planning, it’s a major challenge even for the vast intelligence and logistical skills of the Navigator. This, of course, means he has shooed away both his apprentice and the gaggle of teenagers that are apparently latched onto him.</p>
    <p>The group finds themselves in one of the main open streets coming out of the fort. There, street vendors have set up long rows of stalls Surtian style, apparently a habit brought back by Bravo Division after their year in Surt. It seems that the apple harvest was good this year, as hot cider is a fast selling comfort drink, not to mention the pies. That’s not the most interesting thing, however.</p>
    <p>The most interesting thing is that Cel and Acris have been standing in front of a stall for fifteen minutes trying to explain to Nobody what, exactly, the purpose of a candied apple is. </p>
    <p>“You eat it,” Cel says. “And the caramel melts in your mouth and gets all gooey as the apple cooks or whatever. And its sugary and sweet and makes you feel like you could run a mile. Great stuff! That’s really all there is, though.” </p>
    <p>“I believe I understand the components,” Nobody hazards, “but… the delivery seems… complicated.  You cannot eat it as a fruit, as you cannot grasp it without sticking to it… you cannot simply eat it as the confection… and so instead, you jam a dowel into it as a compromise?  Does that not just make consuming it… even clumsier?”</p>
    <p>"Non non! Plein de foods are best when eaten off sticks!" Acris answers, trying to be helpful. "Like chicken-on-a-stick or gator-on-a-stick or um... rock candy!"</p>
    <p>Nobody’s eyes go wide, staring at Acris in disbelief.  “...Lowl- Otherelves know how to make Rock Candy?”</p>
    <p>"Weh yeah!"  Acris looks very excited about this topic.  He does love candy.  "I bet we ken find some if we ask real nice."</p>
    <p>Cel made a face. “Eugh. That just tastes like burnt syrup.”</p>
    <p>"Hey," the blade elf running the stall leans forward to the surprisingly large gaggle of teenagers blocking his stall, "I hear they were making some river elf style candy down at the south commissary. Two streets over. Can't miss it. Maybe they have some of whatever it is you're talking about. " </p>
    <p>Nobody says nothing, but her eyes, focused on Acris, bear an unmistakable question.</p>
    <p>“The answer to yer question is ‘Acris likes the taste of burnt syrup,’” Cel says. “Don’t ask me why; I think it’s gross.” </p>
    <p>"It only tastes all burnt to you, Cel," Acris responds, somewhat deflated.  "Hey Nobody, we ken go git some an see if'n it's the same thing as your rock candy. It'll be fun, weh!"</p>
    <p>Cel nods. “What can I say? I cook my own food.” She gestures southward. “Commissaries got all kinds of foods lying about -- they’re like big cafeterias that someone shoved some street stands into. I bet they’ll have your rock candy, too, if we ask. Probably using it to prop open the door or something.” </p>
    <p>Nobody ignores Cel’s jab, instead opting to nod -with way, way too much enthusiasm, looks like she still hasn’t mastered the gesture- at Acris’ suggestion.</p>
    <p>True to the beleaguered vendor’s word, the commissary isn’t hard to find. It’s visible as soon as the group reaches the street. It’s crowded enough that the front doors are open and elves are eating at streetside tables despite the cold. Warm light from braziers fills the street.</p>
    <p>Inside it’s crowded. Not surprisingly, it’s mostly blade elves. Off duty soldiers seem to be the majority of the group, receiving meals with their ration cards, but there are plenty of locals as well. There are also a surprising number of river elves in the establishment, including many river elf soldiers in dark gray uniforms that are also paying with ration cards. Oddly, a number of them are sporting bandages or bite marks.</p>
    <p>The group of fire, river, and crag gets a fair number of odd looks as they navigate the crowd. Very few have even seen a crag elf before. Here, however, no one seems to bother them. This seems to be a place where elves of all ranks interact. They are able to work their way through the open room full of tables and buffet style food carts with only a little bit of effort.</p>
    <p>Sure enough, they eventually find the rock candy. It is currently being prepared by a river elf that appears to work at the commissary as a chef, which might explain how popular this place is. In front of his stall, there is an array of crystalized sugary candy on sticks. He has managed to dye them in bright colors, mostly blues, greens, and yellows, but there are orange, reds, and purples here and there. The chef spots them and waves the group of teenagers towards his stall. </p>
    <p>“Hey there, chef!” Cel says, putting on a reasonably excited smile. “How much for two sticks?”</p>
    <p>"One copper for two," The river elf smiles back "Share one with a friend, weh?" </p>
    <p>“Bet I can one-up that,” she replies, handing the river elf a copper. “Pick your favorite,” she says to Acris and Nobody. “I’ll live vicariously.” </p>
    <p>Uncertainly, Nobody reaches forward to grab one of the sticks of colored sugar.  Settling on a vibrant turquoise, she lifts it up to her eyes, inspecting it closely.</p>
    <p>“This,” she says softly, “is not like any rock candy I have ever seen.” There is a hint of awe in her voice.</p>
    <p>"Mais, give it a try! You never know, weh?" The cheerful river elf chef laughs.</p>
    <p>Acris selects his favorite, a very red option, and breaks off a chunk to offer to Cel.</p>
    <p>"Aw, non," the chef reaches down and picks out a blue one, then offers it somewhere between Acris and Cel, "Friends that good, y'all deserve a lil' lagniappe." </p>
    <p>Cel gives them both an expression mixed between honored and horrified. She shakes her head. “Thank you -- I mean it -- but if try to eat it it’s going to scorch on my teeth and I’m going to be tasting coal for a month. Some things just can’t be eaten when you’re made of fire.” </p>
    <p>Nobody looks concerned for a moment.  “...Is it even safe to eat this much crystalline sugar at once?  Rock candies I knew of were… much smaller,” she says, indicating with her fingers something about the size of a small nut, “given to Samra and Aggro expected to undergo strenuous activity.  This much…” she trails off, giving the stick a greedy stare, but cautious expression.</p>
    <p>Acris accepts the extra and hands the red piece to Nobody instead.</p>
    <p>“Look, Nobody! You ken try three flavors!”  </p>
    <p>Nobody blinks.  “...There are different flavors of sugar?”  In spite of her earlier reluctance, however, she takes the proffered piece.  Eyeing between it and the one on the stick, she give Acris one last glance before a look of determination crosses her face.  Then, she pops the entire red chunk in her mouth, chewing on it.  </p>
    <p>There’s a soft crack, audible even from inside her mouth, and then she makes this face.</p>
    <p>"Uh," the chef clears his throat, "You ain't supposed to just-" </p>
    <p>Nobody seems to understand that she’s made some kind of error.  She looks like she’s about to spit out the confection… when a look of realization crosses her face.  She looks at Acris. Of course.  This must be just like the Jambal Aya. Lowlander pain food.</p>
    <p>She is a Crag.  She will endure.  And so, she continues gronshing loudly.</p>
    <p>“Think you’re supposed to suck on it or something,” Cel says. “Don’t worry, I always end up crunching it too.” </p>
    <p>Acris stares in surprise.</p>
    <p>“What kinda rock candy do yall have up north?” he asks, followed by a much quieter, “<small>Are your teeth okay, weh?</small>”</p>
    <p>Nobody seems to finally get the idea, and stops pulverizing the sugar with her molars.  Unsure of how to suck on the sugar grit in her mouth, however, she just kind of settles on swishing it around in there.  Thus occupied, she looks curiously at Cel.</p>
    <p>Cel shrugged. “I dunno. Don’t think we’ve got a lot of rock candy. Syrup and pastries, yeah, certainly.”</p>
    <p>There is a slight shifting from the nearby crowd. People part, letting someone through. A robed figure steps up to the stand and puts down a coin, picking a yellow and a green.</p>
    <p>"Bienvenue, Parrain!" The chef gives a little bit of a bow, "Always a pleasure, weh?"</p>
    <p>"Hello Nicefori," Grandmaster Ehra greets the chef cheerfully, "Of course! Glad to see you're spicing things up."</p>
    <p>Ehra turns to hand one of the two candies to Siiri, who is currently muttering something about teeth under her breath. Ehra blinks as he notices the trio of teenagers.</p>
    <p>"Well, hello Acris, Cel!" He smiles at them, "I see you've made a new friend." </p>
    <p>Cel gives Ehra a hasty salute and a nervous smile. "Grandmaster, meet Nobody," she says, gesturing to the Crag. "Which is her name." </p>
    <p>"Nobody, hm?" Ehra returns the salute quickly but politely then turns to the Crag, "I've heard stranger names, but not many.  I'm Grandmaster Ehra Indrek. It's good to meet you, Nobody. Are you enjoying your time among other elves?" </p>
    <p>Working quickly, Nobody makes a few more perfunctory crunches before finally swallowing the sugar grit.  When she speaks, it is soft but firm. “ My time in these lands has been both joyous and illuminating.  It is also painful and confusing.  Yet each day, it is the act of Acris and Cel which seeks to expose the confusing and make the painful rote by exposure.”</p>
    <p>There is a muffled <i>honk</i> from the satchel at her side.</p>
    <p>“...Grandmaster Indrek, I thank you for your greeting, and for your concern,” she rattles off by rote.</p>
    <p>Ehra pauses only briefly to parse that description.</p>
    <p>"Of course," Ehra nods to her, "A little help from friends makes everything easier. I am glad that you have found some. Speaking of…"</p>
    <p>Ehra turns to Cel.</p>
    <p>"I believe we have something to talk about." </p>
    <p>Cel nods, and then unties her scabbard from her belt before offering it to Ehra hilt-first. She closes her eyes. She feels the sword and scabbard gently taken from her hands. There is only a very brief pause before it is placed back in her hands.</p>
    <p>“You can open your eyes,” Ehra says, “You did just fine.” </p>
    <p>Cel opens her eyes, and breathes out. “Phew,” she says. “Getting swords repaired is hard.” She gives Ehra a careful look. “So what happens now? Do I, umm… just going back to training right now? I’m kinda enjoying this whole ‘adventure-training’ style of thing. We saved a hippo.”</p>
    <p>“I heard,” Ehra gives a sly smile, “Smilisca told me all about it, and how you got Terje to fix your sword. In honesty… the sword doesn’t matter. It’s an excellent blade now, but there are many excellent blades in the world - especially here. What I wanted to see is that you would get it fixed. Finding that kind of skill isn’t easy, much less without coin to back it up. I wanted to see if you did still have the will to continue, but honestly I had little doubt.”</p>
    <p>“I also wanted to see <i>how</i> you got it fixed, and Terje was exactly who I was hoping you would go to in the end. I expect it wasn’t hard to get him to fix it, was it?” </p>
    <p>"He told me I had to step up my game," Cel said. "Apparently hiding his dinner in the kitchen wasn't good enough or something." </p>
    <p>Ehra genuinely laughs at that.</p>
    <p>“He <i>would</i> say that,” Ehra shakes his head a little bit, “The point being, I wanted you to learn why we were being so hard on you. Terje, especially, I know was getting under your skin. We think like blade elves and train like blade elves, and well, you aren’t one. He wasn’t being hard on you because he wants you to fail, he was being hard on you because he wants you to succeed, and… I believe, in many ways, it is we who were failing you, not the other way around.”</p>
    <p>Ehra gently places a hand on the sheathed sword.</p>
    <p>“Which is why I am leaving this up to you. You will always have a place here, Cel. There is no time limit. I think you’re starting to understand us a little better, and hopefully yourself as well. You are an elf, Cel. You have a lot of time. The days of drafting the youngest elves into a lifetime of strife are over. That was done to me. That was a crime. <i>This</i> is your choice. You may return to Alfyr whenever you feel ready to train with us. Until then? Maybe a little adventure is healthy.” </p>
    <p>Cel blinks. “...Thank you, Grandmaster!” she says quickly. “...I do think I’m kind of getting what he meant better than I was. I’m not exactly disciplined, I’ll admit.”</p>
    <p>"Neither is Terje," Siiri grumbles from somewhere nearby.</p>
    <p>"It's good that you can see that," Ehra just continues right past that snide comment, "But you still fixed the sword. You still want to train with us." </p>
    <p>Cel nods, and then glances at Acris and Nobody. "I do," she says quickly. "But I think I owe Nobody a bit more of a tour before I'm ready to go back."</p>
    <p>“Then I’m going to trust that you will know when you are ready,” Ehra speaks seriously, then lightens his tone slightly, “And maybe Nobody does need some assistance before she breaks a tooth,” he gestures at the Crag who appears to be dangerously close to chewing on the stick.</p>
    <p>“D’you think you’re gon’ come to Asavardi wi’ us then, Cel?” Acris asks, hopefully.</p>
    <p>Cel smiles. “I think meeting the Flying Elves would be pretty worth it, yeah,” she says. “Saw some of their training at the Fort before. Maybe I can learn a bit of that.”</p>
    <p>Ehra chuckles at that.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps with enough enthusiasm," he tells Cel, "I'm glad you've reached a decision for now. Youth is a gift. Don't waste it. With that platitude out of the way, I believe I have some other wayward trainees to attend to. Good luck, Cel."</p>
    <p>With that, Ehra gives the group a polite half-bow and turns to walk back into the crowd with Siiri. </p>
    <p>Nobody waits until the is out of (read: likely still well within) earshot, before asking the pressing question.  “...Is one supposed to consume the stick as well?”</p>
