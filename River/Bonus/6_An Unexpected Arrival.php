    <h1>An Unexpected Arrival</h1>
    <p>The bitter cold of winter has finally left. It was a particularly nasty one, and the river elves are quite glad to see it gone. Spring is here, and it warms the waters and the heart. Partager has set off down the Goldfall. They left Fort Alfyr behind a few weeks ago. They have passed out of the more fertile lands near the Fort and are entering the dry, rocky badlands that surround the Caldera. </p>
    <p>The weather is now getting quite warm, and the sun is beating down at high noon. The flotilla is taking a pause to rest and rehydrate on a patch of the herbs that they planted last time they were on the Goldfall. The Caldera itself is just becoming visible on the horizon.</p>
    <p>Litoria is sitting atop Sauver as she munches on a small patch of reeds on the riverbank. She is lost in thought, as she usually is. She hears a ripple of water next to her and looks over. One of the Crocodilians who was assigned to scout the river has swum up next to her.</p>
    <p>“Warmaster Litoria,” He speaks in a low voice.</p>
    <p>Litoria perks up at the mention of her formal title. She straightens her back and returns to the present.</p>
    <p>“Weh?” She asks.</p>
    <p>“We was scoutin’ ahead, and we found someone on the bank, we,” He glances back to make sure no one is nearby, “It’s th’ loup garou. Th’ one you told us to keep eyes out for. She was just sittin’ by the bank, with that great razor of hers sittin’ next to her. Like she’s waitin’ for us. We did what you axed, kept her there and went to go get you.”</p>
    <p>He pauses, “Mais, she said she needs to speak to you. Axed me to tell you th’ you was right.”</p>
    <p>“Weh.”</p>
    <p>Litoria interrupts Sauver’s meal. She pulls the hippo back into the river and heads upstream with haste. She knows exactly what Bryti meant, and she knows that Bryti would not have risked contacting her this way unless there was a major threat. Litoria moves as quickly as she can without causing anyone to get suspicious.</p>
    <p>Sure enough, she finds Bryti sitting on the side of the river bank. She is surrounded by four Crocodilians. They have their spears ready and leveled at her, but are keeping a few feet of spacing around her. Bryti’s sword is laying on the riverbank nearby, with one of the Crocodilians standing between her and it. Her arms are crossed.</p>
    <p>Bryti looks up as Litoria arrives, but her expression remains grim as she speaks, “Litoria.”</p>
    <p>“How bad is it?”  Litoria slides off of Sauver and strides over to her informant.  Despite everything else, she trusts Bryti to have an expert opinion on the military situation involving Afflicted, and hopefully to share it with her.  She does not dismiss the guards or tell them to stand down.</p>
    <p>"Dire," she responds, "Far worse than I thought, and far worse than I can handle on my own. I tracked-"</p>
    <p>She starts to move her hand, but freezes as the Crocodilians brace their spears.</p>
    <p>"... I would like to bring out my map, so that I may show your Warmaster the location of a threat."</p>
    <p>Bryti glances to Litoria.</p>
    <p>“Allow it.”  Litoria shoots a level glance around at the Crocodilians.  “<span class="tooltip">Elle est un informateur.<span class="tooltiptext">She's an informant.</span></span>”</p>
    <p>The Crocodilians look concerned, but follow their Warmaster's orders. They lower their spears, but keep them at the ready.</p>
    <p>Bryti slowly removes a map from her belt pouch. She unfolds it and shows it to Litoria. There is a black mark on it along the river west of Winter Quarters. The mark is alarmingly close to where Winter Quarters would be if it were shown on her map. </p>
    <p>“Thank you,” Bryti resumes, “I tracked several of the smaller groups of afflicted I have encountered back to one source. There is a very large group of afflicted, mostly humans and hobgoblins, moving east along this river.”</p>
    <p>She gives Litoria a pointed look at that sentence, but continues, “I estimate their numbers as at least two hundred, possibly three. They appear to all be former soldiers and are moving as an organized group. They appear to be… forcibly foraging as they go. The group is mostly humans, who appear to be former Imperial soldiers. Judging by their equipment and bearing, I would say conscripts. Light armor, shields, shortspears. Not well trained, but the affliction makes them wild and strong. The hobgoblins, on the other hand, appear to have been professional soldiers. They are better trained and equipped, and seem to be maintaining some form of order and discipline even with the affliction. Heavier chain and shields, along with scimitars. A big hobgoblin who appears able to stay in hybrid form most of the time seems to be in control of the whole lot."</p>
    <p>She pauses, "If they keep moving east along that river, I am worried that they will hit some of the blade elf farms near the Fort. There are far too many for me to stop on my own. You're the only one who would listen to me long enough for me to warn you. Will you help me?”</p>
    <p>Litoria listens with intense focus.  She taps a spot on the map, between the Horde and where Winter Quarters should be, but on the Goldfall River nearer to Ft. Alfyr.</p>
    <p>“If we set en ambush, ken you force em into et?”  The answer to Bryti’s question is assumed, Litoria needs to work out the details of how to do it now.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I think so,” She nods, “The hobgoblins are well trained, but the humans are less disciplined. I can direct them, for a time. It will be dangerous, but the hobgoblins won’t be willing to hold out without the rest of their, hm, horde. They will look for something they think is defensible, something they can put their backs to so I can’t get around them.”</p>
    <p>“The Goldfall will do.”  Litoria gestures for the Crocodilian who brought the message to come closer and look at the map.  “If’n we sit up in this bend, we’ll draw em away from...” she makes a vague gesture, “You thinkin’ we ken get back downstream fast nuff?”</p>
    <p>He bends to look where the Warmaster points, and then gives a brief nod, all professionalism.</p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Ca c'est bon.<span class="tooltiptext">That's good.</span></span>”  She looks back to the werewolf.  “What signal you want use for springin’ tha trap?”</p>
    <p>Bryti chews on her lip as she looks at the map, “That… is a very long distance to drive them. It will probably take me at least a few weeks, but during that time they won’t be moving east. As for the signal…”</p>
    <p>She raises an eyebrow, “I have a very unique howl. You won’t miss it.”</p>
    <p>The Crocodilian glares.  Litoria shrugs.</p>
    <p>“If’n it’s too much ta ask, lemme know, weh?  We’re solvin both are problems here.”</p>
    <p>Bryti gives the small gap on the map that represents a very, very long distance a troubled look.</p>
    <p>“I have to,” She answers, “I don’t see any other way. This scourge has to be eliminated, and I can’t do that alone.”</p>
    <p>She takes a steadying breath, and gives Litoria a serious look, “This is my purpose. This is what I am <i>for</i>. I will make this happen, if it is what you need.”</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria nods curtly.  “Mais, we’ll get to it nah.”  She stands and returns to Sauver’s side.</p>
    <p>“Let’er go.  We’ve got work to do.”</p>
    <p>The Crocodilians give each other another odd look, then step back and form up around Litoria.</p>
    <p>“Litoria?” Bryti asks as she folds the map and places it in her pouch again, “I will be on the field with your forces. This is not a battle I can wait out. I have oaths to keep. Can I trust your forces not to kill me?”</p>
    <p>She eyes the Crocs cooly. </p>
    <p>Litoria returns her gaze.</p>
    <p>“Ain’t murdered no allies yet.  Not gonna start now.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods, “Then you are right. We have work to do. I will see you on the other side.”</p>
    <p>Litoria gives a brief wave, and hops onto her hippopotamus.  “Calestros watch ‘er,” she murmurs under her breath.</p>
    <p>Bryti watches the group leave from the shore. As they disappear back down the river, she turns to leave. She takes Luna’s holy symbol out from where it was hidden under her cloak and displays it around her neck again. She pauses to run her fingers along the iron beads attached to the cord.</p>
    <p>“... Please guide me.”</p>
    <p>She takes her wolf form and begins her hunt.</p>
