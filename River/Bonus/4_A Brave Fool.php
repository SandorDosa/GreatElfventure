    <h1>A Brave Fool</h1>
    <p><i>Forty years ago</i></p>
    <p>The wind blowing through Novarsk was cold and sharp. It usually was, but this particular morning it was bad enough that it cut through even Bryti's thick fur. There were chunks of sleet in the wind, even though summer was barely over. It would be a cold winter, probably with several feet of snow for most of the season. Not pleasant.</p>
    <p>Bryti stood in the entry arch for the temple of Luna and gathered herself for the walk back down the steps to her family's manor and hearth. The temple was a modest one, but still the second highest building up the hillside next to the citadel. It was a long path of slick stone steps to the huddled wooden buildings of the town proper, and the sleet was picking up.</p>
    <p>The wind whistled through the archway and one of the priests shouted about her letting the cold in. Bryti shrugged the hood of her cloak over her ears and closed the door behind her. She stepped out of the archway carefully and began her long slow walk back home.</p>
    <p>She was about halfway down the stairs when she noticed a figure leaving the Citadel. It was a hulking black shape, trimmed in red. Even with the bad weather and from that distance, she could easily tell who it was.</p>
    <p><i>Hel</i>, Bryti grit her teeth and sped up her pace, <i>What is he doing here?</i></p>
    <p>The figure was already passing the temple, moving towards her. She wasn't sure if he had seen her. She pulled her cloak tighter over her head, turned her back to him, and made sure her tail was tucked under her cloak. She briefly considered shifting into her elven form, but he would definitely notice the height difference. She moved quickly but confidently. You don't run from a predator like that.</p>
    <p>She was close enough to home to smell the hearth and see the front door when he caught up to her. He wasn't trying to be stealthy, and the pad of his feet told her he well knew what he was doing. Bryti placed a hand on the hilt of her bastard sword, took one last look at home, and turned to face General Dreyrugr.</p>
    <p>The black-furred werewolf towered over her; even as tall as she was her ears barely came up to his shoulders. Not to mention even not counting the red and black cloak and armor he easily weighed at least a hundred pounds more than her, if not two. His yellow eyes bored into her, with a look that naggingly made her feel like prey.</p>
    <p><i>Not me</i>, she forced the feeling away, <i>I have the same bloodright you do, beast.</i></p>
    <p>Bryti took a breath and stood her ground. She met the mad general's eyes and planted her feet. She didn't move a muscle, waiting on him to act. She felt his gaze burn into her, and she forced herself to stand strong. You don't show fear in front of a predator. Dreyrugr broke into a predatory grin. Hel, had he sharpened his teeth?</p>
    <p>"I see Leysa has finally failed to hide you from me," Dreyrugr's voice was a low growl, "She was right to. You <i>are</i> of the blood, even coming from such a meager family line."</p>
    <p>"I am," Bryti's voice sounded more confident than it felt, "And it is nothing important to you. If you've heard about me, you know I've taken the oath of a Purifier. I am not going to participate in politics."</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr's chuckle sounded like grating stone, "You already <i>are</i>, bitch. You participated in politics by being born. Besides, you and I both know how Lycans treat oaths."</p>
    <p>Bryti frowned, "General, though I am of the bloodline, I am genuinely only interested in my service to Luna. If you are concerned about a new member of the bloo-"</p>
    <p>The back of Dreyrugr's hand connected with Bryti's chin. She hadn't even seen him start moving. It felt like she'd taken a hit from a warhammer. Her feet were off the ground.</p>
    <p>Stars swam in her eyes as her paws contacted the wet stone. Her feet were sure. She settled into a crouch and took a measured step back from Dreyrugr. Her bastard sword cleared the sheath as the stars cleared her vision. She fell into a defensive stance, holding the bastard sword at eye level with both hands.</p>
    <p>"Don't suggest I would ever be afraid of a puppy like you," Dreyrugr's voice was calm, his sword still sheathed, "I will do to you whatever I want, no matter what you say about Luna. You feel the call of your blood same as I, and I will <i>concern</i> myself with whether I should kill you now or wait until you give me a better excuse."</p>
    <p>Bryti raised her sword until it nearly touched Dreyrugr's nose, "You are a guest in another wolf's home. Act like a beast and-"</p>
    <p>"<i>Silversheen</i>," Dreyrugr growled at her, eyeing the length of Bryti's rune-covered bastard sword.</p>
    <p>"Yes, silver," Bryti growled back, "Purifiers have leave from the church to carry it."</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr's hand shot forward and wrapped around the blade. He turned his arm and wrenched it, trying to twist it out of her hands. She locked her shoulders and pulled back with both hands. He didn't budge.</p>
    <p>"Silver<i>sheen</i> not silver. Don't talk down to me, bitch. Silversheen is a rebel invention. Are you a rebel?"</p>
    <p>"No," Bryti grunted.</p>
    <p>She would have had a wittier response, but Dreyrugr was currently trying to pull her off her feet. Even with just one hand on the blade, he was nearly lifting her off the ground. She twisted the sword and leaned into it. She felt the blade bite his hand, saw a sliver of fresh blood trickle down the edge of the blade and fill the engraved runes.</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr chuckled again. He leaned his immense weight into the blade. Bryti leaned into it and twisted the blade again. The trickle of blood became a flow, but Dreyrugr didn't care. Bryti felt like her fingers were going to break. The sword was bending at an increasingly alarming angle. He still only had one hand on it. How in Hel was he this strong?</p>
    <p>Bryti didn't have time to process that before Dreyrugr lunged into action. With one hand still clamped around the blade, he stepped forward and slammed an open hand into Bryti's chest. She gasped as the wind was knocked out of her. He clamped his fingers down on her breastplate and lifted her bodily off the ground with one hand.</p>
    <p>With a sneer, Dreyrugr slammed Bryti to the ground on her back. Her vision went black as her head hit one of the stairs with a crack. The remaining air rushed from her lungs and she gasped to breathe.</p>
    <p>The bastard sword was still in Dreyrugr's hand, covered in his own blood and still just slightly bent. He flipped it to hold the hilt, giving it a contemplative look while Bryti struggled to get air in her and her feet under her.</p>
    <p>"Silversheen… so, you attacked me with a silversheen blade while I was leaving a meeting with your mother. Completely unprovoked attack. You were probably a rebel sympathizer. I was of course forced to kill you," He shrugged, "A thin story, but I'll make it stick. People don't like disagreeing with me."</p>
    <p>Bryti had struggled to her knees, but still couldn't speak. She saw Dreyrugr grip the blade.</p>
    <p>"Grow the <i>fuck</i> up, Dreyrugr," a female voice called out behind him.</p>
    <p>Both he and Bryti turned. A blade elf woman with braided white hair and black eyes, wearing her swordelf armor and longsword, stood behind him with an unimpressed expression and her arms folded.</p>
    <p><i>Katya</i> Bryti still couldn't speak.</p>
    <p>Katya returned her injured sister's desperate look before turning her gaze to Dreyrugr.</p>
    <p>"Maybe the reason you keep finding plots against you everywhere is because you keep making them yourself."</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr sniffed and wrinkled his nose, "You're eager to die, elf."</p>
    <p>He raised the bastard sword and placed the bloodied edge to Katya's neck.</p>
    <p>"You're a blade elf. You just saw me about to execute the Skati's daughter, and you think I'll hesitate to gut a slave?"</p>
    <p>"First of all," Katya did not even flinch, "You just <i>did</i> hesitate. Second of all, you should learn to read before you haul off and start killing people. Then again, do you ever actually <i>plan</i> anything or just decide who you want to kill and work backwards from there?"</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr growled, "What are you yammering about?"</p>
    <p>"I am <i>also</i> the Skati's daughter," Katya smiled despite the blade to her neck, "And also her eldest child. Leysa adopted me."</p>
    <p>Bryti had gotten air back into her lungs. She had pulled herself into a kneeling position, as well as put a hand on her backup messer sword. Not much against a beast like that, but it was still silver. She made no sudden movements, watching Katya.</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr leaned in with his teeth bared, "I knew that lowly bitch married her slave, but adopting you? She's weak. We should have slaughtered every single blade elf after Indrek's betrayal. You're all tainted by his treachery. I should correct that mistake. I think I'll start with you."</p>
    <p>Katya raised an eyebrow, "See what I said about deciding who you want to kill and working backwards?"</p>
    <p>"Shut your mouth!" The werewolf general barked and twisted the sword. A few drops of blood dribbled down Katya's neck.</p>
    <p>Bryti had brought herself to standing. The messer was in her hand. The blade looked tiny compared to Dreyrugr's massive form. His back was turned but she wasn't sure how much that would help.</p>
    <p>"You brave fool," Dreyrugr lowered his voice, "There's nothing a frail elf like you can do to stop me, so I will-"</p>
    <p>"That's the thing," Katya interrupted, "I <i>do</i> plan things out, and I also have brothers."</p>
    <p>The sound of large paws padding on the ground reached Bryti’s ears. She glanced back up the hillside. Vigr, her older brother, was riding down from the citadel atop his dire wolf. The pale gray werewolf was wearing his full Legion officer’s armor and holding his heavy lance at the ready, as were the six werewolves of their family’s personal guard flanking him.</p>
    <p>The group of wolf cavalry surrounded the trio on the stairs. Vigr guided his wolf forward and leveled his lance at Dreyrugr. He did not dismount, of course, as he would have been dwarfed by the monster.</p>
    <p>“<i>General</i> Dreyrugr,” Vigr spoke in a commanding voice, “Skati Leysa Veraseggr has decided that you have overstayed your welcome in Novarsk. Your personal guard are already being escorted out of the city. You will leave <i>now</i>.”</p>
    <p>Vigr lowered his voice, “And you will get that sword away from my sister’s neck before I take your arm off.”</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr laughed in a mocking, humorless tone, “What, Commander, are you a lowly pup to this slave as well? I would have thought the Legion would have taught you the correct order of this world.”</p>
    <p>“No Dreyrugr,” Vigr’s voice was as steady as the tip of his lance leveled at Dreyrugr’s face, “My family taught me order. You’d understand that if you ever bothered to have one.”</p>
    <p>“What,” Katya cut in with the sword still at her throat, “Dreyrugr, you mean you don’t have anyone willing to ride out at a heartbeat to help you? No family? Is that a personal choice or can you just not find anyone who loves your sorry ass?”</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr ground his teeth loud enough to be clearly audible to everyone.</p>
    <p><i>That was a mistake</i>, Bryti though.</p>
    <p>“I could kill all of you pups,” Dreyrugr’s voice was quiet and calm.</p>
    <p>“I’ve ordered all of our swordelves to take arms and form up in the streets,” Vigr replied, “They have orders to kill you if you are seen without an escort. It’s a long way to the gate from here, Dreyrugr.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t give a damn,” Dreyrugr’s grip on the sword tightened, “You, your damned blade elves, the wolves you rode in on… I’ll kill you all.”</p>
    <p>“So why haven’t you?” Katya asked.</p>
    <p>Dreyrugr gritted his teeth, then stopped. He looked between Vigr, Bryti, and Katya. He made another predatory grin before settling his gaze on Katya and speaking.</p>
    <p>“The dagger and her pack of pups. I am impressed by your nerve, at least, elf.”</p>
    <p>The sword slowly pulled away from Katya’s neck. She still did not flinch as a small trickle of blood ran from the open cut on her neck. Dreyrugr looked calmly back at Bryti and tossed her sword aside.</p>
    <p>“Until next time, pup,” Dreyrugr stated at Bryti, “I won’t forget you.”</p>
    <p>With that, Dreyrugr folded his arms behind him and started padding towards the exit. Vigr nodded to his guards. The wolf cavalry took up ranks around Dreyrugr, escorting him away. The group of siblings watched the mad wolf until his massive bulk was a blot in the distance of Novarsk’s streets.</p>
    <p>“Oh my gosh, that was <i>awesome!</i>” </p>
    <p>The last of Bryti’s siblings, her little brother Fyrir, came bolting out of his hiding place on the nearby rocky hillside. The scrawny adolescent werewolf tackled Katya with a hug. Katya swayed heavily on the slick stairs before sitting with a thud. Her little brother hugged her by the neck, rambling about how brave she was.</p>
    <p>“Luna’s <i>eyes</i>, Katya!” Vigr dismounted his wolf and walked over to the group, “Do you have any idea who that <i>was</i>?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Katya hissed through clenched teeth and tried to hide her shaking, “I definitely know who that was. Gods. Did you see his eyes?”</p>
    <p>“That was insane, Katya,” Vigr took an unsteady breath, “I’ve read the reports about him. He wasn’t exaggerating. He could have killed all of us if he really wanted. Easily.”</p>
    <p>“He was going to kill Bryti,” Katya stated calmly.</p>
    <p>Vigr turned to Bryti. He opened his mouth as if to argue, but then saw her battered state and dented armor.</p>
    <p>“Is… is that a handprint?” He gawked at the condition of her breastplate.</p>
    <p>Bryti looked down. Indeed, Dreyrugr had grabbed her armor so firmly that she could see the outline of the heel of his hand right over the top of her family’s crest. She looked to her bastard sword on the ground, still bent. She took a few deep breaths.</p>
    <p>“Your neck,” Bryti walked over to Katya and sat next to her.</p>
    <p>“It’s a scratch, really,” Katya ran her fingers through the dripping blood, “I’m not even sure he was actually trying to cut me or if that’s just gentle for a guy like that.”</p>
    <p>“The blade had some of his blood on it,” Bryti insisted, “Let me check you over.”</p>
    <p>“Bryti, the odds of that are…” Katya looked into her sister’s eyes, “... Fine, I’ll be good.”</p>
    <p>The wound indeed wasn’t deep, but it was still dangerous. Bryti traced a few symbols over it with her fingers, mimicking runes. She traced some of the blood away and sealed the wound, both against the affliction and to heal it. As the small dose of pale energy healed her sister, Bryti closed her eyes and concentrated. When she opened them, she saw the world bathed in the same pale light. She looked for the tangled mass of black that would indicate an affliction. She saw nothing.</p>
    <p>“You are safe,” Bryti nodded.</p>
    <p>“It still creeps me out when your eyes do that,” Katya muttered, “It doesn’t look like you.”</p>
    <p>Bryti blinked the blue glow out of her eyes, “It still is, I promise.”</p>
    <p>“I think it looks really cool,” Fyrir murmured from his hug, “You guys are all way cooler than me.”</p>
    <p>“Give it time, scruff,” Vigr sat on the stairs next to Bryti, “You’ll be stronger than all of us I’m sure of it.” </p>
    <p>Vigr smiled at Bryti, “Sorry I snapped. You know I’ll always be here to bail you out, snowfluff.” </p>
    <p>Vigr ruffled his little sister's ears like she was a puppy, even though she was nearly a head taller than him now.</p>
    <p>Bryti snorted a laugh, “I know, Vigr, you sure won’t let me forget.”</p>
    <p>Katya leaned forward and grabbed the hilt of Bryti’s sword. She passed the blade back to her sister. Bryti noted that the blade was indeed badly damaged. She could see what almost looked like grooves where Dreyrugr’s fingers had gripped the blade. She shuddered.</p>
    <p>“What a monster,” Bryti whispered, “I am so thankful for you all.”</p>
    <p>Katya leaned over and dragged her sister into the hug. Vigr placed a hand on her back. Bryti took a few shaky breaths, placed her sword down, and hugged them back. The siblings sat quietly for a few moments before Katya glanced at Vigr.</p>
    <p>“Say,” she asked, “What <i>was</i> that maniac doing here?”</p>
    <p>Vigr shook his head, “He’s going after some rebel cell. In a place called Muspelham. Tried to call mother out to force her to help him. Didn’t work. Especially won’t work, now that she knows he tried to kill Bryti on the way out.”</p>
    <p>A concerned look passed over Katya’s face, but passed quickly.</p>
    <p>“Father wouldn’t do that kind of work no matter what he threatened them with,” Katya glanced back up the hill, “He knows how Dreyrugr operates…”</p>
    <p>Vigr simply nodded.</p>
    <p>“Come on,” Katya smiled, “I’m sick of this damned weather. Let’s get inside to the hearth, get some warm food. I even won’t complain when you spend another three hours cleaning and fixing your sword, Bryti.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, the cold is getting to me, too,” Brytil picked up her sword, “Let’s get moving.”</p>
    <p>"Ooh," Fyrir dropped of Katya's neck, "And I can tell everyone how my badass sister mouthed off to <i>Dreyrugr</i> with a sword to her neck! You looked so cool!"</p>
    <p>"Keep that quiet, scruff," Vigr put a hand on his younger brother's shoulder, "Dreyrugr is a dangerous man. We don't want to anger him any more than we already have."</p>
    <p>"Aw," Fyrir deflated, "Fiiiine."</p>
    <p>Vigr looked up to Bryti. They shared a worried look.</p>
    <p>"Come on, fuzzbutts," Katya stood and started walking towards home, "Let's go home."</p>
    <p>The pack settled in behind the dagger. The elf led her werewolf siblings home.</p>
