    <h1>A Familiar Stranger</h1>
    <p>“A mercenary.”</p>
    <p>Corporal Kass casually flips through the strange blade elf’s papers once again. Grandmaster Indrek’s signature is clear and correct, of course, but even if it’s genuine the rest of the documentation might be forged. The merc’s story doesn’t sit well with him, and her attitude is bothering him. There are plenty of strange characters about, and wolf elves had tried to enter the fort several times. Kass is merely trying to be thorough.</p>
    <p>Or maybe he just doesn’t like mercenaries.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” the merc, identified as Katya Vostok, growls at him with an unnecessary amount of force, “A mercenary.”</p>
    <p>“Interesting,” Kass doesn’t look at her as he flips through the pages, “So, what foreign government do you serve?”</p>
    <p>“Excuse me?” she states, with, once again significantly more force than necessary.</p>
    <p>Kass tries to ignore the fact that something about the way she’s staring at him makes the hair on the back of his arms stand up. Damned merc is probably used to shoving people around and yelling at people and getting her way. Well, not today. Kass has a job to do. Kass forces himself to keep his composure and keep reading the papers with a dull, uninterested expression.</p>
    <p>“A mercenary,” he explains with deliberate pedantry, “Is a professional soldier hired by a foreign country. You’re a blade elf and a professional soldier, I can only assume, so if you’re a mercenary, what foreign power do you serve and why are you trying to bring it to Fort Alfyr?”</p>
    <p>The mercenary (he refuses to think of her as Katya or Vostok) hisses out a breath through her teeth, then growls, “I’m currently between armies.”</p>
    <p>“Ah,” he notes, “So, you’re a homeless, jobless, wanderer then?”</p>
    <p>“I work for a living,” she replies, “I intend to find work here. Check the papers. I have a recommendation from the Triumvirate from my last job.”</p>
    <p>“I see,” Kass flips to the page with the Hunger’s seal. He glances at her breastplate, noting the large hole in the abdomen that appears to have been hastily hammered back in place, "Your talent is apparent."</p>
    <p>"I was <i>hoping</i> to find a smith here who can work mithral and repair my armor," she explains through clenched teeth.</p>
    <p>"What," he looks back up at her, "Does your company not have smiths?"</p>
    <p>"I am not part of a mercenary company," she enunciates slowly.</p>
    <p>"You're not? So you’re a homeless, jobless, wanderer who meanders from place to place getting paid money to hit random things with a sword.”</p>
    <p>There is a long pause.</p>
    <p>“Don’t you <i>fucking</i> say-” the mercenary starts to shout.</p>
    <p>“- You’re an <i>adventurer</i>.” Kass states the word with dripping contempt.</p>
    <p>The <i>adventurer</i> makes a frustrated muffled snarling noise and wrings her hands at Kass, but then lowers her arms. She takes several very long breaths and closes her eyes.</p>
    <p>“<i>Fine</i>,” she relents, “I am an <i>adventurer</i>. I am looking for work. Are you going to let me in or not?”</p>
    <p>“We don’t need adventurers here,” Kass declares, “Such undisciplined rowdiness isn’t needed. Blade elves are quite capable of solving whatever… <i>monster</i> issues might arise.”</p>
    <p>“Then you won’t mind me dropping a few coins at a tavern and being on my way,” she answers.</p>
    <p>“No, but there’s no reason to allow you to cause trouble,” Kass notes, “I see no reason to let you pass.”</p>
    <p>The adventurer grimaces and turns away from him for a few moments. Kass notes the sword on her back. Looks like a swordelf by trade. She’s probably pretty dangerous with it. He doesn’t think she’ll try to rush the gates or something, but…</p>
    <p>She turns back around and folds her arms. She looks him over from head to toe.</p>
    <p>“I’m not here to talk to blade elves,” she explains, “I’m here to talk to river elves. Their flotilla is parked inside. They know me there. That’s why I’m here.”</p>
    <p>“They’re leaving in a few months,” Kass explains, “Surely you can-”</p>
    <p>With an audible grit of teeth the adventurer leans in and snarls, “I am late for an invitation to see my girlfriend for the first time in a year and you are <i>getting. In. My. <b>Way</b>.</i>”</p>
    <p>Kass realizes he has taken a few steps back. When did that happen? He looks over her papers again. His hunch was that she had been hiding something. A blade elf adventurer with a river elf girlfriend on the side probably counts. He had gotten <i>something,</i> right? Probably not a wolf elf. Right. Protocol <i>did</i> say he should let her in. Yeah.</p>
    <p>His hands definitely do not shake as he hands the paperwork back to her.</p>
    <p>“Welcome to fort Alfyr, Miss Vostok.”</p>
    <p>“<i>Thank</i> you.”</p>
    <p>Vostok takes the papers, folds them neatly, tucks them under her cloak, and marches into Fort Alfyr. Kass realizes he has been holding his breath for a few seconds. He relaxes a bit.</p>
    <p>Corporal Kass is good at his job. He is sure of it.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>A blade elf encampment is always much the same, no matter how big it is or where it is. You can visit any number of soldier camps around the world and find something similar to it, but not quite exactly the same. Everyone moves with a purpose, everyone has their assignments, everything has its place. It looks like chaos, but it's organized. Everything has ceremony and placement, up to and most certainly including the things that have no official purpose or are against regulations.</p>
    <p>It’s chaotic in the way that the blood vessels in your hand are chaotic. If you glance at them, they seem like so much string slapped out every which way. If you pay close attention, you could see that each piece is oh so carefully arrayed to get everything where it needs to go, a product of necessity. So efficient is this that you could even tell it was a hand, if all you could see was that.</p>
    <p>Because of this subtle organization, the river elf rafts stick out like a smudge on a painting. The rafts are laid out nearly in the middle of town, some docked and others pulled onshore. Nearby all of them, river elves appear to laze about, feeding their gators, eating food so spicy you can feel it in the air, or just kind of sitting or laying there. This, you have to remember, is the <i>military</i>. If you’re paying attention, you can tell that they all have their eyes up and heads on swivels at all times. If you’re <i>really</i> paying attention you might see the ones in the water, keeping their Eyes on you.</p>
    <p>Katya sees a raft that is familiar to her. She makes a straight line for it, cutting through the currents of chaos and organization like a knife. She does not make eye contact or seem to acknowledge any other blade elves. She is given space, and plenty of odd looks. There is a scowl on her face.</p>
    <p> The roofline of the Hylidae family raft stands out. She slows down a little bit as she approaches. As she crosses the invisible line to river elf territory, the scowl fades. She steps up onto the raft and knocks on the wall near the door.</p>
    <p>"You done fetched them peppers real quick, Acris. I thought fo shore you was gonna be-" Smilisca pulls back the curtain and is startled into silence.</p>
    <p>"Mais, if this is abou another insubordination even' I ain't gonna hear it. Th' 'prentice ain't in your military an he ain't gotta follow any order any ol' captain hands 'im." The wizard folds his arms across his chest and gives his very best stern gaze. "I handle 'is discipline myself, me, an your lot ain't gotta interfere."</p>
    <p>The stranger at the door chuckles and raises an eyebrow, "Why Smilisca, does Acris know how fast you're willing to throw down the dagger for him?"</p>
    <p>Smilisca eyes the stranger with suspicion, taking in her attire, her attitude, and her expression.  The voice seals it.</p>
    <p>“Non, not a word.”  He grins and offers a hug to the very familiar blade elf.  “I’d deny every bit o’ it if’n you told, me.”</p>
    <p>Bryti laughs and gives him a hearty embrace, "I will guard this dark secret with my very life, I so swear. It's good to see you, Smilisca." </p>
    <p>“Good t’see you too, cher.”  Smilisca returns the hug happily.  “Th’ disguise is lookin good.  Y’fooled me real real good, weh.”  He turns back into the raft’s workroom.  “Y’eat yet?”</p>
    <p>"No, and I have missed river elf food," she glances behind her, "Let's head inside before anyone starts wondering why Katya the mercenary is hugging river elves."</p>
    <p>“Katya cain’t have no friends, non,” Smilisca laughs as the curtain falls behind them.  His little workspace is not much different than she recalls the multipurpose kitchen, navigator’s workshop, and apprentice lecture hall.  There’s a fresh blue stain across the desk space in front of the window, and the supply of various herbs and incenses looks to be extremely low.</p>
    <p>“Litoria’ll be here af’er they done finish up practice fer the afternoon.  She’s got a new crop’a eels in trainin, mais theys needs all the help they ken git.”</p>
    <p>"That's the truth for sure," Bryti moves confidently, as this is a place she belongs. She removes her boots and leans her sword against the wall, causing the illusion to slide off it and reveal the real blade.</p>
    <p>She sits down comfortably at the table and shakes her head, "Strange things are happening out there, that's for certain. The wolf elves had deliberately afflicted the dark elf spymaster, and were trying to use him as bait for me."</p>
    <p>She taps the hammered out punch through in her armor, "Then it got stranger…" </p>
    <p>“Mais!  Whatchu do t’git a hole like that?  Git in a fight wi’ a blacksmith?”  Smilisca traces the edge of the hole with a finger, trailing a faint glow of blue magic.  He covers the hole with his webbed palm and whispers some quiet Sylvan while waiting for Bryti to answer.</p>
    <p>When he takes his palm away, the hole has closed completely.</p>
    <p>"Huh," Bryti blinks as the armor seals itself back together. The area around the hole glows, and an inscription partially returns. It is a single wolf, sitting in a howling pose to the side.</p>
    <p>"I suppose I'll have to buff that out again," she rubs a thumb over the wolf thoughtfully, "Won't do to go running around as a Vostok with a Veraseggr sigil…"</p>
    <p>She looks at it a moment before looking back up to Smilisca, "But no, not a blacksmith. I got in a fight with an undead dragon."</p>
    <p>“An undead... dragon?”  Smilisca leans back on his cushion.  “You sure do attrac’ em big big dramas, weh <i>Tourist</i>?”</p>
    <p>She laughs in reply, "Don't look at me, all I did was get pinned to a wall and survive a few claw swipes. Shyrendora took its head off. With a <i>dagger</i>."</p>
    <p>“Mais, of <i>course</i> she did.”  Smilisca rolls his eyes dramatically.  “Tha’ little spook’s got more fight in her eartip ‘en half th’ new recruits got in them’s whole bodies.”  He pulls something still wriggling out of the live well in the floor and dumps it in a stoneware crock with salt and spices to marinate to death.  “Mais don’t tell ‘em I say it though, non, you ain’t heard that from me either.”</p>
    <p>Bryti mocks a salute, "Orders received."</p>
    <p>She pauses, "It's good to have someplace that feels like home." </p>
    <p>“Weh...” Smilisca looks thoughtfully toward his many ropes of river maps that now hang from hooks on the wall.  “...Fer as long as we’re here, weh.”</p>
    <p>She follows his gaze to the river maps, which she still only vaguely understands.</p>
    <p>"What," she turns back to him, "are you planning on going somewhere?"</p>
    <p>“D’you miss home?” he asks instead, deflecting while waiting on a slowly marinating squid.</p>
    <p>"Every day," she answers quietly, "Every hour, wake or sleep." </p>
    <p>“Weh.”  The wizard stands and heads into the sleeping room.  He fetches a different rope from a chest bolted to the floor.  “There’s a chance,” he says, very cautiously, “an it a slim one, it.  I ain’t known what’s gon’ be decided, but you should know it’s - mais, it’s gon’ be decided.”  He shows her the old rope, its colors faded from years in the sun.</p>
    <p>The werewolf leans back and looks at the rope. Even to someone only vaguely familiar with river maps, the length and age of the rope makes it plainly obvious what it is. She stares at it for several long moments.</p>
    <p>"Smilisca…" she looks at him, "I have to stay here."</p>
    <p>“Weh, I know, me.”  He sits down and gently caresses the thickly detailed current map in his hands.  “An it’s useless t’ say it.  I ain’t gon’ lie t’ya.  If’n I could git there I’d go.  Mais - but we done built so much o’er here too now.  We weren’t meant t’ stay in one place ever.”</p>
    <p>“Bu’ I’d like t’ go back en put the dream t’ rest.”  He’s quiet for a moment.  “Mais.  I’d be back here soon ‘nuff, me.  I can’t talk for none other.”</p>
    <p>Bryti folds her hands on the table. It's a few long moments before she replies.</p>
    <p>"Thank you for telling me that, Smilisca. I understand. I can't go back, but if I could I would do so in a heartbeat. You have to do what is best for you, and what is best for your people."</p>
    <p>She does an admirable job of pretending to be okay. </p>
    <p>“I ain’t gon’ tell you what’ta do with that information, non.”  Smilisca pats the braid again and then leaves to go carefully put it away again.  “Mais, you should know.”</p>
    <p>She nods to him, "I am only one wolf. You have a whole culture to take care of. Don't worry about me. I will be fine."</p>
    <p>It might be true.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The day is winding down when Smilisca and Bryti make their way to the practice yard.  The deep green tarnish hasn’t fully taken on the copper-washed armor worn by the newly recruited Eels, and they sparkle in the fading light.</p>
    <p>Ehra Indrek stands next to Litoria and Sauver as they watch the recruits work through a shield formation drill. The recruits are obviously inexperienced, but showing promise. Or, at least, holding their shields the right way.</p>
    <p>Bryti walks up to Litoria and Ehra. She gives them both a salute, and gives Ehra a formal but cold bow.</p>
    <p>"Grandmaster," she greets him flatly before looking at the other elf, "Hey, Litoria."</p>
    <p>"Katya," Ehra returns a salute before Litoria can speak, glancing at her, "Mercenary life agreeable to you?"</p>
    <p>"It pays," she shrugs, "Just passin' through, thought you'd like to know I'm in town."</p>
    <p>Ehra nods and gives her a thoughtful look. Litoria looks concerned, and reaches to give Sauver a pat.</p>
    <p>“You lost your shadow, weh?”  Litoria gives Bryti a slightly hopeful smile.</p>
    <p>"For now, yeah," she returns the smile slightly lopsided, "I'm sure he'll track me down again. Said something about taking a break for winter. We got paid too good in Surt, though. He'll be back. He's good to work with." </p>
    <p>Litoria looks between Ehra and Bryti and back again.</p>
    <p>“Mais, you stayin’ long?”</p>
    <p>"Thinking about it," she looks at Ehra, who gives a slight nod, "Though I get along better with rivers than blades these days. That, and I don't want to pay for a bunk. That's what I was coming to ask, mind if I grab a hammock with a raft? I don't mind working for my share." </p>
    <p>“In this weather, weh,” Litoria answers, keeping up appearances, “Best stick close.  I’ll want t’ hear ‘bout what’s goin’ on in them tunnels.”  She returns her attention to the drills in progress, leaving Bryti with Ehra momentarily.</p>
    <p>Ehra gives her a quizzical look. Bryti gives him another flat, emotionless stare.</p>
    <p>"How are you finding the fort?" He asks her politely, "I am aware that you are following a different career than military life, but you <i>are</i> welcome here."</p>
    <p>"Might want to tell your soldiers that, then," she speaks in a clipped tone, "All I get here is cold shoulders and hard stares."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps that is because you are handing out death glares that could melt steel," Ehra speaks lightly, "I know your past. It doesn't matter here. You're one of us."</p>
    <p>Bryti snorts humorlessly and speaks quietly, "Not really."</p>
    <p>Ehra's smile fades to concern, "I know you don't feel that way, but it is true. Just give it time."</p>
    <p>"Thank you, Grandmaster," she speaks in a voice that betrays nothing.</p>
    <p>Ehra continues the concerned look for a moment before turning to Litoria.</p>
    <p>"Well, Warmaster?" He asks her in a brighter voice, "I'd say the recruits are faring better than we expected."</p>
    <p>Litoria exhales a long string of descriptive complaints in Sylvan.</p>
    <p>“Weh.  I’ll be wantin’ the three greenest here early tomorrow. Thems can use a few extra laps.”  She surveys the recruits on the field, going through their exercises in an orderly fashion.</p>
    <p>The Warmaster flags down an officer with a wave of her long two-pronged spear, currently outfitted with a pennant for signaling purposes.  She gives the younger elf a few quick instructions, and dismisses the soldiers from their training for the day.</p>
    <p>"I'll ensure the arrangements are made," Ehra eyes Bryti slyly as he speaks to Litoria, "Why don't you take the rest of the evening off?"</p>
    <p>Litoria does not hesitate in accepting the offer.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Night has fallen on the Hylidae family raft, along with a fresh layer of snow. With the cold outside, the heavy curtains have been drawn. In the safety of the raft, Bryti has dropped the Katya disguise.</p>
    <p>Smilisca has taken this opportunity to explore some extended negotiation avenues with Fort Álfyr's quartermaster. Acris sent a message: Apparently, he has made a friend. He is now helping her with several days of extended cleaning duties she has racked up.</p>
    <p>Litoria and Bryti have the raft to themselves. Bryti, however, has been uncharacteristically quiet so far. She hasn't been rude or standoffish. Instead, it reminds Litoria of Bryti's first visit. She's polite and pleasant, but gracefully dodges any questions about herself.</p>
    <p>Litoria can’t help but feel like she missed something or that she did something horribly wrong.  Eventually she builds up enough courage to actually ask a question that’s not about the dark elves.</p>
    <p>“Ami,” Litoria says quietly, while pulling extra blankets out of a storage compartment, “Where’re you goin’ next?”</p>
    <p>Bryti exhales quietly before answering, "I… haven't decided."</p>
    <p>Litoria hands Bryti a roughly spun cotton blanket, soft as felt with wear.</p>
    <p>“Arpenter is headin’ inta the badlands again.  Mais, I’m goin’ wi’ em.”  Litoria stops, recognizing that Bryti might not actually be aware of the second flotilla’s movements.  “It’s been real real dangerous out there.”  She pauses again, searching for the right words.</p>
    <p>“N’matter where you go, I want you t’feel like y’got somewhere safe t’go back to.  Like we do.  Like I do.”</p>
    <p>“They’re buildin’ an office et Winter Quarters.  I gave the Beavers orders t’ let you use it anytime you need somewheres to stay - any time of year, weh.  It’s not a <i>house</i> or a secure fortress like Alfyr, but it’s uh, yours any time you want, weh?”</p>
    <p>"That…" Bryti closes her eyes for a moment, "That means a lot to me. Thank you."</p>
    <p>She collects herself for a moment before raising her head and looking Litoria in the eyes.</p>
    <p>"Smilisca told me that you're planning to try to return home."</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria returns her gaze, still holding the blanket.  “Tain’t gon’ lie to you.  If’n there’s anything to return to ‘an we ken git everyone there safely, th’ plan was always t’ go home af’er the war.  Tha’ much ain’t changed.  Mais - me?  I ain’t goin’ ‘less we <i>can</i> get erryone there.  I got a duty t’fill here.”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods in reply. She gently takes the blanket, "Yes, you do. You have a duty to your people, and their well being, and I know that if <i>I</i> could go home I…"</p>
    <p>She stops and gently runs a hand on the soft surface of the blanket, "If… if it's true, and you <i>can</i> go home, I know that you <i>must</i> go home… and you know that I have to stay here."</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria sits down on the hammock.  “There is time between them choices, mais la, en’ we ain’t to know what tomorrow could bring.  Could be I’m dehydrated dead in the badlands, me.  Could be you’re get et by en dragon, non?”</p>
    <p>Bryti laughs quietly at that, then places a hand on the blanket, "All true, but… it's… not that simple for me. I'm a Lycan, and a blade elf. I am a blade elf, loyal to the bitter end. I am a Lycan, I cannot do things partway. Kill what you bite. Finish what you begin. If you start a fight, you end it. If you create something, you make sure it will flourish. And… if you love someone,"</p>
    <p>She looks sadly to Litoria, "... you never stop. I can't… I cant do things halfway. I'm sorry."</p>
    <p>“We’re failing you, aren’t we?” Litoria tries to blink away the tears in her eyes and fails.  “We’re buildin’ somethin’ here an’ we know tha’ we don’ actually want use it.”  She pauses to pinch the web between her fingers.</p>
    <p>“Yer not a second best.”</p>
    <p>Bryti wordlessly sets the blanket aside. She stands, marches directly to Litoria in a perfectly resolute blade elf fashion, and hugs her. And receives a hug in return, without even a hesitation.</p>
    <p>"<i>I know,</i>" Bryti whispers from the tight embrace, "Of course I know. Of course I know you love me. Of course I know it's real. That's why it <i>matters</i>. If it… it weren't something real, then I wouldn't care, but it <i>is</i>… and I can't simply… I can't treat that like a passing ship." </p>
    <p>“I love you, Bryti.”  It comes out as a whisper, muffled by the blade elf’s long white hair.  “I’d... I’d just started t’ think of th’ future.  I forgot where it were s’posed t’ flow.  I... I guess I done assumed that there’re Afflicted errywhere, weh?”</p>
    <p>“I… had started to dare to think about it too,” Bryti admits, “But… there is more than afflicted holding me here. There is a task I am called to, something I cannot ignore. Even if it were not though… Litoria,  I am a werewolf of the bloodline. No matter what you or the other elves think of me, no matter whether it’s right or wrong, I will be hunted for the rest of my days. So will anyone who protects me. Nothing can change that. You, the river elves… you have a future. You have a path ahead of you. It’s not right to risk that, just for one person.” </p>
    <p>“I’d have started a <i>war</i> for you,” Litoria whispers fiercely.  “<small>An’ I ain’t regret it, more I know ‘bout em’s that woulda fought it.</small>  Mais, non non non.  I keep accusin’ you of keepin’ too many secrets.  An I ain’t rightly recognizin’ that we been done the same.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t,” Bryti interjects, “Don’t apologize, don’t start a war for me. Litoria… you’ve given me more than I ever thought I would have, ever again. You’ve given me <i>happiness</i>, and that can’t ever be taken away. I am… and I always will be, just one person. You can’t risk so many lives, just for me. Please. I don’t want anyone to die for my sake.”</p>
    <p>“Would that I could do more.”  Litoria sighs and bites back a sob.  “I shoulda never done thought...”  She pauses, and buries her face in Bryti’s shoulder.  “It doesn’t matter now I guess.”</p>
    <p>“It does,” Bryti whispers, “You reminded me what a home feels like. I never thought I would feel that again.” </p>
    <p>Litoria straightens up, sitting on her own again.</p>
    <p>"I ain't gonna toss you overboard, an I ain't gonna make you stay neither. It's up to you. I can't make you stay, weh."</p>
    <p>"I… would like to stay," Bryti sits back, looking down, "At least during winters. I feel safe with… the flotillas." </p>
    <p>“Meant what I said, me.”  Litoria crosses her arms and looks a bit put down by the implication.  “You ain’t got to leave.  An you’ll always be welcome here.  There’s standin’ orders fer you to have a place at Winter Quarters year round, weh?”</p>
    <p>Bryti nods quietly, “Thank you.”</p>
    <p>She seems as if she is about to say something further, but stops. She does not look directly at Litoria. An uncomfortable silence follows. </p>
