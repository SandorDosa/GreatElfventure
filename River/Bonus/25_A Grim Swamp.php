    <h1>A Grim Swamp</h1>
    <p id="i">Years ago, and miles away...</p>
    <p>Nyctimystes holds her sister’s hand in a tight grasp, their webs straining against each other as silent support.  The water around them is still, not even any minnows darting about to disturb it.  It feels like the swamp is holding its breath.</p>
    <p>She doesn't have to look to feel her sister's confident poise, to sense the tension in her spine and the urgent energy she holds at bay.  The water speaks it into her porous skin.  She nervously waits in total stillness.</p>
    <p>Above them, barely a hippo's length away, monsters tromp down the narrow strip of dry land available. It isn't obvious, not with how carefully they worked, but the path is not a natural one.  Earth has been moved away from it to make the water to its sides deeper.  It was a simple enough task for a behemoth to drag a trenching plow next to an existing path to cut it off from alternate routes. </p>
    <p>The monsters are in the jaws of their trap.  It will not be long now before they close shut.</p>
    <p>Nyctimystes is very thankful that they are not the ones who have to make the call for when to launch the ambush.  That would require taking a less secure position, and actually exposing themselves to the air.  And then they would have time to see their enemy without the rippled distortion of the murky surface of the water above's interference.  It would give her more time to panic, to decide to run, and to live down to her fears.</p>
    <p>They could hear the howls from miles away.  The wolves were not a stealthy army.</p>
    <p>All day long they sit in the ditch, listening through the mud to the heavy footfalls of so many hundreds of paws.  Nyctimystes grows ever more concerned as the monsters just keep coming.  Her sister appears to be increasingly impatient with the wait.  Both young women stay as still as corpses, holding firm their long weapons and knowing that they will ultimately be useless.</p>
    <p>At long last, a ripple passes overhead.  The faint shudder that spawned it was too small to be detected, but its effect is inversely proportional to its import.  That’s the preliminary signal.</p>
    <p>Neither elf moves even to flinch.  To give away their position now could be death.  The monsters above would scent them instantly and destroy the advantage of surprise.  Nyctimystes’s eyes dart toward the surface.  She watches the changing light as the ripple shudders through the murky water.</p>
    <p>There is no secondary signal.</p>
    <p>From the other side of the path, behemoths charge forth from the deeper pools.  Their teams of riders spur the massive beasts into sudden, furious action, and hit the enemy line before it can form ranks.</p>
    <p>River elves are ambush predators.</p>
    <p>The smaller riding hippos join the behemoth’s charge, filling in the gaps between their larger cousins once the way is cleared.  Water and mud churn to foam.  The Crocodilians level viciously barbed spears and drive the startled werewolves from their marching orders to the shallower swamp on the opposite side of the previously safe dry path.</p>
    <p>The mounted Crocodilians manage to inflict little damage in their charge.  Their steel weapons simply cannot pierce through tough Lycanthropic hide.  This is accounted for in the plan.</p>
    <p>Trembling ground distorts the surface view even further.  Nyctimystes feels her sister squeeze her hand for reassurance and then let go.  They hold their positions.  They do not move.</p>
    <p>Panicking wolves, ridden by terrified werewolves enter the shallow water, pushing toward the visibly higher ground just beyond the trench.  Officers bark orders that are swiftly ignored.  No amount of empathy between mount and rider can force even the most monstrous dire wolves to allow themselves to be trampled by the truly massive behemoth hippopotamuses.</p>
    <p>Nyctimystes and her sister do not move.  River elves are ambush predators.  All goes according to plan.</p>
    <p>A paw splashes down into the water within a handspan of Nyctimystes’s spear.  The wolf is within her reach.  And <i>that</i> is all the signal they needed.</p>
    <p>Erupting from their prone positions in the mud, Nyctimystes is a heartbeat behind her sister to drive her long, cruel spear into the exposed belly of the fierce and intelligent wolf.  It’s just a wolf.  It’s just an animal.</p>
    <p>Blood and viscera taste and smell like rust and copper against her skin.  Nyctimystes focuses on the twist, the angle, and then the pull.  Bright pain distracts her, but the training she received was at the hands of master who accepted not even a fractional second of distraction.</p>
    <p>She rips her spear free from the belly of the beast to engage its rider as it falls.  An armored elf flashes past her field of view, tackling the werewolf rider as she shifts forms.</p>
    <p>“Tori!” Nyctimystes manages to shout, catching her sister’s attention before she thrusts her spear into the new wolf.  Thick fur stained red and sodden with swamp water deflects her blow.  The werewolf struggles to bring its weapons to bear upon its elven aggressors.</p>
    <p>It’s a monster, she reminds herself, just a monster.</p>
    <p>The sisters drag the werewolf under the surface.  It twists and squirms in their webbed grasp, snapping and clawing and fighting for its life.  It shifts again.</p>
    <p>In her human shape, the enemy soldier does not have fur to hold as an anchor.</p>
    <p>It was an ineffective strategy.  Her armor provides plenty of handholds for the two aquatic creatures to keep her down where only they belong.  A thick hide and sturdy mithral armor do not defend against drowning.</p>
    <p>It takes longer than she could have imagined.</p>
    <p>It’s over in an instant.</p>
    <p>Nyctimystes refuses to look the drowned soldier in the face.  She instead stands, orienting herself in the battlefield.  A single file column on a narrow path is a worst case scenario for a flanking action.  Not a single wolf will escape.</p>
    <p>When she reaches down to help her sister out of the mud, the bright tangy red of blood catches her eye.  It runs down her arm in a bold stripe against the pale green of her skin.  It draws her eyes downward as the droplets splatter against her sister’s armor.  Her sister’s damaged armor.</p>
    <p>The lamellar plates that guard her vitals have separated and a tooth, ripped from a canine mouth is still embedded between them.  It’s a bite wound, and it’s bleeding.</p>
    <p>“You were bit!”</p>
    <p>The words come out of her mouth, but she hears them echoed to her from a different voice.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Nyctimystes’s joints ache.  The long scraping bite wound across her face aches.  Her everything aches.  The heavy dose of wolfsbane makes her feel even more awful.  And she would complain about all of it, but she’s still alive.  And being assigned the task of collecting the bodies of the enemy dead for burning drives home just how lucky a task that is.</p>
    <p>Dragging wolves, werewolves, and humans alike back onto the raised path, she helps strip them of valuable arms and armor.  What did not protect a werewolf from drowning in perfectly breathable swamp water certainly could keep a sword or a claw from eviscerating elven flesh.  Mithral is hard to get.  There’s no sense in wasting it by letting it burn with a corpse.  With the war having lasted this long so far, it’s only practical to hang onto valuable resources.</p>
    <p>A cousin helps her pile the nude corpses onto the stacks of lumber and kindling that slowly grow down the path.  Pawpaw is busy lighting the flames further down the line.  A brother accepts the scavenged gear from her and carts it off on hippo back to the camp.  Her family is everywhere around her.  It feels safe.  Everything is efficient.  </p>
    <p>The full moon is scant days away. It has to be.</p>
    <p>The work of burning corpses to control the spread of Affliction is grim.  But it is important work.  And at least the enemy dead aren't as difficult to move as is a fallen hippo. Nyctimystes does not envy her sister's shift their task of clearing away the one fallen behemoth before the honored creature attracts significant predators.  It must be butchered, and the offal burned, before the bones can be moved.</p>
    <p>Grim duties, all, but they must be done.</p>
    <p>Preferably before the bonfire.</p>
    <p>Everything already stinks of smoke.  It's enough to feel suffocating.  At least she's still alive. </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Nyctimystes holds her sister’s hand in a tight grasp, their webs straining against each other as silent support.  They sit close to the bonfire's leaping flames, surrounded by others who took injury in the battle.  They are far from alone, and theirs are not the worst injuries.  Other elves give the sisters wide clearance, as it seems the worst of luck for both to have been so obviously bitten.</p>
    <p>The ground around the bonfire is already covered in ash and soapy lumps of clay.  It has churned to mud with all the webbed feet that traveled through it to prepare the pyre.  The spot was chosen for this purpose.  They cannot breathe this thick, airless soup of ash.</p>
    <p>Nyctimystes wishes she could be confident in the face of danger.  She wishes she had her sister’s courage.  Tonight there is no way for her to know more details.  The air between them does not transmit information the way water does.  She steals a glance toward her twin and catches her in the act of doing the same.</p>
    <p>The girls giggle nervously at having been caught, and Nyctimystes nudges the braver elf with her elbow.</p>
    <p>“Any minute now,” her sister whispers, pointing her eyes to the sky.  Clouds of smoke and tall trees obscure the horizon where the traitorous moon will rise.</p>
    <p>Nyctimystes can’t help but feel jealous of her sister’s poise.  How can she just sit there like she doesn’t even worry that her family is going to have to execute her tonight?  Where does that confidence even come from?  How dare she be so horribly virtuous.</p>
    <p>It’s no wonder their master preferred her in training.  Of course everyone would take to the new recruit who learned so quickly.  Wasn’t that head injury supposed to slow her down?  Nyctimystes worked hard and long for her apprenticeship as a Crocodilian.  It wasn’t fair for her sister to be accepted and promoted so quickly.  It wasn’t fair.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t fair.  They were <i>supposed to be the same.</i></p>
    <p>She squeezes her sister’s hand, and sharp nails dig into the soft flesh of its webs.  Surprised, Nyctimystes looks down to spot fine grey fur just beginning to grow from her green-freckled skin.  She tries to let go, but her hand betrays her, gripping tight enough to feel the pop of the joint in her grasp.</p>
    <p>Her sister pulls her off balance.  It’s easier to do than it had ever been in their training sessions.  Her feet aren’t right.  Fur spreads across her face in a wave of prickles against her skin.  Nyctimystes falls flat into the mud.</p>
    <p>A spear thrusts through her side as she tumbles.  That wasn’t her sister’s doing.  The wounded aren’t allowed to hold weapons.  Gasping for breath with part of a lung missing, she snaps sharpening fangs toward the kin-murdering cousin with the spear and fails to reach.  Her claws scrape her sister’s arms, raised in a defensive posture.</p>
    <p>Nyctimystes bites down on one of those arms, and her sister rolls the two of them over into the mud.  The horrible, suffocating mud, tainted with the ash of the already burned dead.  Her growing fur absorbs the thick muck and it clings to her skin, forcing her breath to rely on her only too fragile lungs.</p>
    <p>Her sister takes the upper hand by using her arm trapped in Nyctimystes’s own locked jaw to control her head.  She’s shoved, snout first, into the thick mud, snarling and grinding her fangs into the soft grey flesh.</p>
    <p>Drowning takes so very long.  It’s not fair.</p>
    <p>“<i>I hate you, Litoria,</i>” are the last words she snarls before her entire world is reduced to black, ashy mud.</p>
