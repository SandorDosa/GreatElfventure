    <p>All flotilla return to Winter Quarters for the season.  The reunion of the two is cause for great celebration, a clam bake, and spreads the hippopotamus rumors to all of the river elves.</p>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Prosalirus, Arpenter’s Oarmaster, and the captain of the Crafty Crawfish put their heads together in a damp puddle huddle.  It’s time to turn around and head home, but they want to make a nice impression on the friendly neighborhood dragon.</p>
    <p>The Oarmaster argues in favor of offering a wealth of food stuffs to the dragon in exchange for a quantity of mithral.  The captain suggests that this would be declined, as it is clearly not needed by the locals.  The captain suggests that instead they turn around and come back with something more suitable next year.  Prosalirus tenders the suggestion that Arpenter make an offer of contacting potential trading partners on the dragon’s behalf in exchange for a small cut of their future exchanges.</p>
    <p>The oarmaster and the captain slowly turn in the direction of the elder pathfinder.  And yes, that.  That is the best option.  </p>
    <p>They work up a contract based on pre-Lycan contracts for similar agreements with hobgoblins and humans, carefully crafting the language to name the river elven flotilla at large as the preferred overwater freight method for these future transactions.</p>
    <p>Arpenter attempts to use the <i>Trade Agreement</i> trapping of <b>Trade</b> to improve their relationship with Ankkharavathyr the Magnificent with the suggestion that they will be able to facilitate an ordering process with him and other continental elves in the following year.  This rolls 2 Ability dice and 1 Proficiency die: 2 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Fuckin’ spies, man.  <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> rolls 2 Ability dice: 1 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs.</p>
	<p><b>Military: </b>Prosalirus hears the grumblings of his companions on Arpenter.  He knows that they can see a way across the forbidding terrain between them and... Home.  This reptile-infested Eastern desert is not his idea of paradise.  The precious wetlands with their cultivated floating islands, herds of healthy hippopotami, and oh look there he goes daydreaming of the Western lands again.</p>
	<p>But there is that treaty.  And if they’re going to break it, they best be cautious about it.  No sense getting a elven-human war started if the Western home has already been totally destroyed by the resettlement.  There’s nobody there to tend the marsh plants.  Nobody’s managing the hippo breeding programs.  Noone is left to prevent destructive habitation practices in the fragile ecosystem, and oh no the maudlin distraction again.  Get it together, old man, we need a plan here.</p>
	<p>Yes.  This is going to have to be done with extra care.  He and the captain of the Crafty Crawfish work on instilling in the elves of Arpenter some cautious optimism.  Next year, they promise, we’ll visit the central fork and see just how far this route can reach.</p>
	<p>As Arpenter passes through the fork in the river on the way back to Winter Quarters, the pathfinders carefully scout the terrain for signs of hippos and refugees, while quietly piling cairns on the riverbank to mark the directions they have already investigated.</p>
	<p>Arpenter again attempts some scouting using the <i>Pathfinders</i> trapping of <b>Reconnaissance</b> and rolls 2 Ability dice: 2 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> When the flotilla converge, Smilisca had been stewing in his argument with Staurois over their differences in opinions on governmental philosophy.  That argument evaporates as soon as the two hear tales of hippos in the badlands.</p>
    <p>That’s a new project for the academic wizard and the empathetic druid to work together on.  Staurois pulls together the experts in Winter Quarters who have been maintaining the Wildlife and Fisheries in the flotilla’s absence.  Even Litoria puts her significantly less shabby looking than the wizard’s hideous hat in the ring to help.</p>
    <p>There are hippos out there.  They just need to know where to look.  Using the <i>Research</i> trapping of <b>Academics</b>, and invoking the <i>Wildlife and Fisheries</i> terrain aspect at Winter Quarters, they seek to get a better idea of where to start the quest for hippopotamuses and roll: 2 Ability and 1 Proficiency dice: 4 advantage, 0 successes, 1 triumphs.</p>
    <p><b>Character:</b> Litoria requisitions a treehouse as an office and home-away-from-Acris in Winter Quarters.  She asks the captain of the Brave Beavers to pick a tree close to the defensive perimeter, where her office would be easily accessible when needed by the military, and not too close to where more civilians park their rafts.</p>
    <p>It’s an office, she insists, it just needs to be large enough to hold meetings.  And if they’re building it that large anyway, it might as well have a place to sleep.  And if it’s going to have sleeping quarters, they should probably go ahead and install the needed storage traps for a little kitchen area.  And oops I guess this office is now something more like a house.</p>
    <p>To keep up the illusion that she’s not commissioning a new home just to get away from her cousin, she asks that it all be one room.  That maximizes the available space so she can hold important strategy meetings with her officers.  Yep.  That’s why.</p>
    <p><b>Character:</b> Prosalirus meets with Litoria toward the end of the season.  They hold a tense discussion behind the tree where her office has begun to be constructed.  They discuss for a long period of time the risks of adventuring out across the treaty border.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b>As it turns out Ankkharavathyr quite likes Prosalirus. The elder pathfinder’s instincts are good. Trying to do a trade with the dragon right now would have been dicey at best, but Fool’s Fortune seems to be a pretty stable settlement with nothing desperately needed at the moment. Ankkh turns out to be extremely enthusiastic (to an unnerving degree, somewhat, considering how much his teeth move when he talks,) about the prospects of future trade.</p>
    <p>Like any good dragon, Ankkh is planning for the future. Like any good lawful dragon, he absolutely loves contract negotiation. Thankfully, due to his youth, he doesn’t have quite the legendary negotiation skills that some elders maintain. He is, however, a shrewd customer. You have the benefit that you’re genuinely trying to set up a mutually beneficial trade agreement, however, so things go smoothly.</p>
    <p>Ankkh doesn’t commit to any kind of exclusivity, but he does agree to note the river elves as his preferred trade partner for large and heavy shipments. He doesn’t have any boats and there are few roads in the badlands, making a flotilla extremely useful for transporting large heavy shipments of ore. He is also very enthusiastic about the goods that the other elves may have to offer, and happy to agree to the river elves serving as a go-between to communicate what may be available. </p>
    <p>The actual goods exchanged and agreements made are pretty basic, but that’s not really the point. Like any good trader, the river elves know that connections are worth far more than coin, and in that you made great strides. Ankkh enjoyed interacting with the river elves, and now sees you as a serious trading partner. Considering he’s an extremely long lived, intelligent, and powerful creature sitting on an enormously valuable resource, this is going to be a large boon for the future.</p>
    <p>You have one temporary stress box on your Economic track that will last until the end of the year, but that’s not really your main goal.</p>
    <p>Ankkh will now trade with you as an ally with an established trade agreement, making future trade checks easier. In addition, due to how much he enjoyed talking to Prosalirus, your next Trade check with Ankkh will have a boost die.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> To the benefit of poor Terry's blood pressure, things stay calm. Despite word of security breaches in other elves' territory, the river elf policy of keeping their exact locations and routes secret is working. They slip into winter quarters safe once again. Hell, Terry is even finally feeling confident he's not secretly afflicted.</p>
    <p>Of course, the Eyes do not take this passively. Rulyrana and Terry spend time planning the future of their security. With multiple breaches of security reported among allied elves, it's doubtless that the wolf elves know at least Partager's schedule. Arpenter has not been revealed to any outsiders save Ankkh, so it is probably safer.</p>
    <p>Given that the wolf elves have repeatedly tried to breach river elf security while they are in a publicly known position, both Eyes agree that they need to step up security while Partager is docked at allied settlements, particularly their upcoming visit to the fire elves as they have reported more wolf elf activities than anyone else.</p>
    <p>There's rough waters ahead, but your Eyes are open. Nowhere to go but downstream. Time to strap in.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> On the edge between the badlands and the Maar, most of the terrain indicated has no signs of hippos along the rivers. It doesn’t appear that they went anywhere along that branch of the Marraine. Somewhat disappointed by this, and somewhat reluctant to stray too far into the badlands when there’s reports of wolf elves in the area, the pathfinders stick close to the flotilla for the most part.</p>
    <p>This turns into a pretty good idea. Apparently the weather this fall is unpredictable. Several large dust storms kick up in the area. It’s highly unpleasant for the river elves, so they are unable to scout anything past the river’s edge for most of the season.</p>
    <p>Still, when they reach the fork in the river, they get a lucky break. The dust storms ease off for a few days, and the pathfinders actually find signs that hippos have passed through the area! They spread out and scout the territory in great detail, and end up finding a good amount of evidence.</p>
    <p>It appears that the hippo herd was moving further east, and it appears to be the same group that the pathfinders found signs of further down the Marraine.</p>
    <p>Wherever they may be found, it is almost certainly east of here somewhere.</p>
    <p>Somewhat disconcertingly, they also find an abandoned camp that appears to have once been used by the afflicted hoard that the river elves defeated. Thankfully, it is long abandoned and there are no stragglers.</p>
    <p>Arpenter struggles to make its way back down the Marraine as the season goes on. The dust storms worsen with time, to the point that it's hard to even see the sun most days. The flotilla sticks to the river, with elves spending as much time possible underwater or in rafts. The dust gets so thick that they have to shovel it off the decks daily to keep rafts from sinking under the weight. They are able to keep things moving, but only just.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, they are faced with a decision. On the edge of the river, battered by storms, they spot a ragged fire elf camp. They know that Arpenter is a secret, but well… those are cousins. They might need help.</p>
    <p>Prosalirus makes contact with the camp, and to his surprise finds it packed with both fire and winged elves, led by Dhakamari and a fire elf known as Vita. They are in a rough spot, having been trapped by the storms for weeks.</p>
    <p>Arpenter is a secret, but not so much that it's worth leaving elven heroes to die over. Prosalirus offers them passage out of the storms. Thankfully, they decline. The beleaguered group requests whatever supplies the flotilla can spare, but is determined to complete their objectives. Arpenter has food and supplies aplenty, so they give what they can. Prosalirus wishes them luck, then heads towards home.</p>
    <p>The good news is the other elves stayed in their camp. They figured out that Prosalirus was with an actual flotilla, but he carefully never names which flotilla. In addition, none of them set foot on Arpenter. The group may suspect a new flotilla, but they have no information on it.</p>
    <p>It's a bit of a breach yes, but family is family. It was worth it.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Unfortunately, with only the most vague information on the maps on terrain, and only a few scattered hints from the pathfinders leave Smilisca and Staurois with little to no concrete information. The best they can work out is that it’s somewhere south of the mountains, north of the scrublands, and east of the badlands. That… is not a narrow search area. The most absolutely frustrating part is that with the news from Arpenter that the herd moved east along the Marraine, by far the best candidate for a hippo habitat you’ve found so far is the mangrove swamp that Winter Quarters itself is in, yet for some reason there’s no sign of them. They both silently hope there’s not a quiet hippo grave somewhere in the 300 miles or so of river between the fork in the Marraine and Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p>Despite the frustration, Smilisca and Staurois mend their argument from earlier with a little bit of combined worry. The little gifts of food and drink they get during the long nights of study help. Huh. A lot of gifts, actually, and a lot of quiet attention.</p>
    <p>As it turns out, word about the signs of hippo has spread quietly among the flotillas. As they gather at Winter Quarters, a large number of hopeful river elves gather at the newly founded DWF. They share stories of their own hippos, their own losses, and their own families from back home. It doesn’t take long to realize that this is a resource.</p>
    <p>Hope is not lost, far from it. If river elves can make it this far, so can hippos. Smilisca and Staurois find plenty of willing volunteers in this group of wellwishers, and recruit them into the project. The DWF grows immensely, gaining some of the extremely experienced hippo riders, breeders, and trainers that have been milling around the flotillas for years feeling lost and rudderless. They combine their information in ways never seen before.</p>
    <p>While they don’t get a comprehensive plan for discovering the hippos, Smilisca and Staurois do get a comprehensive plan for what to do when they do find them, and they will  find them. They have to.</p>
    <p>The <i>Department of Wildlife and Fisheries</i> Aspect has been upgraded to <i>Department of Wildlife and Fisheries: Domestication Division</i>. This Aspect may be invoked again, particularly in matters regarding domesticating strange animals.</p>
    <p>In addition, the large numbers of volunteers and amazing amount of cultural knowledge and experience the Department represents will permanently reduce the difficulty of any checks involving training hippos (including training units!) by one.</p>
    <p><b>Other:</b> This is not the only surprising good news to happen this season.</p>
    <p>As winter falls, a ragged gaggle of hand pulled rafts pulls into Winter Quarters. It is packed with dozens of river elf refugees. They report that they heard the beacon calling to them, and then put everything they had into making it to the source. If not for knowing that the beacon represented safety, they might not have made it.</p>
    <p>There are many joyous reunions as these river elves find lost family among the flotillas gathered at winter quarters. Among those reunited is one very small, but extremely important reunion:</p>
    <p>The improvised oarmaster of this small flotilla is none other than Physalaemus. Eina’s lost river bond has returned.</p>
    <p>You have the River Refugees Aspect. This temporary Aspect does not expire with time, but can be Invoked once to grow a flotilla or create a new one.</p>
    <p><b>Misc:</b> As the flotilla makes its way down the goldfall, a letter is delivered to Partager by a winged elf who is, somewhat shockingly, wearing a uniform. The letter informs your leaders that the winged elves have turned their informal system of messengers into an actual formal post system, with set postage fees, schedules, delivery timeframes, postage codes, and stamps. Ooh, stamps! The letter gives you all the information you need to set up a post office in one of your settlements, allowing the regular transport of post and parcels between you and allied elven settlements.</p>
    <p>As the new office takes shape (assuming you permit it,) a basket labeled 'feather letters' appears on the counter. The messengers inform you that these are from residents of other cities to no one in particular, and that anyone can take one from the basket and answer it, and maybe strike up a friendship. 'Like a message in a bottle', they said. 'Seeing where it lands'.</p>
    <p>The Winged Elves have created a <i>Winged Mail</i> Civilization Aspect. Since this is just as helpful for allies to have access to as themselves, they have decided to give you access to this Aspect. You may Invoke it for anything involving long range trade or communication, same as if it were one of your own Aspects. Nice!</p>
    <p>On a more personal note, the winged elves request that you make a similar offer to the Crag and possibly the Cryptids when you see them. </p>
    <p id="i">Note: You don't have to do anything to be able to use this Aspect. The post office can be made by the Winged Post purchasing a small building for their own use. You do not have to create an Aspect for it.</p>
