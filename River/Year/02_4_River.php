    <p><b>Economic:</b> Smilisca and Staurois realize that assembling something to fit the needs of the dark elves for handling their refugee crisis at the Hilt’Inn is going to be more involved than it was to gather food for the crag elves.  It won’t be something they can finish in the same season that they’re supposed to be making the delivery.  Understanding this issue, Staurois asks Partager’s residents for help.</p>
	<p>Collecting the advice from the flotilla, assembling food, building materials, and tools to deliver to the Hilt’Inn is something Staurois does using the <i>Ventures</i> trapping of <b>Mercantilism</b>.  This rolls 2 Ability dice: <kbd>1 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> With Partager feeling vulnerable as their garrison heads out on the march late in the season, Staurois trusts that the Eyes in the Dark know that their number one duty is to spot anyone approaching the settlement before the flotilla is noticed.  They’re going to keep doing their <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> like their lives depend on it.  Because with just one Ability die, they kind of do: <kbd>1 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <h3 id="back">Roleplay Event 02.4: <a href="../Bonus/n_An Unexpected Arrival.php">An Unexpected Arrival</a></h3>
	<p><b>Military: </b> Returning from the meeting with Bryti, Litoria has a lot of work on her hands.  And the first step in digging herself out from under the heaping pile of tasks is to delegate.</p>
    <p>Step 1: Speak with Staurois, Eina, Smilisica, Prosalirus - it is important to let people know what the fight is for before taking the military on the march.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Get Smilisica to use that Feather thing to ask Ehra at Ft. Alfyr for any help he can send.  The blade elves have a strong military.  Surely they can provide assistance on the flanks.</p>
    <p>Step 3: Send a messenger to Winter Quarters so that they’re not taken by surprise if Operation Herd Dog fails.</p>
    <p>Step 4: Get the Angry Alligators to the ambush point.</p>
    <p>Step 5: Dig in, form battle lines.  Hide the Angry Alligators in the terrain.  Prepare to spring the trap.  And hey, there’s this refresh Fate point that’s not doing any good just waiting, so best use that to invoke the Angry Alligators’ Ambush Patience aspect.  Using the <i>Guerrilla Operations</i> trapping of <b>Special Operations</b>, this rolls 2 Ability and 2 Proficiency die: <kbd>2 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Step 6: Pray.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Eina is very thankful for her helpers.  Without them, she’d have been left hanging in the wind with Acris when the Hylidae cousins departed with the Angry Alligators.  Instead of bemoaning her lack of wizarding assistance for a portion of this season, Eina and her assistants take the opportunity to point the research in a different direction.  Instead of studying all the what ifs and technicalities of arcane theories, they look for similar spells that are divinely cast and try to suss out a way to scale them up.</p>
    <p>Acris is permitted to watch, but he does not have much time to do so while also handling the Hylidae Family raft, even with the help of one of the Eyes.  He is not permitted to touch anything at all.  Eina knows better than to let him try.</p>
	<p>This time, they’re using the <i>Research</i> trapping of <b>Spirituality</b> because that’s something they can do without a wizard present.  This rolls one Proficiency die: <kbd>0 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Staurois and Ny leave late in the season to make it to Surt on time for the yearly Potluck.  Two of the Eyes travel with them, a pair of recently reunited cousins, Teratohyla and Rulyrana Centrolenidae.  Teratohyla has recently traveled overland across a lot of the area they’re going to have to walk, and is a helpful guide for the journey toward Surt.  Traveling with little Natator is challenging, but with four adults they make it work.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b>Unfortunately, Staurois gets a bit of a distraction while trying to gather supplies for the trade with the dark elves. The unexpected military operation is a large drain on resources. Deployed soldiers need food, medical supplies, and support staff. Staurois finds himself wildly undermanned in trying to gather resources. He is unable to build up as comprehensive of an aid package as he had hoped to. Most of the extra food and medicinal herbs he had gathered together immediately go to the Angry Alligators and their operation, especially once it turns out that they take casualties.</p>
    <p>It’s not a total loss, however. Though they aren’t able to get food or relief supplies, Staurois does manage to use the construction rafts to gather a decent amount of timber on the way, and Litoria at least doesn’t run away with that.</p>
    <p>Though you were not able to get a Relief Package aspect, you were at the very least able to gather a Lumber Shipment, though this will be less useful to the dark elves.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> It is a quiet season for the Eyes. Thanks to Bryti and the courageous efforts of the Angry Alligators, Winter Quarters is safe and still a secret. A few Afflicted who had broken off from the horde do find their way east into the swamp, but well… The Eyes make sure they don't find their way out.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> Litoria deploys the Angry Alligators immediately upon getting word of the Afflicted horde from Bryti. She has only the werewolf's word that she will uphold her end of the plan and drive the monsters into the trap. It will be hard enough to set up the ambush on such short notice. All Litoria can do is decide to trust her, and tell her soldiers that she has confidence in this Lycan. Oddly enough, she finds that she does so easily.</p>
    <p>The Angry Alligators are a bit rusty. The Crocodilians haven't done a full scale ambush since Skaplyndi (and that left bad memories,) and this is the first battle most of the Archerfish have ever participated in. It's something of a mess getting everything moving. They do not move with the well oiled efficiency that they did during the war. Despite this, Litoria's quiet determination and the skill of the Croc veterans carry them through. They reach the ambush point only a day or two after their projected arrival, and the Angry Alligators deploy themselves into a textbook ambush just as they were trained to. After that, it's a waiting game.</p>
    <p>The wolf is good for her word.</p>
    <p>With an illusion of her as a towering monster, she scares the afflicted into your trap. The humans form up behind the hobgoblins with their backs to the river and shift into hybrid form to fight the terrifying monster before them.</p>
    <p>Bryti howls to signal the attack. It is a bizarre feeling for Litoria and all the veterans to hear the howl of a bloodline werewolf and understand that it is on their side. The afflicted are shaken with fear, and the river elves use this as an opening for their attack.</p>
    <p>In the initial assault, the Crocodilians manage to entirely destroy a unit of afflicted humans, then takes the time to slaughter any survivors. Shocked by the sudden violence, the remaining afflicted target the Crocodilians. Without silver, the Archerfish's arrows do little.</p>
    <p>The Archerfish switch to their gigging sticks and do their best to keep the pressure off the Crocs. The Archerfish acquit themselves well despite not having silver weapons, but the Crocs are forced to do most of the heavy fighting.</p>
    <p>As the fighting descends into brutal close quarters, the afflicted fight back with terrible strength and ferocity. Both the Archerfish and the Crocs take casualties early. Still, they press on in what becomes a brutal slog.</p>
    <p>After getting surrounded and whittled down by the Archerfish, the last unit of human afflicted break and attempt to flee. Bryti intercepts them with another illusion, driving them back to the river to be slaughtered. She joins the battle to ensure the grim work gets done.</p>
    <p>The Crocs and Archerfish surround the remaining hobgoblins and assault them. The ferocious warriors do not go down easily. Smilisca is forced to use a fog spell to cover the vulnerable Archerfish as they take more casualties.</p>
    <p>The Crocs make the last push to overwhelm the remaining hobgoblin afflicted. They fight to the last, never breaking. Litoria finds the brutish leader and kills him. After that, it's mop up.</p>
    <p>Both the Archerfish and Crocodilians have Light Casualties. This condition will disappear after one full season of resting in garrison.</p>
    <p>The Crocodilians briefly took Heavy Casualties, but immediate on site triage from their medics as well as Bryti's assistance in preventing the spread of the affliction converted this to Light Casualties.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> With a little more experience in ritual magic, Eina has a better idea of what she’s dealing with this time. Water and magic don’t normally mix, but one of Calestros’ domains is water. The river augury spell proves that with their cultural and spiritual connection to rivers, the river elves should be able to use rivers as part of their ritual spells. The trick, of course, is not to use the water itself as part of the magic. Rather, by using the concept of a river and the construct of what water means to river elves as part of the spell, this should allow it to work without having to brute force your way around all that magic-dampening water. Indeed, even if the spell is largely arcane this should work. It’s a matter of what it means to the elves casting it rather than what it means to any deity.</p>
    <p>With that, Eina gets a much better idea of what she’s dealing with. How difficult the ritual will be to develop will depend on how powerful she wants it to be. She believes she has an idea how to transmit a message through the water and to the skin of any river elves connected to it. The questions are “How much information do we want to send?” and “How much river can we sent it through?”</p>
    <p>The most basic version you could develop would be a version that travels on only one river and gives only the most basic information to the recipient, little more than a direction and a sense of being welcome. That version would be difficulty one to develop, and also be relatively easy to perform. However, it might not provide much in the way of direct benefit.</p>
    <p>You can decide whether to make the spell give more detailed information, or transmit over multiple rivers. More detailed information would give river elves receiving the ritual an idea of who is contacting them, how to get to a specific location, and more detailed information about the river in between. This would make it much easier for river elves contacted to reach the beacon. This would increase the difficulty of developing the ritual by one.</p>
    <p>You can also decide to improve the range to “One river and all rivers that feed into or out of that river.” This would increase the difficulty by one. You could also modify it to “Up to three rivers and all rivers that feed into those that are connected by a body of water to the territory the ritual was cast in.” This would allow you to cast the ritual over a massive amount of territory, but in turn require a massive amount of raw magical energy to perform. It would increase the difficulty of developing the ritual by 2, and likely make it harder to cast.</p>
    <p>How you choose to develop the ritual is up to you (and as always further development may be used to apply these modifications after the ritual is developed,) but either way you receive an upgrade on checks to develop this ritual that will last until you successfully create it. </p>
	<p><b>Congratulations!</b> You have survived another year in this strange and chaotic land! As a reward for your perseverance, you receive one skill point to distribute as you wish!</p>
