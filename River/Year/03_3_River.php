    <p><b>Economic:</b> Gosh, there sure are a lot of refugees around here lately.  Partager is feeling a little crowded and nobody really <i>wants</i> to spend their summer stuck in the Winter Quarters.  River elves only rest when they’re dead, of course.  It’s time to grow, to spread, and to build a second flotilla.</p>
    <p>Partager is uniquely capable with construction projects.  Over the coldest parts of winter, the elves of the existing flotilla work tirelessly to aid their cousins in assembling the sleekest, most elegant, and fastest rafts they have ever built.  The new brightwood forestry techniques inspire the craftselves to explore new possibilities in their trade.</p>
    <p>Giving the very prepared refugees homes of their own invokes the Well Equipped Refugees aspect, and making the rafts out of the sustainably-farmed Brightwood invokes the Brightwood Grove - Sustainable Forestry aspect for effect.  Because Partager is outfitted with Construction Rafts, the flotilla’s assistance adds one advantage automatically.  There’s talk among those setting out with the new flotilla of naming it Arpenter, to survey.  Using the <i>Establishment</i> trapping of <b>Infrastructure</b> rolls: 2 Ability and 2 Proficiency dice: <kbd>2 advantage, 4 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd></p>
    <p>Partager’s staying in Winter Quarters.  It is tradition.  But that doesn’t mean the flotilla is actually whiling away the winter sitting on their hands.</p>
    <p>With an extra Fate point on hand, Litoria opts to motivate the Economic track to be able to also commission some silversheen weapons for the Brave Beavers.  They invoke the <i>Silver Shipment</i> aspect to do this.

    <p><b>Political:</b> Rulyrana and Teratohyla agree.  The best thing to do with a political action is to cloak and dagger it up.  Staurois trusts the Eyes to see the job done without his supervision anymore.  They’re really doing a great job so far on this build a spy organization from scratch thing.  The <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> rolls 2 Ability dice: <kbd>0 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd></p>
	<p><b>Military: </b>Nobody wants to leave any settlement without their own defenders.  Least of all the refugees who are planning to live in the new one.  Smilisca takes the new volunteers over to Fort Alfyr to train into a new division of Archerfish.  If maybe, the Navigator has other reasons to want to spend a large portion of his winter season within the stone walls of the fort, it goes unremarked by his cousin. </p>
    <p>This uses the <i>Drill</i> trapping of <b>Military Science</b> and rolls: 3 Ability, 1 Proficiency, and 1 Bonus die: <kbd>3 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd></p>
    <p>The new division picks the name, Crafty Crawfish.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> During the full moon closest to midwinter, Eina, Smilisca, Acris, and anyone who wants to watch take a trip to the river on the southern edge of Winter Quarters.  It’s not far to travel, so there’s a bit of a crowd.  Once there, Eina pauses to bless and name the river, calling it Marraine.  It’s the godmother river, the one closest to their safest place to stay.</p>
    <p>It’s a cold, and miserable day.  Rain falls at a constant, slow rate, obscuring the sky.  Smilisca provides light spells to be able to see the apparatus he and Eina have to construct under the slowly flowing water.  Little pots of incense float above them, marking their place under the dark water.  The rain hisses off the hot braziers.</p>
    <p>Under the waves, the two most proficient magical experts begin their task.  They assemble a tiny dam, using rocks brought downstream from the Hilt’Inn, to protect their project from the current.  Once the little dam is complete, they put together the ritual spell’s components themselves.  Wood, of a variety that sinks rather than floats, builds a miniature version of the New Year bonfires.  In the hollow portion of the mock-bonfire, they place items that feel, in the water, like comfort and home.  Whole spices, herbs, wolfsbane, and chips of wood from the bottom of a raft fill the little fire.</p>
    <p>With the tiny beacon constructed, Eina twines precious copper wire around its sticks.  The little binding keeps it in place and prevents it from being toppled easily.  The fresh copper wire also shines like burning flames.</p>
    <p>They step back from the work of building the spell’s anchor.  With a nod, Smilisca kills the spell lights.  In the dim grey world of the cold, rainy night, the river is quiet.  Eina’s fellow clergy hum a quiet tune, and she follows its cadence with her prayer.</p>
    <p id="i">“Come home.  Come find your home here with us.  Come home.  Calestros, please send them home to us.”</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> <i>Infrastructure</i> - Congratulations! You have successfully founded the settlement of <b><i>Arpenter!</i></b> It has the following stats:</p>
    <h3>Arpenter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Settlement Aspects:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Brightwood Nomads:</i> This flotilla has been created with lightweight, fast moving rafts made of Brightwood. When moving through water, this flotilla moves with a +10 Bonus to its speed- so 30 when traveling upstream, 50 when traveling downstream, and 20 when moving along a coastline. The lighter weight boats do make travelling overland easier, providing a move speed of 15. While fast, Brightwood is fragile and this flotilla is more vulnerable to Events that might cause damage to the flotilla, upgrading the difficulty made to withstand such tragedies once.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Size:</b> Village</li>
        <li><b>Garrison:</b> Currently (soon to be) full with the Crafty Crawfish</li>
        <li><b>Location:</b> (-2,3)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The usage of Brightwood for an entire flotilla turns out to be a major success. The extra buoyancy means the rafts can still carry a large amount of cargo and move swiftly. The extra weight of living spaces and cargo means that the rafts don’t consistently get the extra speed that an actual boat gets from being made of bright, but the slight boost to their speed definitely adds up over a long journey. Better yet, their light weight makes them considerably easier to haul upstream against a current.</p>
    <p>As winter draws to a close, the elves who will make Arpenter their home are proud. These new rafts are the pride of the river elves, they are marvels of engineering and a true demonstration of the craftsmanship that river elves are capable of. The craftsevles that make them can’t help but show off a bit, incorporating beautiful scrollwork and decorations on the rafts themselves. They are eager to begin their journey, and maybe a little excited to show off to the other elves.</p>
    <p><i>Accessorizing</i> - The lessons of the Wolf’s Battle, as it’s coming to be called, were hard felt. Even though another horde of afflicted doesn’t seem likely at the moment, the world is in too much chaos to forget the hard-learned lessons of the rebellion. The agony that the Archerfish felt while trying to fight lycanthropes without silver weapons is still too recent. </p>
    <p>With that pain in mind, and with the larger more permanent structures of Winter Quarters allowing more time, your smiths trade for blade elf steel and begin crafting weapons from not just silver, but silversheen.</p>
    <p>By tweaking the alloy a bit with formulas from the darkest days of the war, the smiths are able to utilize the silver shipment to its fullest extent. By making sure the silver is used with utmost efficiency, they are able to create more weapons than expected.</p>
    <p>Not only are they able to equip the new unit of Archerfish with silversheen weapons and arrows, they are able to equip the original unit of Archerfish with the same kind of weapons. Note that silversheen weapons automatically count as mastercraft as well!</p>
    <p>These new weapons are a good confidence booster for the Angry Alligators Archerfish. This unit, having survived a brutal battle where the odds were not on their side, has trained enough that they now have the Experienced I Condition.</p>
    <p>(Note- Since battles are going to be necessarily infrequent, I’m going to hand out that condition after a fresh unit has survived their first battle much of the time.)</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> It seems all the craziness elsewhere means that prying eyes are off the river elves for now. Thankfully, Bryti seems to have covered her trail as well. No wolf riders are seen in the swamps surrounding Winter Quarters. The location remains safe, at least for now. This time, there are no running rooftop battles while training is going on at Alfyr either. Pretty quiet, so far.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> River elves are quickly becoming a welcome sight at Fort Alfyr. With the recent demonstration of the skills of the Archerfish at the Battle of the Wolf, it’s quite easy to find able volunteers. In fact, the river elves are able to handle most of the training themselves. The blade elves mostly supply the facilities, personnel, and supplies needed to make the training go smoothly and efficiently. </p>
    <p>The facilities and equipment are a big help, as are the war scholars. They eagerly take notes from the unique mixed combat unit type that is the Archerfish. They note its extreme tactical flexibility, and are quite happy to add information about their fighting style to the lexicon of elven battle.</p>
    <p>You have successfully created the Crafty Crawfish division, with one unit of Archerfish.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> There is silence for several moments once Eina’s prayer has completed. The incense burns quietly for several minutes. Unsure if the spell is complete, Eina and her clergy continue to pray. Slowly, a warm light becomes visible under the surface of the water. Flickering and yellow, the beacon appears to be a tiny bonfire. It grows in brightness until it is clearly visible from the surface, with water slowly flowing around it in a circle. The beacon is stable.</p>
    <p>Once it is complete, Eina feels something. Warmth on her skin, the smell of spices and a campfire, and a distant sense of comfort. Every river elf touching the water reports something different. Some taste their favorite spice, some hear distant songs, some hear the quiet cadence of a paddle, the whisper of a prayer, the feel of a hippo’s skin  under their fingers. Every river elf who perceives the beacon feel something different, but they all feel something that reminds them of home, and everyone feels a sense of direction that guides them to the beacon. Even scouts much further down river report the feeling.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, Bryti was watching the ritual. She reports both being unable to see the glow of the beacon and being unable to feel anything when touching the water. The ritual, then, is a success. Only river elves can perceive it, and it gives them a sense of belonging, coming home, and a direction to the beacon. It stays strong for weeks, showing no sign of stopping. The beacon is strong and will stay lit for 4 turns, extinguishing at the end of Turn 15, year 4 spring.</p>
    <p>The only downside is that Eina made a few miscalculations in the construction of the beacon itself. She did not realize exactly how much material is needed to keep it “fueled,” mostly in the form of rare incense and material components. These can be replaced from the swamp, but it is slow going and she is barely able to find enough to keep the beacon lit. Any other magic related checks (research or ritual) made while the beacon is active will have a setback die unless you can find a new supply of ritual materials.</p>
    <p>Late in the season, a feathernet message requests military assistance in Riverhaven.  Litoria knows exactly what to do.</p>
