    <p><b>Economic:</b> Back at Winter Quarters, the Eels and the small group of elves keeping the overwintering place safe and well maintained hatch a plan to put their resources to better use.  They investigate the seeds and life cycle of the Brightwood mangroves, and start working out a schedule for how to grow the trees to have a sustainable harvest schedule.</p>
    <p>They put to use the <i>Investment</i> trapping of <b>Infrastructure</b> to work toward sustainable forestry, adding an improvement to the terrain aspects for this location.  This rolls 2 Ability and 1 Proficiency dice: <kbd>3 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs.</kbd></p>
    <p>When Staurois shows up with Partager, he looks over their work and shakes his head sadly.  They really should have had a druid on the team when starting this endeavor, but he does agree that it needs to be done.  Spending a Fate point, they try again: <kbd>0 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs.</kbd></p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> The mission to rescue Shadimon was supposed to serve as a trial run for the two Eyes in the Dark sent on it.  The one who proved to be most successful was supposed to be Assigned as the Dominant Eye for the fledgling spy organization.  This, unfortunately, did not go as expected.  Both Eyes successfully accomplished their mission.  While the Right Eye technically secured the prisoner’s escape, the Left Eye arguably prevented the death of a valuable asset and managed to evade any detection until he chose to reveal himself.</p>
    <p>No Dominant Eye was Assigned as a result of this overly successful rescue mission.  As such, both Eyes continue to work together as equals.  And as equals, they continue to look for spies among the flotilla.  This uses the <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b>, rolling 2 Ability dice: <kbd>0 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs.</kbd></p>
    <p><b>Military: </b>With Light Casualties, the Angry Alligators stay put in their moving garrison with Partager.  Though tempted to try and follow the tracks of the wolf riders, they instead park their butts in their kayaks and take this time to recover from the damage the Afflicted inflicted upon them.</p>
    <p>The pathfinders, however, are not bound by such restraints.  With Partager returning to Winter Quarters from the South, they scout out the swamp directly South and Southwest of Winter Quarters.  They do not want surprises coming from that direction while the river elves are gathered together at their secure home.  This uses the <i>Pathfinders</i> trapping of <b>Reconnaissance</b>, rolling 2 Ability dice: <kbd>0 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs.</kbd></p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> With both Eina and Smilisca back together and available to work on the project again, the team renews their efforts to complete the research and development step of crafting the perfectly castable River Beacon spell.  This uses the <i>Magic</i> trapping of <b>Spirituality</b> to craft a mostly-divine spell, and rolls 1 Proficiency die: <kbd>0 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Partager returns to Winter Quarters with additional refugees in tow.  They haven’t yet built up the resources needed to set sail a new flotilla, but everyone acknowledges that it will most definitely be something that can be accomplished this year.  There is a lot of excitement surrounding this decision, and many debates are held to start the process of determining an appropriate name.  But one has not yet been chosen.  There are other choices that are more pressing.</p>
    <p>At the end of the season and a long discussion about how to handle it, Staurois finally convinces the other three influential river elves that they should host next year’s potluck at Oarsman’s Rest.  Having made the decision to host, Eina agrees - all Elves should be welcomed to come and add the names they need to the wall of the remembered at rest.  And she privately determines that this does mean all elves.</p>
    <p>Eina has been granted access to many spells through her long devotion to Calestros.  One of them is the same spell that powers the Feathers.  She uses that Sending to contact Breaker.  In acknowledgement of her sacrifices that have benefited the allied Elves, Eina hopes the erstwhile Coyote will accept this inclusion as an Elf.</p>
    <p>"Heard 'bout whatchu did. It's been a rough year fer us all.  Celebrate replacing it with a better one. Start of Summer, Oarsman's Rest."</p>
    <p>The spell is one that grants a response from the person who receives the message.  Breaker responds, in an oddly calm voice: "Gracias. I'll be there, if I'm alive."</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Congratulations! You have improved the Brightwood Grove Terrain aspect to Brightwood Grove - Sustainable Forestry!</p>
    <p>In the end, this turns out to be the last gift from your old friend Skati Holt Vinr. The werebeaver was a fan of industry and production, but still maintained that Lycan love of forests and wild places. While initially attempts to set up the Brightwood for safe utilization were time consuming, Starois arrives with a plan.</p>
    <p>Lycans had long ago developed methods for harvesting lumber while still maintaining a forest sustainably. In fact, that methodology is how Vinr’s family rose to prominence in the first place. Holt himself knew a great deal of these Lycan forestry secrets, and they revolve around druids and the careful stewardship of wild places.</p>
    <p>Starouis being a druid himself, Holt had shared many of these secret practices. Holt had trusted the river elves, and had hoped that they would eventually adopt these methods themselves. He was right, of course, but not in the way he thought he would be.</p>
    <p>With these forestry methods given to him by the Lycans, Starouis organizes a handful of druids into working through these methods. The Brightwood grove begins to thrive, becoming an even more beautiful place while also having the resiliency to have a large amount of its trees harvested without causing damage.</p>
    <p>You can now harvest Brightwood without fear of damaging its delicate ecosystem. It will be years before the Lycan forestry methods are fully implemented, but for now it can handle anything you need it to.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Teratohyla and Rulyrana, despite their rivalry, end up dividing up their work carefully. After all, there are many ways a spy could attempt to compromise Winter Quarters. Terry focuses on the settlement itself, using his social skills and stealthy observation to keep watch for anyone who shouldn’t be there or is asking the wrong questions.</p>
    <p>While Terry and his Eyes focus on the social aspect, Rulyrana and her Eyes stay in the water. They carefully and stealthily keep watch from the water on all possible ways someone could sneak their way into winter quarters. Like ambush predators, they wait in the water to pounce on anyone foolish enough to think they could sneak up on the river elves.</p>
    <p>Thankfully no one does. The location of Winter Quarters is still a secret, and will remain so at the end  of this season. No afflicted or wolf riders attempt to penetrate the swamp. This, of course, brings up questions of what, exactly, the wolf riders are up to now...</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> Your pathfinders complete their assessment of the terrain around Winter Quarters. As you had hoped, all of the land squares surrounding Winter Quarters are packed with dense, difficult to traverse swampland. This swampland is a natural defensive barrier, providing both physical protection and concealment from prying outside eyes.</p>
    <p>The river elves know enough about swampland warfare that they can easily take advantage of the carefully mapped swamplands. Things that are major thoroughfares for them are difficult to traverse or even spot for outsiders. Large armed forces will have difficulty moving through this terrain, and may even get lost. Not to mention the careful planning of the Eyes and river elves’ natural bonuses to both finding enemies and not being spotted themselves in such terrain.</p>
    <p>Now that you have scouted and mapped all of the terrain adjacent to Winter Quarters, this Dense Swampland is a terrain aspect that can be Invoked in the defense of Winter quarters. It can be invoked both to conceal the location of and to physically protect Winter Quarters. This bonus will count if an enemy moves through any of these swamp territories, thus providing excellent protection from land attacks.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Congratulations! You have developed the ritual River Beacon I</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Risk -</b> Low</li>
        <li><b>Target -</b> One River</li>
        <li><b>Difficulty -</b> 1</li>
        <li><b>Effect -</b> This ritual will send out a beacon that is only perceptible to river elves. This beacon is perceptible to any river elves currently in contact with that river, all the way to its source. Any river elf who perceives the beacon gets a direction and a sense of welcome and belonging, and a sense that it’s other river elves sending the beacon. When created, this beacon will last for 1d4 turns. The DM will roll a percentile die in secret every turn to see if any river elves perceive the beacon and decide to follow it. If successful, this will provide a New Arrivals Aspect the next turn that can be Invoked to grow existing settlements or create a new one. With the beacon being in its most basic form, the percentage chance of this is currently fairly low. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eina and Smilisca are finally successful in creating the Beacon ritual. With the two of them cooperating again, it’s finally enough to create the spell. It’s still fairly basic as far as rituals go, but it still has great potential. Communicating over hundreds of miles is no small feat, even if it’s only basic information.</p>
    <p><b>Extra:</b> Gifts arrive for Rulyrana, Teratohyla, and Eina. They are from Shadimon, who wishes to express his deep gratitude to everyone who participated in his rescue.</p>
    <p>Eina receives a very beautifully crafted holy symbol of Calestros made of copper. It is enchanted to be able to cast light like an everburning torch on command.</p>
    <p>Rulyrana and Teratohyla each receive a small copper fish enchanted in the same manner, as well as a Concealing Pocket.</p>
    <p>In addition, all three receive one of Shadimon's feathers as a personal thanks.</p>
    <p><b>War Games:</b> Unfortunately, no one is able to spare enough soldiers for there to be true war games this season. Still, nearly everyone was able to send at least a handful of elites.</p>
    <p>Breaker and a few of her Cazadores are able to demonstrate what they're capable of in open cavalry combat. Litoria and a few of the Crocodilians who aren't still recovering from their losses demonstrate some of their river ambush tactics. Dark elves demonstrate some of their close quarters fighting in the fort. Dreamdust elves give primers on night fighting and desert tactics. The fire elves are able to demonstrate shield walls and a phalanx. Shadimon isn't able to fly, but Shrike is able to demonstrate the aerial tactics they have developed with the blade elves. The blade elves show off the offensive and defensive capabilities of the swordelves. Even the mighty and terrifying Echo, made even more terrifying by horrible burn scars now covering nearly half his body, shows up with a few of his Euclast warriors and show off their brutal front line slugging potential.</p>
    <p>All in all, while it is not exactly what was planned, seeing the best of the best show off what they can do is good for morale. The morale boost will provide all who participated with a boost die on the Drill trapping of Military Science next season.</p>
