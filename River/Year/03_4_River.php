    <p>It’s Spring again, and with the thaw comes the faster current off the mountains.  To avoid that dangerous current, Arpenter and Partager embark on their separate journeys as soon as possible.  Partager sets out on the Goldwater, traveling through Ft. Alfyr.  Arpenter, however, sets their rudders into the Marraine.  It’s time someone investigated the waterway that flows directly into Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p>With the separating of the flotillas comes a moment of great decisions for Hylodes family.  Asper and Caete have to decide which flotilla to travel with this year.  For Caete, the choice is easy.  The home raft’s crane makes it impossible for it to keep up with the swift lightweight craft that make up the new Arpenter flotilla.  For Asper, there are more options available.</p>
    <p>Though in the past they’d agreed that theirs would be a river bond, Asper can’t actually bring himself to follow through with it and leave.  Something about their near death experience so early in their marriage has delivered a certain amount of paranoia to the fisherelf.  He is afraid that if there should be another flood he would have missed out on time that could have been spent together.  Time is precious, even for elves who have so very much of it available.</p>
    <p>Asper stays with Partager for a third year.</p>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Staurois recognizes the risks of having a large population concentrated in one location.  There are many, and it has been a long while since they were a populous enough people to incur them.  But with two flotilla now converging on Winter Quarters every year, those risks to its ecosystem are quite dangerous.</p>
    <p>Staurois consults his subject matter experts, fisherelves, hunters, herbalists, and farmers, gleaning all he can from their expertise.  He takes their suggestions, and pools the data.  This may take some time.  But the end goal is to arrange appropriate harvest schedules for marsh wildlife and resources.  Using the <i>Investment</i> trapping of <b>Infrastructure</b> to found a department of wildlife and fisheries in Winter Quarters.  This rolls 2 Ability and 1 Proficiency die: <kbd>1 advantage, 1 success, 0 triumphs</kbd></p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> There are Eyes everywhere.  And they are on high alert for enemy spies.  Yep.  <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> again.  This rolls 2 Ability dice: <kbd>0 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd></p>
    <p><b>Military: </b>The Angry Alligators deploy from Ft. Alfyr, with Litoria riding Sauver at their lead.  Rulyrana, the Right Eye in the Dark, tags along.  The Eye has critical information about the shoreline around the Coldwater fort.  They pick up some extra kayaks and transport the blade elf Alpha Division with them.</p>
    <p>Rulyrana’s critical information will be put to good use.  The Angry Alligators bypass Riverhaven accidentally, since it does not, in fact, sit on a river.  With a shrug and a look at the assembled military might piggybacking on their kayaks, they continue onward to Coldwater.  Litoria puts an eye on the plans devised by the Terror, and determines that this battlefield plays more to her army’s weaknesses than its strengths.  She settles on a diversionary tactic instead.</p>
    <p>Outside Coldwater, they deposit their allies onshore before heading into the lake, quietly, stealthily, and begin the siege of the city.  Some enterprising elves point out important support structures in the fort that are accessible from the water.  That looks like a surprising oversight that the Lycan engineers should have definitely considered when they built the fort originally.</p>
    <p>It’s time for a Stunt Use!  <i>It Just Fell Over We Swear</i> - River elves, being crafty sorts, all have at least a little experience in construction.  Their military is no exception.  They perform the Raze military action on the fort at Coldwater, carefully damaging critical supports to topple critical walls in directions that will not fall on any civilian structures.  The goal is to dismantle the fort, not squish the people who live around it.</p>
    <p>There’s quite a lot in their favor for this effort - <i>Old Fort Remade</i> gets invoked because river elves are intimately familiar with the architecture of Lycan forts.  They’ve built a few, knocked over a few.  You know how it is.  Once you’ve collapsed one fort you’ve seen them all.  <i>Lakeside Docks</i> gets invoked because it’s an easy access point for the river elf military to use to get inside the town’s defenses.  Rulyrana even knows a handy route into the fort itself if they really need it.</p>
    <p>Using their stunt to <i>Raze</i> using the <b>Infrastructure</b> skill, the river elves roll 2 Ability, and 3 Proficiency dice: <kbd>2 advantage 6 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd></p>
    <p>With this task complete, Litoria uses the last Fate point of the year to compel the Coyote aspect, <i>Held together by spit, barbed wire, and blood</i>, to suggest that the civilian population of Coldwater sees the fort’s collapse as a symbol for their total loss of faith in Coyote’s leadership.  She hopes that they chose to evacuate for safer locations.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Smilisca sees what Staurois is up to, and offers his aid.  They make use of the <i>Research</i> trapping of <b>Academics</b> to organize fish reproduction habit data, migration path charts, and the totals of how much food is needed to keep the winter population fed and healthy.  This rolls all of one shiny Ability die: <kbd>0 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd></p>
    </p>Meanwhile, Allophryne and Blinkin follow Bryti to the Observatory.  Travelling alone, they’re able to make better time than the whole flotilla on the move.  Allophryne even makes the first leg of the journey even shorter by showing Bryti how to manage a canoe.  When she heads out to cross the desert, he says a temporary goodbye to chunky old Blinkin, certain that he will see the old gator again when he returns in a few months.</p>
    <h3 id="back">Roleplay Event 3.4.2: <a href="../Bonus/11_A Scholarly Pursuit.php">A Scholarly Pursuit</a></h3>
    <p>When Partager arrives at Oarsman’s Rest, there is a flurry of activity as preparations for the yearly potluck begin.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> The bountiful natural resources around Winter Quarters are a vital natural resource, and they must be preserved. With population swelling dramatically every winter, it would be easy to accidentally overstress the local ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Staurois makes sure that won't happen. Much of what he accomplishes is in planning and managing these resources, but a significant amount of actual infrastructure is built. Sheltered nurseries for fish and wildlife, carefully managed canals and designated areas for flotillas to use that won't damage the flora and fauna, and careful mapping of erosion and drainage on the delicate coastline all come into play.</p>
    <p>The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has been established, allowing the locals to maintain the vibrant ecosystem with ease. The swamps around Winter Quarters should stay sustainable for many years to come.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Teratohyla has a hunch.</p>
    <p>The upcoming potluck is one of the extremely few times that it is publicly known both when and where a flotilla is going to be. If someone wanted to spy on the river elves, this would be a golden opportunity.</p>
    <p>Knowing he doesn't have Rulyrana's gifts of stealth, Terry takes a different approach. He focuses on the social side, deploying his Eyes among the people to quietly observe and watch for interlopers.</p>
    <p>While blending in with a group building preparations for the potluck, Terry notices something out of the ordinary - or rather, something too ordinary: A river elf whose name and face he can't quite place, but seems like they belong.</p>
    <p>Terry knows everyone. Something's not right. It doesn't take him long to realize someone is using magic to blend in with the river elves. Terry follows this suspiciously not suspicious individual for some time. He gathers a few other Eyes as backup. Near nightfall, the spy attempts to board the Hylidae family raft while Smilisca and Acris are present.</p>
    <p>With no other choice, Terry signals one of the other Eyes to go get help and confronts the spy himself.</p>
    <p>The spy responds with immediate violence, but Terry's unassuming appearance makes the spy briefly underestimate him. In the ensuing struggle, Terry and the spy both fall in the water. In the fighting, Terry and the spy both take several stab wounds. Terry is poisoned, but backup arrives.</p>
    <p>Seeing he is compromised, the spy flees. Terry is unable to pursue thanks to his injuries, but is able to note the spy didn't swim as well as an actual river elf.</p>
    <p>Terry was unable to identify or capture the spy, but he was able to stop the spy from finding out critical information about the river elves. He recovers from his injuries after a few days.</p>
    <p>The Eyes stay on high alert for the remainder of the season, but no further incursions are attempted.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> The Battle of Riverhaven was a stunning success and a decisive victory. Coyote will no longer threaten you or your allies.</p>
    <p>The combined force of dreamdust elves, Vaquero elves, fire elves, winged elves, and Machakw win a decisive victory in defense of the city against a larger enemy force. The Terror’s excellent defensive plan, as well as outstanding leadership by allied commanders, and a little bit of luck (and a lot of bagpipes) allowed for the victory.</p>
    <p>Winged elf scouts managed to report the size and location of Coyote’s forces well before the arrived - 1400 troops in total: 800 militia, 400 soldiers, and 200 Cazadores. The huge force was slowed down by the complex network of traps that the dreamdust elves had laid. Navigating the traps added hours of delay to their advance. With the advanced warning, the defenders had time to arrange their forces.</p>
    <p>Terror laid out her cavalry trap carefully, and set up the most elite units the elves had to defend the center. Vitally, the dreamdust elves prepared concealed positions on the flanks. The Machakw raider forces lay in wait, prepared to enclose the attacking Coyotes in a pincer maneuver.</p>
    <p>No plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this day was no different. Coyote had fought alongside Breaker for years, and knew her tactics and capabilities well. He was able to successfully guess that Terror would use Breaker as bait for a cavalry charge. He did not fall for the trap. When he began his attack, he feinted a charge for Breaker with one unit of Cazadores. After Breaker maneuvered away from the charge, the first unit abruptly changed course for the weakest part of the fire elf lines while Coyote and his Cazadores charged around the fire elf lines to take a shot at Breaker.</p>
    <p>It almost worked. By sheer luck, the route he chose for his surprise charge took his unit directly through the concealed position in which Hashkeh and his elite Machakw raiders lay in wait. Unable to see the position in time, Coyote’s Cazadores were well into the unit’s formation when Hashkeh sprung an attack. With weapons specifically designed to take riders off of horses, the Machakw tore into the Coyotes in a surprise close quarters assault.</p>
    <p>Further, the fire elf Chevaliers were able to intercept the second unit of Cazadores that was charging the Milites, who would have likely been destroyed in the attack. As the initial charge floundered and the front lines erupted in battle, the rest of the Coyote forces engaged the allied lines.</p>
    <p>Coyote’s Cazadores were quickly surrounded by fire and dreamdust elf units. Unable to bring the fury of a charge onto the surrounding infantry, Coyote attempted to punch through a gap between Machakw and dreamdust forces. Just as his forces were reaching open ground and about to pull back, Breaker intervened.</p>
    <p>She had seen Coyote’s unit get trapped and quickly maneuvered her Cazadores to exploit his position. As soon as Coyote had created an opening large enough, she threw all of her quite considerable wrath into a ferocious cavalry charge, with her in the lead.</p>
    <p>Breaker’s charge was one of the most astoundingly violent cavalry charges anyone on the field had ever witnessed. It was a hit so ruthless and so bloody even Lycan shock cavalry would blanch. Coyote’s Cazadores had already taken severe losses, and were unable to resist the fury of the charge. Breaker herself was the tip of the spear, tearing through the exhausted enemy until she found Coyote and killed him herself. Buenos Dias, Fuckboy.</p>
    <p>Coyote was taken off the field with such surprising speed that he was unable to relay orders to his troops to adapt to the suddenly changed battlefield. His elite forces marched on the center and attempted to divide the allied line while the massed militia maintained their squares on the flanks, staying in formation.</p>
    <p>The Coyote forces had no secondary leader. There was no one left who Coyote trusted enough to share the duties of command. Without leadership, the Coyote military kept following the initial plan. The Cazadores and soldiers kept fighting in the center, but were slowly overwhelmed by the elite fire elf and dreamdust elf forces. </p>
    <p>The winged elves engaged the archers ferociously. The frontline soldiers had been expecting volleys of arrows to keep their foes at bay, but with the constant attack runs of the Harriers and accurate long range fire of the SkyHawks, they were unable to support the main force.</p>
    <p>The Militia stayed in ranks on the sides. They were expecting an order to press the center once the elite forces made a foothold, but with Coyote dead that order never came. Most of the militia stayed in formation and did not directly engage in combat. A few units of Machakw and dreamdust elves were able to engage their front ranks and keep the bulk of the militia from being involved in the battle.</p>
    <p>With no support, the elite frontline soldiers slowly collapsed under attack from the superior numbers of allied frontline troops. As the survivors fled the battlefield, Coyote’s forces began to unravel. Machakw broke through the Coyote lines and engaged the archers, nearly tearing them apart, and the last unit of Cazadores turned to flee. Their elite forces were broken.</p>
    <p>With the army collapsing, Breaker again charged the remaining enemy Cazadores. They hit their former allies hard. A couple dozen survivors began to flee into the desert. Instead of pursuing, Breaker turned around and returned to the center of the battlefield. Standing on her horse and holding her new banner high, she called out for the remaining Coyote forces to surrender.</p>
    <p>With nowhere left to turn, they did so. While the bulk of the militia was still intact, they had no leadership and no remaining professional army to support. They were not loyal enough to Coyote’s cause to continue the attack, and indeed many of them still felt loyal to Breaker.</p>
    <p>The scattered surviving soldiers surrendered, but surprisingly the remaining Militia formally declared that they were defecting to Breaker’s Vaqueros.</p>
    <p>Riverhaven is still a mess. There are currently more soldiers than civilians in the city, and there  is plenty of post-battle chaos as the allied military decides what to do with surrendered enemy forces and where to go next. Learning that the siege of Coldwater is ongoing, Breaker is determined to gather her new militia and her Cazadores and go to Coldwater to take it for herself.</p>
    <p>As one of your allies. Of course.</p>
    <p>The Siege of Coldwater begins on a high note. The river elves successfully infiltrate the Fort. Using Rulyrana's maps and their knowledge of Lycan fort building, their engineers are able to stealthily sabotage the Fort's defenses, as well as the outer walls. Coyote guards do eventually manage to spot the river elf saboteurs, but by the time they do it is far too late.</p>
    <p>The walls of the Fort crumble, as do the gatehouses and armories, leaving the Fort essentially indefensible. Further, a large breach is created in the outer wall as the blade and dark elf forces arrive, allowing them to enter the city and immediately begin their attack.</p>
    <p>This is where things start getting difficult. The Coyote officer in charge of the defenses, a man called Hawk, turns out to be surprisingly competent and shockingly ruthless. As the attack begins, the remaining division of soldiers abandons the ruined fort and make their stand in the city itself.</p>
    <p>Hawk uses the situation to his advantage. The river elves had deliberately left openings for civilians to evacuate, but Hawk deliberately traps civilians in harm's way. Thanks to the river elves a large number are able to escape, but hundreds are still left in the city and trapped between the two armies.</p>
    <p>Worse, Hawk sets up his headquarters at the church, the sturdiest building left standing. Matías had been using it as an emergency field hospital for civilians, but Hawk traps them there. He uses this group as leverage, threatening to kill them if his position is attacked or if the Militia lose their nerve.</p>
    <p>The desperate Militia fight with surprising ferocity. The blade elves are not used to close quarters urban fighting, and with Katiin unwillingly to risk massive civilian casualties she commands them conservatively. Their offensive quickly stalls, bogged down in the city. The dark elves attempt to help, but even though they manage to slip through the Militia lines unnoticed they are unable to unstick the defending force from their home turf.</p>
    <p>This goes on for weeks, then over a month. It starts to look like this is going to turn into a grueling urban siege. The blade elves begin establishing their own defenses, preparing for months of grueling urban operations.</p>
    <p>Litoria, Katiin, and Trischal consider their options. With the dark elf sappers hiding behind enemy lines and the river elves still holding the docks, the two stealthy forces could make a surprise attack on the church itself. The position is fortified and there are civilian lives in the balance, but they won't get another shot and the position will only get more fortified with time.</p>
    <p>That's when the Crag arrive. Furious at the "distraction" that the Coyote elves are causing, Echo descends from the mountains with the Euclast. Though they are the smallest force in the battle, they attack with shocking intensity. They don't even pause to rest. As soon as Echo has received a brief situation report, the Euclast attack the center of the Coyote forces and make a push for the stronghold.</p>
    <p>With fresh troops, experience in close quarters fighting due to their mountainous home environment, and an aggressive strategy that has little regard for collateral damage, the Crag immediately begin to tip the scales.</p>
    <p>This is causing a problem, however. Echo has only the barest cooperation with his ostensible allies, and appears to have a poor grasp of the situation. While they are handily succeeding tactically, Echo does not appear to understand the situation with the civilians. While they are definitely avoiding killing noncombatants, they do not appear to have the cultural context to understand why the Coyotes would hold their own people hostage and are thus ignoring it.</p>
    <p>Realizing that the Crag are going to have a breakthrough, Litoria and Trischal predict that the Crag will make a push for the church. With little heed for the delicate situation, the Crag's attack will be seen coming and thus doom the hostages in the building.</p>
    <p>With little choice and only a brief window, the dark and river elves decide that they must raid the church and free the hostages before the Crag break through the lines.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, the weather is on their side. When they launch this operation, the sun is setting and a rare rainstorm is rolling in.</p>
    <p>Using the poor visibility to their advantage, Trischal and Rulyrana scout the fortified church. The defenders have fortified the pavilion in front of the church, with infantry and archers watching the surrounding streets. They have built defensive barricades and scattered caltrops, broken glass, and sharpened stakes in the streets in front of the barricades. They have also deployed sharp eyed archers on the church roof, which Trischal is narrowly able to avoid being spotted by. The weather is on her side, for once. </p>
    <p>With the exterior scouted but the situation inside the church still unknown, the elves decide that they can't risk detection by getting too close to the building. They prepare for the attack with the information they have.</p>
    <p>The dark elf sappers decide that since patrols regularly watch the outside of the building, the safest way to breach the church's walls is to dig through the floor in a nearby building and then dig under the street and collapse the wall by destroying the foundation directly under it.</p>
    <p>Despite a bit of time lost from a surprisingly sturdily built apartment floor, the dark elves manage to tunnel under the street and sabotage the wall without being detected and in good time. Knowing it's the signal to attack, the veteran sappers pull the structural supports and cause the wall to collapse and create a hole.</p>
    <p>The rest of the dark elf sappers, led by Trischal, immediately rush the opening. Inside, they find nearly 150 civilians pressed against the back side of the building. Hawk and some of his elite infantry are guarding them. None of them expected this.</p>
    <p>Seizing the initiative, Trischal and the veterans descend on Hawk's group in a ferocious surprise attack. They press the advantage and the junior sappers surround the shocked infantry. Their attack decimates the unprepared infantry, completely disabling them and killing Hawk in the process.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, hearing the attack begin, the river elves immediately assault the most heavily defended section of the barricades. The Crocodilians hit it with shocking speeds and force, driving the defenders off the wall as the Archerfish's arrows pin down their allies. Riding Sauvier, Litoria punches a hole straight through the center of the barricade and the Crocodilians rush into the square.</p>
    <p>Seeing their defenses overwhelmed in mere moments, the remaining defenders retreat into the church while the rooftop arches attempt to force the river elves back. Inside, they encounter the dark elves.</p>
    <p>The dark elves form a defensive line, preventing the enemy soldiers from reaching the civilians. Eina and her healer team rush into the church and begin healing and evacuating the civilians with help from a very surprised Matías.</p>
    <p>The heavy infantry put their backs to the wall, preventing the dark elves from using their preferred tactics and flanking. Forced into a head on fight, the sappers do their best to hold the heavy infantry at bay while the civilians escape.</p>
    <p>Outside, the Crocodilians attempt to break into the church itself but come under fire from the rooftop archers. The Archerfish exchange fire, drawing the attention of the enemy marksmen.</p>
    <p>With surprising nerve, the lightly armed and armored sappers hold the line against the elite heavy infantry long enough for the civilians to escape. With the civilians safe and the defenses smashed, they make the call to fall back. They are taking casualties, and the Crag can handle what's left.</p>
    <p>The swift sappers and Crocodilians flee into the rainy night with the civilians in tow, having taken few losses for what they gained and leaving the fortifications ruined. They took out nearly half the defending forces.</p>
    <p>The Crag smash through the Militia lines and storm the church a couple of hours later. Surprisingly they find the enemy stronghold broken, with dozens of dead Coyotes in the streets. The remaining soldiers have holed up in the church itself.</p>
    <p>The church is a stone building.</p>
    <p>The Crag make short work of the walls and assault the soldiers within. Weakened, leaderless, and demoralized, they give up disappointingly quickly.</p>
    <p>With Coyote and Hawk dead, the soldiers defeated, and their families safe, the Militia quickly surrender the following day.</p>
    <p>Coldwater is yours, for now. Breaker is apparently coming to take control. If that is acceptable, Alpha Division volunteers to hold the city until Breaker returns.</p>
    <p>If you trust her, that is.</p>
    <p>Both of your units have avoided significant casualties.</p>
    <p>The Archerfish are still at Experienced I, but have made significant progress towards Experienced II.</p>
    <p>Note: Riverhaven is safe and Coldwater is under allied control. Katiin, leading the largest force, takes the responsibility of occupying Coldwater until Breaker can organize the Vaqueros to return to the city and presumably take control of it. </p>
    <p>The Angry Alligators were close enough to Oarsman's Rest that they were able to get there by the potluck, though just barely.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Frustratingly, Smilisca (the wizard) has trouble coming up with any new ideas or information that Staurois (the druid) hasn't already implemented. Staurois appreciates the help for certain, and Smilisca does help offload some of the record keeping. Smilisca is able to offer a few better methods for tracking  and recording the numerous variables involved that will last for many years, but other than that he isn't able to come up with much.</p>
    <p>Still, no harm done and the Navigator's demonstration of support for the project does increase the people's confidence in it. Really, only Smilisca is aware of how little he actually helped. Staurois even makes a big deal of how much help he was.</p>
    <p>Smilisca isn't sure if that helps or just makes it more frustrating.</p>
    <p>Arpenter's maiden journey is a wild success. The Brightwood is a huge benefit in traveling these rivers. The Marraine carves its course through the mostly barren western edge of the caldera rim, edging along the badlands. The terrain here is rough and dry, but the shallow river makes it passable. The Brightwood rafts are able to make the journey. At the river's end, they make a momentous discovery.</p>
    <p>There, in the muddied sandy soil, they find the remains of several hippopotami. Their rangers scramble to gather information about the area. The remains are relatively recent, only a few years old. Thankfully the rocky ground holds signs for much longer than normal terrain.</p>
    <p>The rangers find the telltale deeply worn trails that suggest hippos lived here. A lot of them, a full pod of dozens. Far, far more than the remains indicate. The rangers believe that a large pod of hippos once lived at this river. How they got there, they don't know. There isn't enough grass here to support the hippos, so they must have moved on, following the river further north.</p>
    <p>If these hippos still live, they would have to have found an environment favorable to them. It would have to be somewhere with relatively deep rivers or lakes as well as abundant grass, since grass is all they eat (and boy they eat a lot.)</p>
    <p>Congratulations! You have survived another year in your new homeland!</p>
    <p>You receive your usual skill point to be distributed as you wish (don't forget your tower,) but the end of this year marks a major occasion.</p>
    <p>The Coyotes posed a significant threat. This threat was addressed not just by one or two elven nations, but by all of you working together in a major combined operation. For the first time since the end of the war, you have displayed what you are capable of when the elves band together. Though your cooperation was tenuous at best and your ties still far from cemented, the display of force was quite impressive.</p>
    <p>Due to the lessons of this conflict that were shared among all allied elves, you receive the Civilization Aspect <i>Lessons of the Coyote War.</i></p>
    <p>This Aspect may be invoked if a situation may be helped by the lessons and experiences your elves received in this conflict.</p>
    <p>In addition, this Aspect provides a permanent upgrade to either one skill of your choice under the military branch or Logistics.</p>
