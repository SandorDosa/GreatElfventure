    <p><b>Economic:</b> Unable to justify any delay at all, Litoria sets to directing the new immigrants toward preparing their new Winter Quarters for the returning Partager flotilla.  They are welcomed with open arms and a tearful reunion.  Both the small group of Pathfinders and the growing group of lost immigrants seek familiar faces among their number, and find none.  Hope is not yet lost for them though, for Partager’s return may yet reunite some of these missing families.</p>
	<p>They roll 2 Ability and 1 Upgrade dice to set up a comfortable place to overwinter the flotilla: <kbd>1 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.  Feeling perhaps a bit bitter about the delay, they spend a Fate point to try again.  Winter Quarters are too important:  <kbd>1 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Taking extra care to avoid any potential spies learning the exact location of where in the swamp the river elves hibernate, Staurois directs the Eyes to be on the lookout.  </p>
	<p>This uses the <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> and rolls 1 Ability die: <kbd>0 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p><b>Military: </b>Litoria is highly concerned that they do not yet have a clear idea of what else could be in this swamp with them.  She sets the pathfinders back out to scout again.  They scout squares -3,4 and -4,4.  Using the <i>Pathfinders</i> trapping of <b>Reconnaissance</b> and rolls 2 Ability dice: <kbd>1 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b>  Smilisca and Eina sit down and have a conversation, not an argument, about how they should go forward. Spurred by the arrival of so many of the previously lost noncombatants, they feel it is a sign from Calestros or possibly the Resting themselves that more River Elves survived the chaotic aftermath of the war than they had previously imagined.</p>
    <p>"Mais, there hasta be some way to fin' em all," Smilisca pleads, "were I them I'd want to know we were still lookin, me."</p>
    <p>"Smilisca, I know," Eina answers, her voice trembling with the force of her restraint.  "We can't look errywhere at once, no? How'n we gon cover all that space?  I hear the Dreamdust Elves use magic to fin' water, an the Fire Elves are usin' in to fin' metal. You think we ken detect elves?"</p>
    <p>"Weh," Smilisca agrees, with hesitation, "mais no, not at the range we'd need ta reach as far as we need."</p>
    <p>"What if we don't fin' em?" Eina appears to deflate a bit, hope seeping out of her webbed grasp like silt in a strong current. </p>
    <p>"They'll fin' us." Smilisca attempts to bolster the cleric's usually undefeated confidence. </p>
    <p>“Weh...”  Eina contemplates for a moment.  “Smilisca, you thinkin we could do someut to makein tha’ easier?  Lie the bonfires to draw in a good year?  Some beacon to draw in da <span class="tooltip">ami<span class="tooltiptext">Friend</span></span>.”</p>
    <p>“Give me the <span class="tooltip">fressons<span class="tooltiptext">Shivvers</span></span>!” Smilisca exclaims with a shudder, “Mais that would draw in all kind of attentsion we do not want.”</p>
    <p>“What if we could make it something only we could sense?”  Eina places a gentle hand on the wizard’s knee.  “Somethin’ in the water?”</p>
    <p>“Non.”  Smilisca pauses, seeming to contemplate options.  “Weh.  Mais the risks if’n we done muck the thing up...”</p>
    <p>“Then we taken our time, weh?”  Eina grins at him, and gives him a slap on the shoulder.  “We’ll figure this out, weh.”</p>
    <p>	Before diving in headfirst to create another magic ritual, they stop and actually do the research first.  Acris, being absent, is not participating, but Eina’s shiny new helpers certainly are.  They roll one shiny Ability die to use the <i>Research</i> trapping of <b>Academics</b>: <kbd>2 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p><b>Misc:</b>Partager moves to Winter Quarters, just in time for autumn’s last leaves to fall.  There are a few joyful reunions as one elven family is reunited.  Sadly, it is only the one.  But their reunion gives the others, still waiting, a tiny amount of hope.  There could be others out there still.  There is a chance that not everyone is dead.  Eina, in particular, is buoyed by this news.  Perhaps her beloved is still out there.</p>
    <p>Ny has safely made it out of the queasy awful first trimester and is now working through the significantly less queasy and more heartburny second trimester.  Her condition has started to show undeniably and she and Staurois have celebrated with the flotilla as is appropriate for when the Oarmaster’s family will be growing.  Their fellow elves have decorated the Ranidae family raft with sharp citrus scented grasses to ward away mosquitos.  All are very excited for them.  River elves cherish all children, but this will be the first on Partager.</p>
    <p>After Partager arrives at the future home of Winter Quarters, Eina and Litoria sit down and have a very long conversation.</p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Gar ici<span class="tooltiptext">Look here</span></span>, Litoria, you can’t hide it.  I know when you’re troubled, me.”  Eina hands the older elf a basket of orchids.  “Sit a spell and tell me your troubles while we work.”</p>
    <p>Litoria takes the basket and starts helping Eina pluck the delicate stamens from where they nestle between the petals.  They’re a delicacy for seasoning, but not one used often, for the flowers are rare and their collection labor intensive.  The pair works in silence for a few minutes to find a rhythm to the task.</p>
    <p>“I been thinkin.”  Litoria empties her small work bowl into the shared jar.  “What makes someun en Elf?”</p>
    <p>“Pfoo-ee!” Eina exclaims, and then sighs heavily.  “You don’t ask an easy one, you.”</p>
    <p>“It’s not?”  Litoria looks, almost hopeful maybe, but also a bit confused.  Her grey skin blushes a dark green in embarrassment.</p>
    <p>“Foh shore, no.”  Eina folds her webbed hands in her lap for a moment.  “What do you think of when you say ‘Elf?’”</p>
    <p>“Mais, what you mean?”  Litoria starts to count off on her fingers when Eina gives only a smile to get her to continue, “Pointy ears, tree fingers en a thumb, agile, delicate, speaks Elven, ah - um - et peace wi nature?  Weh?”</p>
    <p>“An how many uh those apply ta you?  To any elf ya know?”  Eina picks up another flower and discets it carefully with a tiny little knife.</p>
    <p>Litoria pauses.  She rubs the blunt tips of her long ears.</p>
    <p>“We are no the best examples of elves, non?”  Eina laughs and kicks at the water slowly rolling passed the raft.  Her webbed toes make quite a splash.  “No, en Elf is much more en a list of things ya ken see.  It’s in tha hear’.”</p>
    <p>“How do we know, then?”  Litoria starts in on another of the flowers.  She removes its delicent center from the petals and stem.  “How ken we see into someone’s heart?”</p>
    <p>“Ask em.”</p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Dit mon la verite<span class="tooltiptext">Tell me the truth</span></span>.”  Litoria shoots the young cleric a dark look.  “Et can’t be that simple.”</p>
    <p>“Oh sha, it is though,” Eina leans over and their shoulders touch - skin to breathing skin, they support each other a moment.  “Ain’t none of us perfect, so you look an you see jus’ the broken pieces of what Calestros meant fer us.  Mais.  Together it’s a perfect, beautiful, whole.  All the differen’ ways of bein’ en Elf are parts of that Perfection.  If’n someone what recognizes that also recognizes that they’re part of it, who are we to disagree?”</p>
    <p>Litoria treads water on the thought for a moment.</p>
    <p>“Eina, what if they lie?”</p>
    <p>“What if they lie?”  Eina stops working to grasp the warmaster’s hand.  “Recognizing that piece of Perfection in someun who don’ see it in emself ain’t so horrible.  We ain’t less fer it.”</p>
    <p>“E’en if they make us a fool?  En take advantage?  En use it to hurt us?”  Litoria’s sharp little knife slips, punches a hole in her thumb.</p>
    <p>“Nah.”  Eina traces a faint sigil over Litoria’s injured finger.  “Someun does that, they’ll be the last ta try.  Warmaster, I know you’ll make sure of that, me.”</p>
    <p>The injured flesh knits closed, like it was never damaged at all.</p>
    <p>“I’ll finish these.”  Eina takes the bloody little knife from Litoria.  “You an’ Sauver go pass a spell in the river.  Rinse yer mind.”</p>
    <p>Litoria leans against her in response, a quiet confirmation of the support.  And then she slips off the raft into the brown depths of churned water below, breathing deep the cool flow.</p>
    <p>Eina faintly wonders what that could have really been about.  Surely, the Warmaster doesn’t distrust the Crag Elves that much?</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Misc:</b> Litoria receives a simple letter to her, delivered by a winged elf messenger late in the season.</p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter">I need to speak with you, if you would still speak to me after what you learned after I left.</p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter">This winter I will be waiting where you last saw me</p>
    <p>Though the letter has no name on it, she somehow immediately knows who its is from. With Winter Quarters set to thrive and no real emergencies to tend to, she makes her decision...</p>
    <p><b>Economic:</b>Congratulations! You have established the new settlement of Winter Quarters!</p>
    <p>It has the following stats -</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Name:</b> Winter Quarters</li>
        <li><b>Description:</b> Up to you</li>
        <li><b>Size:</b> Outpost</li>
        <li><b>Territory Aspects:</b>
            <li><i>Coastal Wetlands:</i> The terrain around Winter Quarters has a mix of freshwater, saltwater, and brackish tidal swamps, as well as a large mangrove forest.</li>
            <li><i>Vibrant Ecosystem:</i> The mangroves provide a perfect habitat for large amounts of marine life, both fresh and saltwater.</li>
            <li><i>Brightwood Grove:</i> The mangrove forest contains the previously unknown Brightwood Mangrove. They are few in number, so cultivation will take careful planning to be sustainable.</li></li>
        <li><b>Settlement Aspects</b>
            <li><i>Empty Slot</i></li></li>
        <li><b>Garrison:</b> One slot empty </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It was honestly an extremely easy setup. The pathfinder group had been planning on doing this for months, and the population of refugee river elves only made it easier. Indeed, this square turns out to be nearly ideal terrain for winter quarters. There should be ample opportunities in store here.</p>
    <p>Because of the high morale and excess supplies gathered by the Pathfinders, if you make an improvement to Winter Quarters next turn you will receive a bonus die.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Well now, things got interesting.</p>
    <p>Your eyes in the dark lived up to their name this turn. The location of Winter Quarters must be preserved, and this moment is perhaps its most vulnerable. This, for once, is truly their favored habitat. They spread out into the swamps around the Quarters, ready to intercept and curious outsiders.</p>
    <p>And that they do. To the south, the Eyes find a group of six elves with horses hiding out in the swamp. The Eyes are able to approach them undetected, to assess their motives. They discover the group closely matches the description of the “Coyote elves” that the Dreamdust elves gave you - same style of clothing, and apparent great skill with horses. Interestingly, they appear to mostly actually be half elves. Stubby ears and all.</p>
    <p>Your Eyes are able to monitor the group undetected for some time. Your lead spy reports a brief snippet of conversation they were able to hear. The Coyotes appear to speak a form of common, with words from a language that the spy didn’t understand mixed in.</p>
    <p>Regardless, your Eye repeats the conversation as best he can.</p>
    <p>“Mira, I told you Ratero, they’re night type.”</p>
    <p>“I fucking noticed, cabron. Shit, at least they didn’t have horses.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, you’re that tried to pick the lock, you’re the one that gets to tell Coyote what happened.”</p>
    <p>“Fuck that man, he’ll cut my cojones off! Mierda, we’ll just tell Breaker first. He can’t cut her balls off.”</p>
    <p>“Good idea, she’ll just pull you behind her horse for a few miles.”</p>
    <p>“Fuck, you're right, but I'd still have my balls!”</p>
    <p>“Orale! Yeah, though, you see all the shit they had at the hotel? Lot of fat pockets coming through. We stake out the roads around them and… Wait, you hear something? Aguas!”</p>
    <p>The Coyote put his fingers to his lips and made a sharp whistle.</p>
    <p>Your Eyes didn’t get much dialogue after that, as the Coyotes spread out looking for them. The Eyes did, however, get creative. They mimicked animal calls and howling, generally just being as creepy as possible. After a few hours leading them in circles, they were able to drive the Coyotes away from the swamp, cursing in whatever language it is that they speak.</p>
    <p>Your Eyes in the Dark got a little info on the Coyotes, and are confident that the Coyotes had no idea that they were being chased by river elves. The location of Winter Quarters is safe.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b>  Feeling more motivated, your Pathfinders successfully scout those two squares. In addition to the beloved River Aspect, the square closer to the coast has more Coastal Wetlands while the other has Grasslands, which probably lead to more plains to the west.</p>
    <p>While they don’t find anything shockingly exciting, they also don’t find anything dangerous. In addition, both these squares are suitable for farming and would be quite habitable for a flotilla to stop in.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b>   It quickly becomes apparent that a ritual like this will be a significant undertaking. It should be achievable - the sensitive skin of the river elves is a big advantage here. But what will the signal be? How will it travel water, something quite resistant to magic? How will you make it safe? How will it give the receiver information? How will they be able to interpret that information? It is a daunting task, but not an impossible one.</p>
    <p>It seems that frustratingly, all your elves are able to do is come up with more potential problems with the ritual. The good news is that they found these problems in research, not while actually trying to craft the spell. No one gets any migraines or anything, at the very least!</p>
