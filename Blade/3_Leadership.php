    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <h2>Central Leader</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Grandmaster Ehra Indrek</b> is an elderly elf who occupies the position of Grandmaster. The Grandmaster is responsible for preserving the traditions, martial and otherwise, of their people. It was one of the few cultural roles allowed by the Lycans, on the condition that it have no military rank. The Grandmaster serves as an advisor, teacher, and trainer to his people. Ehra is man of great wisdom and knowledge, and has held the position for so long there is scarcely anyone who can remember a time before he was Grandmaster. Ehra was one of the first Blade elves captured by the Lycans, though he was only a small child at the time and barely remembers it.</p>
    <p>Ehra saw generations of his Blade elves die, scarcely knowing who they were or where they came from, and after time this weighed heavy on his conscience. Doubt led him to secretly learn about and even contact outside elves. After learning the truth, Ehra made the difficult decision that his people needed to join the rebellion. His counsel was one of the major reasons the Blade elves changed sides. While he knows his decision was just, the deaths of thousands of elves who believed in his wisdom weighs on his old soul. </p>
    <p>Ehra is patient, pleasant, and genuinely supportive of those around him. He is often casually referred to as “grandfather” and appears to love the nickname. His amiable behavior may make some believe he has grown soft with age, but anyone who knows him realize he still has the sharpened mind of a master warrior. While technically simply an advisor and teacher to all, no blade elf makes major decisions without his approval.</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Wise grandfather of war<br/>
        Ehra has seen more conflict and made more difficult decisions than perhaps any mortal alive. His counsel is more valuable than gold.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Seriously Old<br/>
        Though his excellent physical conditioning has allowed him to age gracefully and appear centuries younger than he is, Ehra is nearing the end of his life and his body is becoming increasingly frail.

    <img class="avatar" src="Images/Warmaster.png">
    <p><b>Warmaster Katiin Paavi</b> is a young elf and the daughter of the previous Warmaster, Edvin Paavi. She distinguished herself as an excellent commander and led the Hussars, elite light cavalry derived from the highly mobile Lycan warfare practices, during the closing months of the war. Some were curious as to why the young daughter of the Warmaster received such a major role, but it was solely due to her competence. Blade elves don't do nepotism.</p>
    <p>During the battle of Skaplyndi, her father was killed and the Hussars suffered horrific casualties. The Hussars were essentially wiped out fighting toe to toe with Lycan elite cavalry. Her father’s last act was to take command of the Hussars and order Katiin to stay behind and take overall command if he fell. Having watched her father and closest friends die, she was immediately thrust into the role of Warmaster and commanded all Blade elves for the rest of the battle. Post war, this means she is the highest ranking officer and thus has the final say on most matters. She has held the position ever since, and acquitted herself well so far.</p>
    <p>Katiin has an intense personality and is prone to react with strong emotions, but is a kind and empathetic person at her core and keeps her emotions in check with professionalism most of the time. She is a passionate believer in the future of her people and of her newfound elven kin.</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> General with a heart of gold<br/>
        Katiin does an admirable job of balancing her compassionate nature with the ruthless pragmatism required of a wartime commander.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Something to prove<br/>
        Katiin is still young and unproven in the eyes of many, and some believe she should have died leading the Hussars instead of her father - perhaps including herself. She fears that her people do not trust her, and is anxious to prove her worth.

    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <img class="avatar" src="Images/Quartermaster.png">
    <p><b>Quartermaster Terje Paavi</b> is Katiin's older brother. He lacks his sister's passion and is stable and easygoing, at least for a blade elf. He had something of a troubled upbringing, causing trouble for the Lycans he resented. His father convinced him to stay out of trouble for everyone’s safety, but he was not cut out to be a general. Keen to stay out of the spotlight, he took on the role of quartermaster which has evolved into a central economic planner. His quietly rebellious attitude made him one of the first to embrace rebellion. Patient and observant, he is more than happy to take a backseat and support others.</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Grease for the gold machine<br/>
        Terje's laid back and likeable personality combined with his keen observation skills and intellect make him the grease that will get the gears of industry going.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Undisciplined black sheep<br/>
        Terje is highly undisciplined by blade elf standards, and many see him as unreliable or even dangerous as a result.
    </p></p>

    <h2>Spymaster</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <img class="avatar" src="Images/Bowmaster.png">
    <p><b>Bowmaster Taavet Rein</b> is the leader of the rangers, and de facto spymaster. Blade elf rangers have a reputation for being exceptional in battle and in special operations, but it remains to be seen how this applies to defense. Taavet is better at recon than spying, but his paranoia and attention to detail means he has a knack for counter espionage. He was Bowmaster for the rangers the entire war and for some time before, meaning he is paranoid and hypervigilant. Extremely slow to trust, somewhat abrasive. He is very slow to change his mind, and was one of the last to join Ehra's faction. He is highly critical and defensive, but believes in the future of the elves. His deeply held belief is that the Lycans will return, making him the founder of the secret society known as the Whetstones.</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Vigilant guardian of the elves<br/>
        Taavet is by far the most suspicious and devious minded of the blade elves, making him one of the few skilled at countering subterfuge.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Kind of an asshole<br/>
        No one likes this guy. Seriously. Look at him. He couldn't make a friend if you ordered him to.

    <h2>Councilor</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Corpsmaster Siiri Mar</b> is the chief alchemist and healer for the faction. With no access to divine healers under the Lycans and constantly being moved from place to place, Blade elves came to rely on alchemy based on commonly available and easily grown herbs. The Medic Corps was formed to formally train blade elves in their unique nonmagical healing practices. Most medics are blade elves who for some reason are not suited to combat. Siiri is one such individual, having been born with a malformed leg that made her unsuitable for combat. She did prove a master of herbal medicine however, and rose to the rank of Corpsmaster. Being keenly aware of the both the blood price of serving the Lycans and the likely cost of rebellion, Siiri joined Ehra's rebellion without hesitation as she knew it was the only way the people she cared for would ever find peace. She remembers nearly every death that decision cost.</p>
    <p>After the war, precious few noncombatants were left with the group, many of whom were part of the medic corps. Siiri became a defacto representative for these noncombatants, as she is the only high ranking non-soldier left. She is receptive to the needs of others and compassionate, but is very blunt about it and not afraid to confront others. She has a sharp wit born from decades of having to deal with glory seeking soldiers eager to jump on any sword they can find. Her distaste for war makes her the only core leader openly supporting the Gladeseekers. She is very protective of her fellows, particularly Ehra.</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Salty healer<br/>
        Siiri's razor wit and dry cynicism covers up a compassionate and deeply scarred soul.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Overprotective<br/>
        Siiri still mourns every life the war took, which makes her overly protective of her fellows and hesitant to support actions that put them at risk.
