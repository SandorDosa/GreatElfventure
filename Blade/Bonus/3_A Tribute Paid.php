<h1>A Tribute Paid</h1>
<p>Ten miles outside Riverhaven, year 3</p>
<p>The Charred Eagles stood in formation, waiting for the Coyote Elves to make their approach. The Elect stood at the front, in phalanx formation, with their banners held high in the back ranks. The Ashen stood behind them, along a row of sharpened logs hastily shoved into the dirt just in front, while the Milites stood in loose lines to their right, ready to reinforce the Elect if needed. </p>
<p>In front of the Milites, just past the lines of the Elect, sat the Surtian Horse.</p>
<p>Ten feet at the shoulder and eighteen feet in length, the statue had been carefully carved from wood, stone, and plaster, to feature a lifelike Coyote Elf stallion bending down as if kneeling in supplication. The entire statue had been painted a light palomino. A cask stuck out from a sliding rack carefully built into the horse’s lower jaw.</p>
<p>The Terror loomed in front of it. </p>
<p>A couple of her aides stood a few paces behind her, scanning the area for surprise visitors, while another stood by the Horse itself, holding the ropes for the statue’s wheeled platform. </p>
<p>And Dust was there too, quietly blending into the scenery.  His usual small bright notes of color are all hidden in favor of earth tones.  </p>
<p>The first sign of the Coyotes' arrival is dust on the horizon. Winged elf scouts report moments later. Nearly three hundred Cazadores, led by Breaker. The riders split up as they approach, sending groups to the flanks of the fire elves. Thankfully, they stop a respectful distance out and don't try to advance past the traps. </p>
<p>A small band breaks off from the central group. About five riders. Breaker is in the lead, with a banner emblazoned with a stylized coyote tied to her glaive and held high. The group approaches with their glaives held up at the ready.</p>
<p>Breaker rides a golden tan horse, with an embroidered brown poncho over riding clothes and a scavenged Lycan cavalry breastplate. She has tan skin, dark hair, and furiously intense eyes. In the band of her broad brimmed hat is tucked a white feather with a black tip, unmistakably one of Shadimon's.</p>
<p>She eyes the Surtian horse with an amused expression as her horse trots up towards Terror.</p>
<p>"Pues, you've got a sense of style I'll fucking give you that," she looks Terror up and down with an impressed whistle, "And you're the big bad bitch herself, the Terror. What you got for us?" </p>
<p>As if she hadn't even noticed Breaker's words, the Terror casually pulled a few apple slices from a pack at her side, and held them out to Breaker's horse. The horse looks at the apple slices with interest, but a slight tap of her finger on the horse’s neck kept it still. Breaker glanced at the slices, then at the armored figure holding them out.</p>
<p>“If you poison my horse I’m gonna fucking kill everyone you’ve ever met, you know that si?” She asks the Terror. </p>
<p>The Terror tossed a slice back over her shoulder, to one of the aides standing a pace behind. He caught it with rehearsed ease, and shoved the whole slice straight into his mouth. The horse makes an annoyed snort and glances at Breaker.</p>
<p>“Si, bueno,” she sighs, “<span class="tooltip">Tu quieres, es tu funeral.<span class="tooltiptext">Sure if you want, it's your funeral.</span></span>”</p>
<p>Breaker taps her horse on the neck again and it leans over to take a few of the slices.</p>
<p>Dust, if anyone looks at him, appears to be questioning his life choices. And his leadership.  And his presence here.  And Terror’s sanity.  And wondering if he can make friends with the horse later.</p>
<p>The Terror opens her palm, letting Breaker's horse chow down on the remaining apple bits, before giving the horse a polite pat on the nose. Her gaze fell on Breaker, and she pointed a thumb at the giant horse statue behind her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I noticed that,” Breaker gives the armored figure an annoyed look, “I’m more interested in what’s in it.”</p>
<p>She whistles at a few of her escorts and they trot over to the horse and begin examining it, particularly the cask that is visible.</p>
<p>“Your <span class="tooltip">perro<span class="tooltiptext">dog</span></span> said it’d have a lot of nice goods in it,” she explains, “We’re not gonna take that on reputation, si? What’d he say? Oils, fine alcohol?”</p>
<p>Dust takes a couple steps forward.  “Both.  With the short notice, we mostly had to bring things with long shelf lives.”</p>
<p>Breaker turns to Dust with a frown, “Hey, you’re that <span class="tooltip">brujo<span class="tooltiptext">Witch (masculine)</span></span> who talked my ear off in a fucking dream aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Dust grins, showing teeth, and shrugs.  “Looks like you’ve still got both ears.” </p>
<p>The Terror sighed -- a sound like a carburetor going through a garbage disposal. She gave Dust a quick shake of her head.</p>
<p>Breaker gives Terror a quick glance before turning back to Dust, “Yeah, stay out of my head brujo. Only warning.”</p>
<p>Dust shrugged and nodded acknowledgement.  </p>
<p>There is a whistle from the Surtian horse. The Coyotes have finished giving it a look over. One of the Yotes gives Breaker a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“So it’s full of the shit you said you’d give us. Bueno,” she turns to Terror, “So what’s the trap?”</p>
<p>“Well, this was last minute.  So a bit of the alcohol is from us.  Which means it’s fermented goat’s milk.”  Dust smiles politely.  “I’m told it’s an acquired taste, but it’s very high quality.”</p>
<p>Breaker makes a flat face, “Yeah, I had some of that after we stole it from you last time. Tastes like mierda, but knocks you on your ass,” she turns back to Terror, “De verdad. What’s the catch? Gonna hit us while we start loading it up? Or while we pull back? Sounds like something you’d do.” </p>
<p>The Terror chuckled. It still sounded like tires squealing. “I wanted a better look at you,” she said, in a voice dry as a lich’s whisper.</p>
<p>Dust’s eyebrows go up.</p>
<img src="../Images/DustBrows.gif">
<p>“<span class="tooltip">Aquí estoy<span class="tooltiptext">Here I am</span></span>,” Breaker takes off her hat and holds her arms open wide, “What, like what you see? Ah, but it’s your show.”</p>
<p>She flips her hat back onto her head and checks to make sure that the feather has stayed in place. Her eyes flick to Dust suspiciously.</p>
<p>“If it were you, I’d guess poison. Maybe drugs. Get us all sick, mess up our leadership, maybe try to swoop in, no? At least worse than the milk booze would do. It ain’t your horse, though, it’s hers.”</p>
<p>Breaker turns back to Terror and leans forward, planting an elbow on her knee, “It’s you. If you wanted to kill me, you seem like the type to have tried already, si?”</p>
<p>The Terror stared at her.</p>
<p>Breaker cocks her head a little and looks Terror in the eyes quietly for a moment, “So if I were you, how would I fuck me up?”</p>
<p>Her eyes lead away from the Terror momentarily and--</p>
<p>“Later,” the Terror said quietly. “On a better field than this.”</p>
<p>Breaker’s attention doesn’t waver as she looks back at the Surtian horse. Her eyebrows furrow as she stares at it. A few long moments pass.</p>
<p>“<span class="tooltip">Madre diosa<span class="tooltiptext">Mother goddess</span></span>,” Her eyes suddenly go wide and snap back to Terror, “Oil, high grain booze, wood… it’s all fucking <i>flammable!</i>”</p>
<p>“What isn’t, out here?” Dust says dryly, but is mostly drowned out.</p>
<p>Breaker whips her glaive under her arm, still staring wide eyed at Terror, “<span class="tooltip">Hija de mil puta<span class="tooltiptext">Daughter of a thousand bitches</span></span>, you <i>bitch</i>! You fucking <i>monster</i>! You aren’t aiming for me, you’re looking to do the same thing to Coldwater that the fucking wolves did to you!”</p>
<p>“You believe we care so little for Shadimon that we would burn him alive?”  Dust’s voice is icy.  “Good to know how highly coyotes value their friends.”</p>
<p>For a moment, the tip of Breaker’s glaive wavers.</p>
<p>This time, the Terror laughed much harder -- a full throat belly laugh, clear as a bell. "You really are Coyote's second, aren't you? So full of yourself, so cocksure, so certain. 'Those Fire Elves fear us!' you say to yourself. 'They'll prepare a trap! They want to burn us just like they were once burned.' You aren't, Breaker Cazares. I came to see what we stood against, but all I see today are dead elves."</p>
<p>She turned her back to Breaker, and marched over to Dust. "Take the Horse or leave it," she said. "Be seeing you."</p>
<p>“Don’t you <i>fucking walk away from me</i>!” Breaker screams.</p>
<p>Her horse is moving before anyone can protest. She bolts past Terror and whips around, throwing up a dust cloud as she goes. She levels the glaive again and stares at Terror with wild eyes.</p>
<p>“You want to kill me? Fine! Make your move! You think I’m dead? Maybe I am!” Her voice is uncontrolled and unsteady, “But don’t you fucking dare try to burn my people behind me! You want to kill, kill me, not fucking civilians!” </p>
<p>“And the civilians at Asavardi?” The Terror said, her voice back to the dry dust from earlier. “Riverhaven?”</p>
<p>“Si.” Breaker’s voice drops several volume levels, “I’m a bad fucking person. Loco. At least I fucking admit it.” </p>
<p>“Admission is not the same as change.”</p>
<p>Breaker’s glaive lowers slightly, “I got something to say, but first? I want you to swear to me that you weren’t going to use that thing on innocent people in Coldwater.” </p>
<p>“I won’t… because you are not the only bad person here. We viewed your assault on Asavardi as proof you’d kill civilians, and made to return the favor. </p>
<p>“You were right,” the Terror continued. “The Horse is a trap. And maybe we were stepping too far as well. But I will <i>not</i> stand by and let bandits raid our sisters to the South, and you can be certain all of Surt stands behind me. </p>
<p>“I’d rather not kill you on this damnable field, Breaker, but if that is necessary to get it into your thick skulls that your behavior will not be tolerated, then <i>so be it</i>. Tell Coyote that our tribute is dust and ash, because that is all we have left to give.</p>
<p>“I do see dead elves here. They’re all of us, because we decided to fight and parasitize each other on the Empire’s corpse, <i>just like they always said we would.</i></p>
<p>“I’m not telling Coyote <i>shit</i>.” Breaker practically spits the words on reflex, then stares at Terror. She closes her eyes and takes a few breaths, “I’m not telling him shit other than ‘<span class="tooltip">buenas dias hijueputa<span class="tooltiptext">Good day motherfucker</span></span>’ because the next time I see him I’m gonna fucking kill him.”</p>
<p>She gives Terror a level look, “And I need your help to make that happen.”</p>
<p>Terror paused. “Well, you can borrow our giant statue full of alcohol. ...We were hoping you’d put it in the fort, anyway. It won’t burn through stone, and starts slow enough to give civilians time to evacuate. The whole point was to make the Fort useless for a few seasons.” </p>
<p>Dust stares at them both, utterly expressionless. There is, however, a general air of <i>what the fuck</i> about him.</p>
<p>“<i>Fuck</i> me,” Breaker whispers, “That might actually work!”</p>
<p>She looks up and her eyes dart between Dust and Terror, “Bien, here’s what’s up. If we talk, we gotta talk fast. Plenty of the Cazadores are loyal to Coyote, and if they see me getting too friendly with you the gig is up.”</p>
<p>She gestures at the feather in her hat, “Shadimon gave me this willingly. He told me winged elves give feathers to people who are friends, family, or important to you. He said I’m not a friend or family, but I’m definitely important.”</p>
<p>She fishes something out of her pocket and holds it out. It’s the sheriff’s star that Shadimon had been carrying, “Shadimon proved to me that Coyote killed my dad and faked his betrayal. I’m gonna kill the hijueputa for that. It ain’t as easy as walking up to him and stabbing him, cuz he sure as shit has a plan for that. I got people, people who are loyal to me. If I take a shot and miss, they’re as good as dead.”</p>
<p>She looks to Dust, “So I need to get them out of Coldwater. I got Cazadores on that list, si, but they got families. Wives, husbands, kids, <span class="tooltip">abuelitas<span class="tooltiptext">little grandmothers</span></span>. Cazadores can make it in the desert, but not them. We need somewhere to go. Somewhere they can stay.</p>
<p>“In return, I’ll get you Cazadores, as many as I can convince to come with me. I’ll set off your stupid horsebomb in the fort. Hells, I’ll have to. It’ll give me a distraction long enough to get my people out. I’ll take my people and run, hells, maybe try and get some extra horses for you on the way out. I’ll switch to your side, on one other condition: Coyote fucking dies. We got a deal, si or no?”</p>
<p>Breaker looks at the other two elves. </p>
<p>Terror glanced sideways at Dust. “Surt has room, and food,” she said, “but it is some distance, and your people have fewer defenders. Cazadore protection would help you.” </p>
<p>"The civvies won't make it as far as Surt. There ain't a Coyote born who can't ride, but some of these people are little kids, elderly, or infirm. Hells, we still have wounded from Asavardi. They won't last long in open desert." Breaker turns to Dust with an expression that shockingly has some small amount of sympathy, "<span class="tooltip">Si puedes<span class="tooltiptext">If you can</span></span>. I'll be level. When Coyote figures out where we've gone, he'll come after us with all the devils of hell he can get behind him. Wherever we go will be a target. I know what we did to you. I know what I'm asking." </p>
<p>Dust considers her plea. "Coyote dead, Shadimon safe with us." He stares at her.  "How many people? Civilians, we can accept for sure. Cazadores will be tougher. If they want to come inside the settlement, we <i>will</i> be reading minds to make sure nothing is planned against us." He exhales slowly. "If they're willing to help when Coyote follows… yes."</p>
<p>Breaker grins ferociously at Dust "Brujo, when Coyote comes you wouldn't be able to stop us from joining that fight even with a thousand of her in the way," she jerks her head at Terror, "Si, deal. It'll be hard, but I'll grab the pollo on my way out. I owe him that much. I… don't know how many people are going to be with me. At most? Three hundred civvies and two hundred Cazadores. Probably less. You only got to worry about the civvies. We've spent years in the desert before, we can camp in the field and feed ourselves. And si, I'll accept whatever conditions you got for taking them in." </p>
<p>"We can manage that many. Folks may be sleeping elbow to elbow, but we should be able to handle it."  He considered. "Usually in case of urgent messages, we send them via the dreams. You got anyone you trust who'd be willing to pass them on to you? It's one-way, but good in a pinch."</p>
<p>"No," Breaker shakes her head, "Just me, Brujo. Send 'em my way, ain't got much of a choice." </p>
<p>"Alright. I'll only do it if it's urgent news." Dust glanced at Terror and back to Breaker. "Anything else we need to discuss? Or shall we start yelling again, for our audience?" </p>
<p>Terror nodded, and made a noise like a ghost going through a meatgrinder.</p>
<p>"'Bout that," Breaker turns to Terror, "Coyote knows it's a trap. He just doesn't know what the trap is. If I drag this thing into Coldwater having politely chitchatted, he'll be suspicious. Some of these pendejos watching, they're loyal to him."</p>
<p>"So the only way for Coyote to buy it is if he thinks the trap's already been sprung," She levels her glaive at Terror with a mad grin, "So what do you say, <span class="tooltip">espanta<span class="tooltiptext">Terror, fearful, horrible, threat, ghost (feminine)</span></span>? Let's make this look good!" </p>
<p>The Terror leveled her hammer, shook out her shoulders, and snarled (forcing the ghost through a fine metal sieve). She nodded, and her figure began to blur like an oilsmear on glass. </p>
<p>Dust backs away, then backs further away, into the trapped area. </p>
<p>The Terror <i>twisted</i>, and suddenly there were six of her, in a rigid M formation, all advancing on Breaker at once. Within seconds all six were on Breaker’s right, hammers swinging towards her midsection.</p>
<p>"What the fuck!?" Breaker yells in a voice that does not exactly require acting.</p>
<p>Her horse rears back, startled by the oncoming mass of rage and magic. Breaker leans back and directs her horse to come down on top of Terror, hooves first. The horse swings wildly at the confusing blurred shapes. There’s a slight clang of horseshoe on metal, but a puff of ashen smoke as one of the images disappears into smoke and ash. The horse whinnies and pulls backwards. </p>
<p>Breaker whips her glaive around and takes swift horizontal strikes a the closest form. She hits nothing but air and illusion. More ash and smoke cloud the Terror’s position as the mass of smoky blurred forms swing out hammers in all directions, aimed at Breaker. She flips her glaive back to defend herself and hisses through her teeth. </p>
<p>She pauses for a half a heartbeat, then sweeps defensively with her glaive. It whips through several illusory hammers before connecting with the real one with a clang. Breaker presses through and swats it aside, but Terror whips it around for another strike. Like a mark keeping her eye on a shell game, Breaker watches the real hammer and jerks her torso out of the way.</p>
<p>The Terror moves with a supernatural speed that Breaker is not prepared for. Before she can adjust for another strike, Terror’s hammer is back. Breaker barely has time to twist her torso sideways to roll with the blow. There is a resounding clang that covers the crack of breaking ribs. Breaker gasps for air and pulls her horse to the side with her knees. Breaker hears a rattling, roaring noise from the Terror and sees two points of rage-filled light looming out of the mass of illusion and smoke.</p>
<p>“Mierda, they weren’t fucking kidding about you!” Breaker gasps. </p>
<p>As her horse reels out of the way, Breaker swings low sideways on her saddle and pulls a wide swipe where Terror’s center of mass should be. Politely, of course, turning the flat of the blade sideways once it’s no longer visible in the roiling confusion of magic that surrounds the Terror. It connects with Terror’s abdomen with a dull thud. Breaker leans into it, transferring as much of her and the horses’ momentum into it before pulling away.</p>
<p>A piercing whistle drives the horse away from the Terror. Breaker glances back to see the furious warrior pursuing, impossibly fast for someone on foot. Still not fast enough. Breaker drops her glaive, holding the head to the sand to leave a rooster tail of dust behind her. She reels her horse around in the dust cloud and braces for a charge.</p>
<p>“They weren’t kidding about me either, Espanta!” Breaker bellows as her horse breaks into a full gallop.</p>
<p>She whips her glaive up from the ground and swings it above her head with both hands. She stares at the charging form of the Terror, watching the twisting smoke-blurred form with careful eyes. She whistles again, driving her horse faster. Her eyes dart around the confusing mass of illusions before suddenly focusing.</p>
<p>With a scream, Breaker whips the head of her glaive around behind her back. It cuts through the Terror’s illusion, though once again she twists to hit with the flat of the blade. She puts the horse’s full momentum into the blade, and it connects with something vital. There is a resounding crunch and a shock of impact that goes up Breaker’s arms. She pushes through until she’s nearly pulled off her horse, then twists and pulls back.</p>
<p>Terror’s form is lifted fully off the ground then crumples. Breaker laughs viciously. She turns her head to adjust her horse’s path and regain control. She drops her glaive to the dirt again, dropping another dust cloud. She begins to pull around for another charge, though it might not even be-</p>
<p>Terror is upon her already. Breaker barks with surprise and tries to bring her glaive up for a block, but it’s too late. Terror has leapt fully into the air and is bringing her hammer down with a furious scream like twisting metal. Breaker tries to roll away, but the blow connects with her shoulder with a crunch and a pop. She shrieks in pain as her shoulder is dislocated. </p>
<p>The scream of pain shifts to one of anger as Breaker immediately grabs her arm and pops it back in her socket. She grabs her glaive and whips it over her head, displaying the Coyote banner for all to see.</p>
<p>“Alright Espanta,” Breaker smiles and yells loud enough for all to hear, “I’m impressed. Let’s see what you can do in a real fucking fight.”</p>
<p>Breaker makes a barking howl like a coyote. There is a clamour in the desert around them. The Coyotes pack together with a din of beating hooves. They are preparing for a charge on all sides of the defending fire elves.</p>
<p>The Terror waved her Earthbreaker through the air. Behind her, the Milites and Ashen ranks rushed back to behind the hasty picket line; the Elect solidified into formation, dropping their glaives into position to repel charges from any direction. Terror’s aides darted back to the front lines.</p>
<p>“Espanta,” Breaker lowers her voice, “You were fucking right about me.”</p>
<p>The horse breaks off at a full gallop. Breaker holds her banner high and starts literally barking orders at her soldiers. They spread out and prepare for a full encirclement and charge. Breaker shoots a rude gesture at Terror as she rides away. </p>
<p>The Terror stood for a few seconds and watched Breaker ride, before launching herself at full speed back to the Elect’s formation. </p>
<p>By then the Elect were moving back through the picket edge, with only a few forward lines still in front of the trapzone. Terror shot past them, trailing smoke, before coming to a stop just in front of the Ashen archers, who were already drawing arrows and prepping for their first shots.</p>
<p>She glanced around for Dust. </p>
<p>Dust steps to one side, making himself visible behind the row of archers. </p>
<p>“They won’t charge through your traps,” Terror said. She turned back towards the Coyote lines. “They’ll take their prize and go, rather than risk heavy casualties. We’ll stay until we’re certain they are leaving, and then pull all the way back to Riverhaven.”</p>
<p>“Also…” She turned back towards Dust. Her smoke halo dissipated, leaving ash scattered across her shoulders like snow. “No one will ever believe you.” </p>
<p>Dust's eyebrows went up. They had been getting quite a workout. "We read minds," he points out. "Why wouldn't they?" </p>
<p>“Because I volunteered to lead my troops in your defense, and I’m asking politely not to mention it.” </p>
<p>"'Please don't mention this' is a very different thing from 'no one will believe you'," Dust says mildly. "Maybe lead with the first one next time." </p>
<p>“Nope.” There’s a lot more “screeching tire compactor” in her voice at this point. </p>
<p>Dust's eyebrows are speaking volumes about Terror's social skills, or lack thereof. "I won't mention the talking. Probably." </p>
<p>“You’re the hero of this round, anyway,” Terror said mildly. “I was about to swing at her before you tried ‘we wouldn’t burn our friends.’ It was a good call.” </p>
<p>"Thanks," Dust sighed. "She's desperate and scared and this could still go badly, but we've got a chance now. That was an amazing bit of fighting, too. I think you impressed everyone." </p>
<p>“Good,” the Terror said. “So don’t mention it. My ego doesn’t need the help, trust me.” </p>
<p>Dust shrugs. "As you like. We'll need to recap for the others, but we can summarize that part." His gaze rakes across her. "How hurt are you? Let's go get you patched up and get out of here." </p>
<p>Terror shook her head. She propped the head of her hammer onto the ground, put her hands against her stomach -- right where Breaker’s glaive had struck her -- and… blinked. Her hands dropped back to her hammer. “I’m fine,” she said, glancing back up at Dust. “And that’s what the troops need to see, anyway. ...We’ll pull back as soon as the Coyotes make their withdrawal. We don’t want to leave ourselves unguarded.” </p>
<p>Dust nodded, and turned back to watch the Coyotes. As they converge and close on the fire elf lines, a high pitched whistle cuts over the sound of hooves. Breaker rides out in front and holds her banner out sideways, slowing the line to a halt. They stop a couple hundred feet from the fire elf line, waiting uneasily.</p>
<p>Behind them, other riders hitch the waiting tribute to a handful of extra horses and begin to haul it away. As it moves off, the Coyotes slowly break off to follow. Breaker leaves last, holding her banner high. She gives an almost imperceptible nod towards Terror before she leaves. The head of the Surtian horse slowly starts to disappear towards the horizon in a cloud of dust.</p>
