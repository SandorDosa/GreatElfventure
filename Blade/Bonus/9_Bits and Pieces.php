    <h2 id="1">Shadimon and Hunger</h2>
    <p>Shadimon finds Hunger in the relative quiet near the tables of food. “I’m not sure what I was expecting, but I don’t think this is it,” he says to the fire elf. “Do you have a moment? I need advice again, and I’d rather have it out in person.” </p>
    <p>The Hunger leans back against a nearby table. “Certainly. I take it my advice helped?” </p>
    <p>“I hope it does, because the political situation has caught a downdraft these past couple seasons. Now I’m at the point of preventing riots <i>before</i> I can even start any real form of government.” He sighs, adjusting the infant he’s still carrying, “So the advice I need is on how to handle multiple conflicting political factions, none of whom are technically <i>wrong</i>, without the entire thing exploding.” </p>
    <p>"Aha." Hunger coughs. "<i>Politics.</i> I wasn't expecting you to have to worry about that before your government actually forms, but I suppose that isn't terribly surprising, given the fun we've all been having of late." He glances over at Lucinia, still hiding behind Fury. "Be forewarned, my advice on this isn't and cannot be perfect -- not only is there no certain way to handle competing groups with equivalent fairness and impartiality, but we haven't been perfectly successful either.</p>
    <p>"What I can tell you is that the strongest method I know of for handling competing interests is this: set them against each other." He gestures to Barry, who is currently lounging by a snack table, munching on River Elf canapes. "Leafstorm and his Phoenix Imperialis is something of a success story there. By allowing both they and their competitors, the Ashen, the space to argue over the course of the nation while we in the Triumvirate instead work to enact policy, we both gave them the chance to grow into a more stable and useful organization, and allowed their better ideas the chance to grow to fruition. And also ignored their stupider ones.</p>
    <p>"The opposite of this would be the Ashen." Hunger sighs. "On the one hand, they are now stable, and provide a beneficial service. On the other, they were pretty much being run by the Wolf Elves up until last season." </p>
    <p>Shadimon has been listening intently with the particular look of someone taking detailed mental notes, but all his feathers slick down at that last statement. “That bad? How did that happen?” </p>
    <p>“The ultimate problem with centralized leadership -- a single point of failure. In this case… I’m afraid our friend ‘Faustus’ cornered Tsun in the ruins outside of Surt three years ago, and managed to con her into accepting a geas effect ‘in the name of helping Surt’. Which, given that she was able to report this to us, is probably still better than just flat out killing her would have been -- but not by a lot, and I may be a biased source on that. Terror and I are planning on having a full discussion on it with senior leadership here, somewhat later, in as secure an area as possible. In summary, however… one of the two groups we have dedicated to maintaining our internal security had been compromised for three years, as a direct result of the political interests of its leadership being manipulated by foreign interests. And I’m even more convinced that this ‘Faustus’ is our late, great, and overweight Muspelhami governor.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon’s stare goes distant for a moment as he runs through the organizations in Asavardi. “Mother’s breath, they’ve been going after you. We...anticipated that they might turn to us, if they haven’t already, once they get wind that we’re having trouble. We’ve been working on countermeasures, which I’ll also bring up in that secure meeting.” He shakes out his tense shoulders, “Right...let me...give you a bit more detail about <i>our</i> situation, and you tell me if letting them go at each other seems wise.”</p>
    <p>He drums his fingers on the blanket for a moment, and ends up with one finger caught in a tiny fist. “So...we have a very loud faction that fully supports an organized government. But they’ve also used phrases like ‘drag people along kicking and screaming’ and ‘for their own good’. That largely consists of recent immigrants who’ve been hiding out in human lands, and have gotten a bit more...abrasive than average.</p>
    <p>“The other major group wants no organization at all. You may not know our history really, but we’ve never had anything more than small, scattered villages, most of which didn’t even have their own central leader, let alone any kind of broader organization. The main system of organized government we’ve seen is...the Empire. To these people, any kind of central organization or power is inherently corrupting, and they’re already calling <i>me</i> a tyrant for what little we’ve done-” </p>
    <p>A strained chuckling sound echoes from behind Hunger’s mask. It takes Shadimon a second to realize that Hunger is trying not to laugh. </p>
    <p>“Thanks,” Shadimon says dryly. “But what part of this specifically are you laughing at?” </p>
    <p>Hunger covers his mouth, shaking. “My apologies,” he gasps. “I’m just… they called you a <i>tyrant?</i> ...I’m so proud.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon throws up his free hand, “Yes they did, while lobbing a rotten tomato at me, in the middle of a speech, if you must know.” </p>
    <p>The Hunger laughs. “<i>And</i> a rotten tomato! Oh, this is <i>excellent!</i> You must really be getting their attention!” </p>
    <p>Shadimon opens his mouth, but an odd gurgling noise interrupts him. He glances down, and the baby is also giggling, waving his chubby fists. “Really? You too? And after you’ve been all of <i>no</i> help to me.” He sighs, “I’m glad at least that you don’t seem to think this is as much of a disaster as it felt to me.” His ears go down as his wings tuck against his back, “I’m not...used to being publically disliked. And yelled at.” </p>
    <p>“Just wait until they accuse you of being a werewolf,” Hunger says flatly. “...I’m smiling, in case the mask doesn’t make that clear. And I’m not mocking you for your reaction. No one enjoys public disapproval, myself usually included. The public can be as needy, whiny, and unaware of itself as a baby -- no offense meant, tiny elf-child -- and their tendency to act out can result in some very painful consequences. But the point is they’re acting out. You have their <i>attention</i> -- which is far, far better than the alternative. In most cases, the anarchists of any society that had previously not had much of a government to speak of will ignore anyone trying to set up a real government. But they’re not ignoring you. They’re angry at you, trying to influence you, and maybe even a little scared of you. And that’s <i>good.</i></p>
    <p>“The person who throws tomatoes at you is one of the people you want to talk to, because they’re a solid indicator that at least some part of their group is energized. They’ve got opinions they want to express; values they want registered. Even to the point of risking public disapproval and violence themselves. And that means congrats to them, because now <i>they’re part of it.</i> </p>
    <p>“So based on your description, there are a couple of different methods available to you. You’ve got two groups with opposite goals, neither of which is particularly trustworthy -- one keeps using language that screams ‘murder the opposition’, while the other employs fruit-violence in situations they don’t like.</p>
    <p>“They both have to live in the same society, however, and that means they have to put up with each other whether they like it or not. </p>
    <p>“One of your options -- which is honestly the one I generally prefer -- is ‘assumed impartiality’. Inform both sides that you want their opinion, but they’ll have to meet in the middle, or neither side will be happy with the result. Your anarchists don’t like the idea of a real government? Let them know there’s an entire other chunk of society that wants to, and that the best thing for both of them would be to come to an agreement. If you’re okay with playing the villain, tell them they need to form a coalition or you’ll ignore both of them; that way they’ll have to try to play moderate with each other in order to ‘keep you in check’. If not, find the members of them you like that are most agreeable, and start talking to them -- first separately, and then together. Make them try to find common ground. They’ll never agree with each other one hundred percent, but that’s on them, and that’s where the competition will come in. The point is to make it clear that you’ll only listen if they’re talking, rather than tomato-ing.” </p>
    <p>“I do at least have an in with...they’re calling themselves Cynics. After one of the anarchists chucked the tomato, someone <i>else</i> whipped around and decked them in the face. That one was willing to be...apprehended? And we talked. I’ve been trying to talk to people, but it’s...a <i>lot</i> more people than I expected. I <i>do</i> want to hear from them. I can’t do anything until I know what they want beyond ‘our way or nothing’. How do you even arrange something like that? I was absolutely mobbed any time I went out in public this entire last season.” </p>
    <p>The Hunger pauses. “This is where delegation, and having the Terror around, is particularly useful, but in your case… probably one of the best methods would be to aim for blunt bureaucracy. They don’t want a government? Well, tough, you can’t talk to everyone at once and expect to get anything done. Tell them they need to choose some representatives -- elves they think best argue for and support their interests -- so you can invite those elves to a close-quarters meeting, to really hash it out. Get a scribe to take notes of the whole thing, and then slap those notes somewhere public so that the Cynics know their reps are accountable for what they say. And if those reps missed something? Tell them to try to go to the other reps first -- you’re busy.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon looks thoughtful, “That...is a good idea. Ridiculously, the <i>Anarchists</i> are more organized, of the two groups. They might already have actual leadership. I’m lacking in armored enforcers, but blunt intimidation wouldn’t help the ‘tyrant’ impression anyway.” He sighs, “Thank you. I don’t know yet if it’ll work, but it’s much more than I had originally. I also have some ideas to undercut both groups and try to boost a more moderate middle ground, but I need information that I just don’t have. But truly, thank you.” </p>
    <p>The fire elf nods. “Happy to help. It sounds like you’re getting along pretty well, at the very least. They’re paying attention to you.” He pauses. “And watch the leadership of both sides. Especially with the Wolf Elves around.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon smiles a little, “You’ll like our countermeasures, I think.”</p>

    <h2 id="2">Bryti and First</h2>
    <p>After the general ruckus has calmed down, and it seems apparent that no more errant spell slinging was going to occur, The First finally emerges from the table he was crouched behind.  Scanning the plaza, he notices that the Seeker is currently generally unengaged… and for reasons known only to him, opts to approach with a small frown(or maybe rbf) on his face.  </p>
    <p>Once there, he just kind of stands to the side of her… then clears his throat, noisily.</p>
    <p>Bryti flicks an ear, then turns her head towards him slowly.</p>
    <p>"Yes?” She asks in a weary voice. </p>
    <p>“Sooo…,” he begins, really drawing the word out.  “...just for my own notes… did you even consider using the potion I gave you?”</p>
    <p>“What, against Echo?” She asks, “No. I <i>wanted</i> him to see me. I was not about to run. I will note that I do appreciate the potion. It will come in handy the next time someone sends a full military division after me.” </p>
    <p>“No, not against <i>Echo</i>,” he says, exasperated. Then, he gets a thoughtful look on his face.  “Although, thinking of…” he leans in a little, and asks in a low voice, “...did you kill him?”</p>
    <p>Bryti blinks at him, then barks a laugh.</p>
    <p>“No,” she answers, “That would have taken <i>considerably</i> more time. No, to my surprise, we ended up talking it out.” </p>
    <p>The First gives her a deadpan stare.  Then he sighs, explosively.  “No, of <i>course</i> not.  Why should fate do me any favors…” He frowns dramatically.</p>
    <p>“Speaking of…” Bryti gives him a look, “He had some choice things to say about you. <i>Did</i> you have a list? During the Blight?” </p>
    <p>The First blanches.  He looks away.  “Oh… lots.  Dozens.  Maybe even hundreds.  There was a lot to track, you see, it was <i>kind of</i> a big deal,” he dissembles.</p>
    <p>Bryti leans towards him slightly, causing the chair to creak.</p>
    <p>“You know not to lie to me, First,” she states. </p>
    <p>His lips tighten into a line.  “Yes.  Of course not.  So, I haven’t,” he says, technically correct.</p>
    <p>“You also <i>definitely</i> know what I’m talking about,” she continues. </p>
    <p>“Okay, yes, <i>Fine</i>, I know what you’re insinuating!  I’m certain he told you all sorts of things, the callous sneer I wore, the gleeful glint in my eye as I presented it! I’m surprised you could translate so much from <i>grunts</i> and <i>inarticulate screams</i>!”  He seems somewhat defensive.</p>
    <p>“He did mention that, yes,” Bryti leans back, relenting her looming, “Very similar wording. I see no callous sneer, though.” </p>
    <p>“Well, <i>what of it?</i>  I did what I had to do! What the ignorant fumbling of the others left me no <i>option</i> but to do!  And after agonizing nights of trying to do everything I could to mitigate it, I tried to float it as an <i>option</i>, and he throttles me, calls me… <i>me…</i> ignorant of options, and then goes and burns down half a forest and an entire squad to try and… and…”  He runs out of steam, just ending in a frustrated huff.</p>
    <p>“And?” Bryti asks, “Not a trick. I didn’t get enough out of him to learn what actually happened.” </p>
    <p>“... well, it certainly wasn’t <i>palatable.</i>  And we had to stew half of it until it all turned the same color just to make sure it was safe to eat.  But… it… tided things over.  At least, until the Potatoes arrived.” What… what even is that pronunciation.</p>
    <p>“I see,” Bryti tenses, “I… witnessed much starvation in the wake of the collapse. It hit the remote villages the worst. You were not the only ones forced to… to resort to such extreme measures. I cannot imagine what going through that was like, much less with… people you might have known.” </p>
    <p>The First is quiet, for once.  He just stares off into the distance.  “...It didn’t come to that.  Given how swiftly The Layer managed to secure the relief rations, it absolutely would not have come to the worst case scenario.  I had… prepared <i>everything</i>, just so, to account for any windfall.  It… wasn’t easy, no.  But I did it.  It was my <i>Responsibility.</i>”  He grinds out the last word bitterly.</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Bryti breathes out, “The way he phrased it I thought… Oh. That… is a significant relief.”</p>
    <p>She is also quiet, considering First’s words.</p>
    <p>“He also used that word a lot, Responsibility,” she says, “Spoken in the same manner.” </p>
    <p>First scoffs.  “Well, of course he did.  Likely, it’s the biggest word he knows.  Though I question his particular definition of it.  For most Crag, it is the foundational concept behind our society, the quasi-sacred bond that we all adhere to to see that our people flourish and prosper, with each doing their utmost to propel us into a brighter future.”  He makes a sarcastic, noncommittal gesture. “To him, it’s something more like ‘Fuck you, I do what I want.’ “ He grinds his teeth. </p>
    <p>Bryti rubs her forehead briefly.</p>
    <p>“To be a Crag…” She takes a moment to remember the words, despite the mild concussion, “Is to serve the Crag. To strive for them. To bleed for them. Quite a ways off from ‘Fuck you, I do what I want’ if I may add my commentary.” </p>
    <p>Regardless of how terrible an idea it is, The First gives her a fierce glare.  “Oh, so dutiful scholars cannot lie to you, but blood-drunk madmen get a pass?”</p>
    <p>“I will note we were already punching each other in the head,” she gives him a flat look as his glare deflects off harmlessly, “But no, he was not lying. Rageful and violent though he may be, that’s what he really believes.” </p>
    <p>The First’s glare slackens, losing power as he realizes it has no, or perhaps even the opposite, effect.  “Well,” he finally manages, petulantly, “If so, then he has a curious methodology for demonstrating it.”  He rubs at his arm.  </p>
    <p>“ANYways,” he says with finality, “since you haven’t done me any good turns in that department, then I suppose I only owe you a single word of Thanks.  Brace yourself.  ‘Thanks.’” He gets this smug look.</p>
    <p>Bryti nods at him seriously.</p>
    <p>“I appreciate the gesture,” she declares, “I understand how meaningful it is when coming from one with such challenges as yourself.” </p>
    <p>He nods along, having mastered the gesture… but then slows, actually thinking about her words.  “Wait.  Challenges?  What Challenges?”  He actually slaps his hands on the table, leaning in closer.  “<i>What have you heard?</i>” he hisses.</p>
    <p>Bryti waves a hand.</p>
    <p>“Don’t worry,” she says quietly “I will not tell anyone your secrets.” </p>
    <p>“<i>Which</i> sec-”, he almost blurts, but seems to remember that he’s actually in a somewhat populated area.  Where some people are looking at him.  Probably, for openly conversing with a werewolf.  He clears his throat.</p>
    <p>“...Yes.  That’s probably for the best.  It is all well in hand, anyway.”</p>
    <p>"That's inspiring to hear," Bryti bobs her head in a somewhat odd gesture, "I am glad to know you are overcoming your special difficulties." </p>
    <p>The First seethes at that, but before launching into some indignant tirade, he seems to have a moment of realization.  With no further explanation, he points his index finger into Bryti’s face… and then moves it left and right.</p>
    <p>Bryti tracks his finger. Sort of. She maybe goes a little bit crosseyed.</p>
    <p>“Since when did you learn sleight of hand?” She comments. </p>
    <p>The First’s expression drops.  “...Seriously?  <i>Seriously?</i>  You are <i>literally</i> Headdam! Thorny devils drag me to the eighth hell for salacious purposes, you were going to try and take on Ancestors only know how many Wolves were surrounding the place with a <i>skull</i> full of <i>scrambled eggs?</i>” </p>
    <p>Though he sounds huffy, his expression reveals legitimate concern.  He casts his eyes about the plaza, unfortunately finding that there are a number of other Crag watching him… but makes up his mind, a determined sneer crossing his face.</p>
    <p>He rummages around in his robes, producing numerous small vials and small pouches that he mixes together with practiced efficiency. One by one, exactly 6 seconds apart, he slaps down 3 vials; one full of a green, viscous liquid, the next with a pink tinged gel with little sparkly bits, and lastly a vibrant orange solution.</p>
    <p>“Drink,” he dictates, “Left to right.  Hopefully there’s something to salvage in there.” His general irascible tone can’t quite hide the concern in his voice.</p>
    <p>"Oh," Bryti comments as she lightly touches her bruised forehead and slowly pronounces the condition in draconic, "<i>Commotio cerebi.</i> I should have thought of that. Perhaps I should not have intercepted so many of his blows with my face."</p>
    <p>Bryti carefully counts the vials once, ensures she's counting left to right twice, then swiftly downs the bottles one by one. </p>
    <p>As she does, The First lists off an explanation.  “That one should help with the throbbing… that one, with the damage… and <i>that</i> one should keep you alert.  Sleeping while Headdam is <i>super bad</i> for you.  I don’t doubt that your innate resilience should handle the rest after that.  Maybe you’ll even recover enough grey matter to perhaps consider the <i>odds</i> against you the next time you spot some form of… <i>predicament.</i>” </p>
    <p>Bryti's pupils contract, then dilate as she imbibes the concoctions. She looks down at the bottles, then her still fuzzy hands. She then looks to the hole in the wall, and finally to the crag still cowering from her presence.</p>
    <p>"First, I am aware that I lack a great deal of knowledge about crag culture so please correct me if I am wrong," she speaks calmly, "but I believe I may be committing several forms of impropriety." </p>
    <p>The First blinks at her.  He seems at a loss for words.  Finally, he manages.  “...Yes.  Are committing.  Have committed.  Will Commit.  And, at some unknown time, will have been committing, making a pluperfect mess of things.  But <i>hopefully,</i> we can move past some of that.  But for now…”  He glances about.  “It will probably be best if you were to recuperate in one of the hopefully-still-lovely lodgings The Layer created for you Lowlanders.  At the very least, not having you out in the open will let the rest of us start… cleaning.” He stares over at the cadaver still gently cooling in the plaza. Bryti follows his gaze.</p>
    <p>“Now, <i>that</i> one wasn’t my fault,” she says defensively.</p>
    <p>She grips the table briefly and shifts to her elf form. It seems to take a good deal of effort and leaves her out of breath for a few seconds.</p>
    <p>“Though you are correct. A little time to recover would do me well,” she looks around again, “The fact that it’s available at all is heartening.” </p>
    <p>Though few of the common Crag around the plaza seem ready to leave their hiding spots, The First, at least, seems partially relieved.</p>
    <p>“I’m certain you can find lodgings to your own preference.  Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to figure out where one of my Scholars got off to…”</p>
    <p>With that, the rest of the bewildered crag are left to try to determine why, exactly, their First among Scholars just had a conversation with a werewolf, what potions he gave her, and how in the world he wasn’t strangled by her.  </p>
    <p>Rumors have gotten out of hand in record time.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h2 id="3">Fury, Vesnia, and Lucinia</h2>
    <p>A few days have passed since the potluck itself. To most people's disbelief, Vesnia and Embebi's mission seems to have been a success. Some of the scouts are prisoners, but others have decided they'd rather join with Vesnia.</p>
    <p>It's an awkward truce, punctuated by Athlon events. No one fully trusts Vesnia. She meant the words she said, and her motives for betraying her superiors are still suspect. Still, there is no immediate threat of violence from her towards the other elves. With an official invitation, Vesnia and her small group have taken up residence in one of the guest buildings specifically created for this event.</p>
    <p>This is the building that Fury finds herself approaching, with Lucinia attached to her hip as usual. With the other wolf elves moving about the settlement in brazen furriness, Lucinia has dropped her disguise and shows her real face.</p>
    <p>A face that is currently watching the door of the low stone building in front of them with deep concern. </p>
    <p>Fury tucks her wings awkwardly behind her, leaving a few pseudo-feathers dragging sparks along the ground. “We’re not going inside,” she says, giving Lucinia a brief smile. “But I have some questions, and if Vesnia will answer them, all three of us will be better off.”</p>
    <p>Lucinia looks to Fury's wings, then back to her. She quietly nods. </p>
    <p>Fury knocks. </p>
    <p>There is a slight pause before the door opens. Vesnia stands in the doorway. She is wearing crag-style clothing instead of her former military uniform. Though there are dark circles under her eyes, she is still standing straight. When she sees the Fury she steps out of the doorway and stands at military attention, though she does not salute.</p>
    <p>"Fury," Vesnia states cooly, "State your business." </p>
    <p>“If you have a few minutes, we have some questions,” Fury says. She gestures over to a set of carved benches, set in the stonework in front of the Wolf Elf residence. “I thought we could have a chat out here on the patio, since it's such a nice day.”</p>
    <p>Vesnia rubs the bridge of her nose slightly. She closes the door behind her.</p>
    <p>"Very well," she states in the same coldly professional manner, "Lead on." </p>
    <p>Fury walks over to a set of benches about a hundred paces from the residences, and drops neatly onto one of them. Lucinia sits down beside her.</p>
    <p>Vesnia scans the benches. Noting that Fury has selected a seating location that does not allow her to sit directly opposite the fire elf leader, she instead selects the one next to her. Vesnia sits stiffly and does not lean back.</p>
    <p>"You aren't here for a polite chat," Vesnia states, "What do you want?" </p>
    <p>“I <i>am</i> here for a polite chat,” Fury says, rolling her eyes. “I’m just taking precautions, the same as you would. And I was hoping you’d be willing to share a little bit of information. Let’s start with something obvious  -- I want your assurances that you and your comrades won’t go after Lucinia while we’re here. Or at any future Potluck you attend, preferably.”</p>
    <p>"What would I do, tattle on her to Faustus?" Vesnia laughs humourlessly, "No. I have no reason to harm her now, and neither do my men. We are all traitors here." </p>
    <p>"Matter of opinion there," Fury says, "but I'll take your word all the same. Especially since I'm guessing the other Wolf Elves would treat you and your comrades the same way they'd treat her. So… the civilians. Can you tell me what's being done with them? Or 'to'?"</p>
    <p>"The winged elf was right," Vesnia's voice is matter of fact but she can't quite seem to meet Fury's eyes, "The captives are being forcibly conscripted. Those suitable become wolf elves. Those not, or who have other valuable abilities, are intentionally afflicted. Once so, they have little choice but to serve us- serve <i>them.</i> No one else would let them live. It's an effective motivation, even when the affliction twists one's mind."</p>
    <p>Fury sighs. "I was afraid of that. 'Elven Unity for everyone but those who disagree with us', huh?" She pauses. "I apologize. That was rude of me."</p>
    <p>"Not particularly," Vesnia says, "What other questions do you have?" </p>
    <p>"What happened to the spy who escaped? The one we nicknamed 'Rasa'?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know," Vesnia sighs, "We keep-  <i>they</i> keep <i>their</i> intelligence assets as compartmentalized as possible, to prevent scenarios such as the one happening here. I only know as much as I do because I was preparing to argue the merit of… our actions to the crag." </p>
    <p>"Which whoever's in charge wasn't interested in, because it would mean sharing power," Fury says.</p>
    <p>"In a sense," Vesnia thinks for a moment, "He would rather have compliance than a massacre. I was able to argue that the crag might serve as a unique sect, a knowledge base upon which to continue his exploration of elven flexibility. The issue was moreso that he is impatient. He wanted concrete results, not vague promises. He sees knowledge as a resource to be extracted, and he has a time table. You are correct, though. He sees himself as absolute authority." </p>
    <p>“Right,” Fury said. “This ‘Ýtersto’. What do you mean by ‘exploring elven flexibility’?” </p>
    <p>Vesnia gets a distant look, as if reciting something from memory.</p>
    <p>"The humans, the hobgoblins, the dwarves…" She mimics a masculine voice with a familiar accent, "They will all outbreed us. They will always outnumber us. To overcome them, we elves must use our greatest strength: the adaptable power of our blood. Every environment, every magic, can be made a part of us. We must adapt to every extreme, to every enemy, we must take every advantage we can gain to be greater than our enemies." </p>
    <p>“He sounds like quite a piece of work,” Fury says, in the same accent. Her accent. </p>
    <p>"When was he not?" Vesnia replies. </p>
    <p>Fury cocks her head. “...You must have known him for a long time, then. I’ll admit, I don’t know much about ‘Lord Ýtersto’ -- just what little intel we have.”</p>
    <p>"You don't?" Vesnia gives her a quizzical look, "That's odd. Despite the name change, it is not difficult to figure out. His personality is as overbearing as it was in Muspelham, and I have a hard time imagining someone with a courtier's accent wouldn't have met Goldheart at least once. I met him, and I was a soldier." </p>
    <p>Fury rolls her eyes. “He’s not Faustus Goldheart.”</p>
    <p>"He is," Vesnia speaks cautiously, "I have met him, before and after. He is difficult to forget." </p>
    <p>Lucinia quietly scoots a few inches away from Fury.</p>
    <p>“Then he’s awfully chatty for a dead person,” Fury says, ignoring the sizzle on her fingertips where her hand touches the stone bench.</p>
    <p>Vesnia glances at Fury's hands.</p>
    <p>"I wasn't there," She speaks in a level voice, "I was deployed when the conflagration happened. I do not know how he survived or why he isn't a fire elf, but he is definitely Faustus Goldheart, whether you want him to be or not." </p>
    <p>“Are you sure? Has anyone actually checked?” Fury says hotly. “Maybe you all were just talking to a charred skeleton.” </p>
    <p>"Yes," Vesnia answers with equal measures of confidence and annoyance, "And unless you really are the vapid child he claims you to be, you will <i>accept</i> that. Ýtersto is Goldheart." </p>
    <p>“Oooh, <i>vapid child</i>,” Fury says. “If that’s all he’s got, I <i>must</i> be right. He’s a brain-dead, bloated corpse, playing on his little throne again while kissing the paws of whoever his master is <i>this time</i>. He can’t even come up with new insults himself; someone else has to give him them.” She stands up. “For obvious reasons, Vesnia, I hope you never run into him again. But if you do, tell him he’ll wish he stayed dead, because next time I kill him I won’t be nearly so nice. Come on, Lucinia.” She starts walking away from the Wolf Elf housing area, and back towards the guest quarters closer to the entranceway. </p>
    <p>Lucinia pokes her head out from under the singed bench, then hops back up to standing and follows Fury. Vesnia resumes breathing from where she has plastered herself on the far side of her seat away from Fury.</p>
    <p>"I…" Vesnia clears her throat, "I'll do that."</p>

    <h2 id="5">Old Coot Convention</h2>
    <p>As it has been since the days of old, wherever there are young children, there are old people to dote on them.  So it was, and so it shall be, and so it is right now as the various honored elders of the Elven peoples gather to appreciate the dawning of a new generation. Baijani, the proud but tired grandmother, is thoroughly enjoying the break while other people do some of the work. And it’s just so damn cute to watch.</p>
    <p>One of the tiny nuggets has been absconded with by the tall, ancient dark elf.  He seems to be cooing at the baby in his arms, but not at a level easily heard by those around him.  Rasputin might also be speaking to the child in a different language.  It is really hard to tell sometimes.</p>
    <p>Conspicuously absent from this gaggle, however, has been one intensely old elf… but it looks like that is about to change, as The Esteemed gently guides her ox towards the cluster.  Stopping short of entering the circle, she keeps a polite distance, but seems to be interested primarily to speaking with Ehra.”</p>
    <p>“Greetings to you, Grandmaster, Chief among the Blades.”</p>
    <p> However, even the Crag know to respect the timeless ritual being conducted here, and so she is willing to wait until she is acknowledged. Ehra gently passes a wiggling baby to the next in line and turns to the Esteemed with a bow.</p>
    <p>"And greetings to you as well, Esteemed Elpahka. I have to say, this has been an exciting event," he says so with a smile. </p>
    <p>The Esteemed frowns quickly, before returning to a neutral expression.  “Regrettably so.  While I cannot say that I expected this event to function as… optimistically as some suggested, I had hoped that it would have been more orderly than this.  I hope there is nothing that has caused you anguish.”</p>
    <p>"Anguish?" Ehra's voice is still cheerful, "Most certainly not. No, especially now I can see the great challenges you faced in making this happen… and challenges provided by those who attended. I also have hope that though a great deal of chaos happened here, from it we will be able to produce a great deal of good." </p>
    <p>The Esteemed gives a small smile.  “That is as we must always hope for, that, gods willing, the trials of the present may lead us to prosper in the future.  Which is, by chance, why I wished to speak to you.”</p>
    <p>She sits up a little straighter, eyes open wide as she looks at Ehra, brandishing all the dignity she can muster.</p>
    <p>“Grandmaster of the Blades, I have heard from my people the role you played in one of our darkest hours; The Layer of the Path, whom you may know as Slabal, was quite clear on the matter.  Were it not for your timely intercession, the future of the Crag may have been placed in jeopardy.  While I am aware that, nominally, a transfer of goods was already satisfied, I can also recognize that while we gave you iron, you gave us lives.  I recognize that, in full balance, this exchange still leaves us indebted to your people.  I hope that, some day, we may find a proper repayment.”</p>
    <p>“Iron is life to us, in a fashion,” Ehra says with a little more seriousness, “But… that is not the point. I  didn’t arrange such a trade expecting a perfectly balanced scale. I didn’t expect to call in a debt marker, or position myself for a position of strength. If there is such a debt, such an imbalance… my hope is that it will be balanced not by iron, but with goodwill. The extra value I hoped to achieve was finding a friend in a time when we have precious few, Esteemed.” </p>
    <p>The Esteemed raises an eyebrow, looking pointedly at the definitely-not-sword-elf-infant that Ehra was just permitted to handle.  “It seems in my estimation, Grandmaster, that you are unlikely to find yourself in such a position with what time you have to spend on this world.  But let me assure you: I am not speaking to you as The Layer would, concerned explicitly with remuneration and exchange.  Rather, I wish to express to you that the Crag people owe to your people a concrete return on your timely deliverance… to speak in the common terms of my youth, a ‘solid’.”  She seems bemused.</p>
    <p>“A ‘solid’ then?” Ehra actually grins at that, “Well that, I think, is exactly the kind of arrangement we were hoping for.” </p>
    <p>The Esteemed makes a small affirmative gesture.  “Just so.  Should you ever wish to collect on it, I understand that there are now means to directly communicate that desire to us… means that I am now regularly made aware of.” Her words carry a hint of pique.  She scans the area for The First, to glare at him… but, for the moment, he is nowhere to be seen. </p>
    <p>Baijani gets up from the bench she’s been sitting on, gently bouncing the baby. She peers up at the Esteemed, “Seems like those kind of ties are going to be even more important in the coming seasons. With business out of the way, would you like to join us in complaining about young people?” She glances down at the baby, “Not these two though. Mostly.” After readjusting the colorful woven blanket, she holds out the bundle to the other woman. </p>
    <p>The Esteemed raises her eyebrow again.  “How do you mean?” She asks, sounding… intrigued.</p>
    <p>“Just the usual, young people and all their energy, fond reminiscing of our own youth, comparing the sage wisdom we’ve gained over the centuries.” She grins a bit, “Is that not a pastime for elderly Crag?” </p>
    <p>The Esteemed makes a small affirmative gesture.  “Ah, yes.  It is a common thing to share wisdom… and ‘wisdom’,” she says in a knowing tone.  “Although… I have not had much experience in the practice.  The duties of the Esteemed does require a degree of… freedom from distraction, so as best to understand and interpret the needs of the Crag people.”  There is no sadness to the fact, just a simple statement of truth. </p>
    <p>“Your time belongs to the people you lead, not yourself,” Baijani says with a nod, still offering the baby. He makes small grabbing motions toward the Esteemed and babbles what could almost be mistaken for real words. “But surely they can spare you a few minutes?” </p>
    <p>If The Esteemed understands that Baijani is offering the baby to her, she shows no indication of it.  Uncertainly, she examines the infant.  “While that may be the case, it would be a poor example to make.  Er, yes.  Your people have done well for themselves; your Next Generation seems hale and hearty.  I can only hope that ours will prosper as well when the time comes.” </p>
    <p>“Would you like to hold him?” Baijani asks gently, fighting back a smile. </p>
    <p>A startled expression leaps to The Esteemed’s features.  This is evidently not a question she ever expected to hear.  Slightly flustered, she looks away from the child, opting to look Baijani in the eyes.</p>
    <p>“I… do not think that wise.  It has been many centuries since I was last entrusted to act as Cladekeeper… and… my strength is not what it used to be.  To tell a full truth, it is not what it used to be when I first uttered that it was not what it used to be.”  She doesn’t exaggerate much… while not necessarily frail, her arms do seem to be extremely thin.</p>
    <p>“But perhaps,” she says placatingly, “You do utter a truth.  Especially for this day, and what it is meant to represent, I could… stay a while.  To listen. To learn. And… to reflect,” she slowly reaches out, and runs thin, knobbly fingers gently across the baby’s scalp, “on the future.” </p>
