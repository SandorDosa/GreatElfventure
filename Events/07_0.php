    <h1>A Potluck Disassembled</h1>
    <p>War is terrible for party planning. Those pesky wolf elves have gone and started a major continent spanning conflict that just makes all those RSVPs useless. It’s no matter, though. The elves won’t forget this holiday, and will be celebrating in their own ways.</p>
    <p>This potluck will focus on these groups of elves, their struggles, and what they are planning for the new year to come. As bits and pieces, it will be a collection of smaller scenes. Like bits and pieces, we will start each scene on a fresh page with a header and a line of links here, on the front page.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, here’s a brief rundown of which characters are where-</p>
    <p><a href="#Surt">Surt</a> - The Triumvirate, Allophryne, Barrabus, Ink, Skulk, Echo, Trischal, Jarn, Veth, various wolf elves, Blinkin, Fuzzy</p>
    <p><a href="#Amie Navire">Amie Navire</a> - Prosalirus, Litoria, Smilisca, Bryti, Ehra, Siiri, Katiin, Smoke, Embebi, Amenidal, Sauver, ...and Voyager.</p>
    <p><a href="#Hilt'Inn">Hilt’Inn</a> - Shadi (and assorted unnamed flappies), Grit (and assorted dreamdust elves), Shy, Vahn, Greg/Rasputin, Kolya</p>

    <p>“You’ve seriously never had mead?” Tallflower says to Veth, straining to shove another heavy crate out of the large storage room behind <i>the Howl’s</i> kitchen. “It was practically the Empire’s state drink, back in the day. Even the seedy bars had some -- and trust me, I know, because Barry and I drank in them. See if you can get that last box, please.” </p>
    <p>“Yeah, the seedy bars <i>had</i> it,” Veth easily lifts the crate without much effort, “And charged you out the ass for it! Plus, I had been kicked out of… like… everywhere by the time I was ninety, and anywhere that hadn’t kicked me out knew I was under age. I didn’t have the coin for mead, it was watered down ale or nothing, and that was a treat.” </p>
    <p>“I think I have a bottle of <i>Leafstorm Special</i> in the kitchen,” Tallflower says. “<small>...At least I think it’s his, and not more ghoul mead…</small> You should try it. I’ll break out the bottle once the ‘despots’ get here.” He grabs a spare wooden table, currently leaning against the wall, and carefully sets it onto the floor, revealing a complicated sketch burned into the wall -- a landscape of Surt, seen from outside of the city, with portraits of the Triumvirate set above it.</p>
    <p>“Had a sketcher come by and draw this in a few weeks ago,” Tallflower says, hands on his hips. “Looks good, right?”</p>
    <p>“Hm,” Veth puts the crate she’s carrying down and looks it over, “Kinda boring.” </p>
    <p>“Oh yeah?” Tallflower says. “What would you’ve put on it, then? And don’t say Barry. I see his mug enough, thanks.”</p>
    <p>“I was kinda thinking it could use more ti-”</p>
    <p>There is a knock at the back door -- the first few seconds of <i>the Ballad of Barrabus Leafstorm</i>, in swift staccato.</p>
    <p>“That should be Barry,” Tallflower says. He glances at Veth. “Stay back here, just in case.”</p>
    <p>Veth picks up and generally waves a table leg in a gesture of solidarity and thuggery. </p>
    <p>Tallflower steps up to the back door, taps out the next stanza of <i>the Ballad</i>, waits for a response, and then pops the door open, revealing Barry and three figures in masks and cloaks.</p>
    <p>Terror is the first through the door, pulling back her cloak as she steps in, and revealing her mask, armor, and the hammer strapped onto her back. She pulls a clay amphora from her belt, and hands it over to Tallflower. “Anyone else here?” she says.</p>
    <p>“Veth, your gra-- your em-- sir,” Tallflower says nervously. “Welcome to <i>the Howl</i>!”</p>
    <p>“Oh really?” Fury says, stepping in behind Terror. “Barry’s girlfriend? I’ve been so looking forward to meeting her!” She darts past Terror and Tallflower, and dashes straight for the storage room door.</p>
    <p>“She’s not--” Barry says, trailing after her.</p>
    <p>“So I don’t need to club anyo- oh hey,” Veth leans around the door, “Uh, hi there, your… tri… ness?” </p>
    <p>“You must be Veth!” Fury says, smiling. She tucks the tray she’s carrying under an arm, and offers Veth a handshake. “It’s so wonderful to meet you! Allophryne’s told me so much about how you’ve helped us!”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, uh, that’s me, just Veth…” Veth nervously takes Fury’s hand and shakes it as if she were holding a glass snowflake, “You um… you haven’t read my book, right?” </p>
    <p>“You wrote a book?” Fury asks. “Allophryne hadn’t mentioned… We’ve been so busy, it must have just slipped his mind.” She pauses. “Would you like some plakouscake? I managed to track down Ruber Herringbone -- he’s one of the city’s best bakers -- and he was willing to make one for us. I thought it would be a good way to provide some… normalcy for this potluck. Plus, cake!”</p>
    <p>“The ‘package’ is still secure in his room?” Terror says to Tallflower, as the innkeeper re-locks the heavy back door.</p>
    <p>“Are you planning on keeping Echo locked away for the entirety of the potluck?” Hunger asks. “Not that I blame you personally; I’m curious.”</p>
    <p>Terror sighs. “He’s invited; I would just prefer to keep his presence in the city quiet for a little while longer.”</p>
    <p>Hunger nods. “Another surprise for our invasive host,” he says. “Fine, fine.”</p>
    <p>Veth exhales slightly, glances between the trio of triumvirati, then banks that they might be busy with Tallflower and starts gently sidling somewhere less noticeable. She gets a few steps before her eyes center on the cake.</p>
    <p>“I… haven’t eaten anything other than… scavenged food or wolf elf rations in years,” she says quietly, “And before that, not much better…” </p>
    <p>“Luci was the same way,” Fury says, nodding. “And Faustus always was a greedy bastard when it came to desserts. Come on; you can have as much as you want.” She sweeps past Veth, and sets the cake onto the table in the center of the storage room. “Any sign of Skulk? ...Wait. Why am I asking that? Hi, Skulk!”</p>
    <p>“<i>Bitch</i>,” Skulk chuckles as she lounges on a nearby broken couch, “How’d you know?”</p>
    <p>“Parties are just more interesting when you’re around,” Fury says smoothly. “How is your brother?”</p>
    <p>“He’s all fluttery when he’s going somewhere you’re gonna be,” Skulk waves a hand, “Don’t worry, he’ll be here.” </p>
    <p>A slight glow makes its way up Fury’s cheeks. “That’s so adorable of him,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Yes, please, let’s give our most powerful mage ‘butterflies in his stomach,’ ” Hunger says, carrying a tray of spiced meats and honey over to the table. “Drive him to distraction while we fight for our lives. Very clever plan.”</p>
    <p>Fury makes a face. “Up there with ‘ambushing Faustus at our own rally’?”</p>
    <p>“That was your plan as well, if I recall,” Hunger says. “And it worked quite well, thank you.” He gives Veth a calculating glance, and then sets the tray down beside the cake. “You must be Veth.” </p>
    <p>"Yeth," Veth says through a mouthful of cake. She hastily swallows and dusts the crumbs off her hand, offering the mildly sticky appendage to Hunger, "That's me." </p>
    <p>Hunger takes it, thankful as usual that his mask hides his expressions, and that he has a bottle of aether to clean his hand with afterwards. “This might seem a strange question… when you were afflicted, did the afflicted version of yourself ever… argue with you?”</p>
    <p>"Actually… yeah," Veth says quietly, "Well… sort of. It's… hard to describe. I put different pieces of myself in different places, I guess…" </p>
    <p>“Different pieces…” Hunger says. He pulls a stylus and a small wad of parchment from a pocket inside his chiton. “Curious. Which pieces?”</p>
    <p>"I'm sure I'm a real interesting experiment for you," Veth glances at the page, "But I'm not looking to get dissected." </p>
    <p>Hunger sighs. “I apologize,” he says. He waves the wad of parchment. “Merely some notes on the experiences of someone else who was previously afflicted. Leafstorm provided me with a brief description of your experience, and I’m afraid my curiosity got the better of me.”</p>
    <p>"Wait, you actually were afflicted?" Veth raises both eyebrows, "I thought that was just propaganda. You got cured?" </p>
    <p>Hunger sighs again -- this time with significantly more grumpiness. “I had <i>hoped</i> that Cantia and Goldheart would still be keeping that a <i>secret</i>, in the hopes of using that against us. I worked quite hard to give them the impression that I am still afflicted.”</p>
    <p>"Yeah, they told us you were afflicted still," Veth takes a few steps over and sits on what appears to be an ugly green leather couch, "That Cantia <i>graciously</i> offered you her 'cure,' but you had already given in to the madness and rejected it, so obviously we were doing your people a favor by removing their insane leader. Ugh. I thought it was all bullshit." </p>
    <p>“Of course. The ‘insane leader, who gave into the madness, yet is still able to keep that a secret and somehow keep a city functioning and stable.’ “ The mask might hide it, but there’s a clear smirk in the Hunger’s tone. He gives the far end of the green ‘couch’ a pat. “Dear Cantia has probably deduced by now that I am cured -- thanks to the Tourist. And Blinkin, too,” he adds quickly, as the couch shifts under his hand. “But I had hoped to keep her guessing for a little bit longer.”</p>
    <p>“Beats me,” Veth shrugs as she munches a bit more cake, “Allophryne told me he’d help cure someone, didn’t know it was you. Did you… how long were you afflicted?” </p>
    <p>“Two years,” Hunger says.</p>
    <p>“A bit over a year and a half,” Veth’s voice drops as she looks around the room, “How do you handle it? What you did… during?” </p>
    <p>“Wasted a significant amount of time trying to develop my own cure,” Hunger sighs, setting himself onto the end of the couch. “Spent a tremendous amount of effort arguing with myself. Built a cage to hold afflicted-me inside my lab. Nearly took the cure Cantia provided when she discovered her ‘assassination’ attempt had succeded, and then refused when I realized the damned version of myself the affliction had created was my worst, most craven aspects crammed together. Pretending to be ‘me’ like a damned doppleganger, with no real sense of who ‘I’ am. And then… went to a Potluck, to die.”</p>
    <p>“Did you kill anyone?” Veth asks in a tense voice. </p>
    <p>“Not that I’m aware of,” Hunger says cautiously. “But the ‘dog’ was a coward. He had plenty of opportunity, but was more interested in continuing my research than immediate violence. I have no doubt he would have, if given the opportunity, but the risk of being discovered -- or of me simply downing a bottle of aqua regia when I next took control -- was significant enough that he didn’t risk it. That, and his plans were much more of the ‘manipulate the city for self-benefit’ than ‘wanton violence’ variety.”</p>
    <p>“So you never gave in,” Veth doesn’t look him in the eyes, “Never gave up, all the way. I… I did. They kept us from killing ourselves so we couldn’t escape. And… they… had us kill. In training. The ones who were too mad to control, or who resisted too well. They had us kill them to make sure we would follow orders. I gave in. Gave up. Killed them so they wouldn’t kill me. I was what they made me, what <i>it</i> made me… and… and I <i>enjoyed</i> it. Even when we attacked Surt. I killed innocent people, people who didn’t deserve it and I <i>enjoyed</i> it.”</p>
    <p>“I know it was the affliction making me do it,” Veth breathes out hard, “But I still <i>did</i> it, I still remember it. I don’t… I don’t know  how to deal with it.” </p>
    <p>“...I don’t have a good answer for you,” Hunger says. “Bearing the burden of past crimes properly or sensibly has… never really been my forte. All I can promise you is that you’re not alone on this, and that there’s not a person in Surt who hasn’t done something terrible that they regret. The fact that you recognize it and want to make amends, if you can, is important, and proves you stronger than most. And that redemption is at least still out there for you.” He pauses. “And if it helps, I did give in, shortly before the Potluck. I almost accepted Cantia’s cure.” </p>
    <p>"Almost…" Veth says, "But you didn't. I'll answer your question, just… promise not to laugh at me, okay?" </p>
    <p>“On my honor as an alchemist,” Hunger says.</p>
    <p>"Right…" Veth gives him a critical look, "'Cuz if you do I'll slug you. Anyway… I was writing a story, right? And there was this character in it who I was writing as a hero. A lot of it was just in my head, but I kept thinking about it. She was afflicted too, and I guess I was using her to fantasize about what I really wanted to do, and I sort of… hid good parts of me in her. I hid it so deep I didn't even realize I was doing it. I guess hiding it from myself hid it from the affliction too, and in the end I realized I… had to let go of me, not her. I dunno. It's hard to describe. I let go of what I am and saved what I can be. It was enough."</p>
    <p>“You saved the better parts of yourself, even at the cost of who you were,” Hunger says. “That, I can definitely understand.” He taps his mask thoughtfully. </p>
    <p>"You know what I did during the conflagration?" Veth asks. </p>
    <p>“It can’t be much worse than what I did,” Hunger says, “but go ahead.”</p>
    <p>"Nothing," Veth says, "I did nothing. I don't want to do nothing again." </p>
    <p>“And I put on a mask, to bury an elf,” Hunger says. “...The ‘dog’ was a bit closer to who I was before the Conflagration than I care to admit. Perhaps that was the reason I was able to resist -- I had already tried to kill it once.” He shakes his head. “But dwelling on old failures rarely leads to new success, and it hardly sounds like you’re doing ‘nothing’ now. Leafstorm is under the impression that you’re doing quite a bit, in fact. And if you can motivate him into doing something, I’ll be quite impressed.”</p>
    <p>"We're trying to convince the other burning wolves that they can be cured," Veth explains, "But it's going pretty rough. The cryptids snuck me into the barracks on a full moon so I can prove I'm cured, but… they tried to kill me. Almost did. I'm lucky I'm not afflicted again…" </p>
    <p>Hunger nods. “And, from the reports I’ve read, scared Faustus enough to make them consider you a serious target. They may have tried to kill you, but it seems as if they also got your message.” </p>
    <p>"I'm going back," Veth says, "I'm not giving up. I have to." </p>
    <p>“Then you’ll need an edge,” Hunger says. “And perhaps something that will help them listen to you.”</p>
    <p>"I'm open to ideas," Veth sighs, "I'm scared shitless." </p>
    <p>“To start with, I can provide the same elixirs the Wolf Elves are providing to help control the effects,” he says. “I was able to reverse-engineer their recipe. If I can organize a few of my associates to assist, we should be able to produce quite a lot of it. Beyond that… I have a few ideas, but they’ll need testing first.”</p>
    <p>"Think you could teach me some alchemy maybe?" Veth perks up a bit, "Maybe I could help make some. Or just alchemist fire. I love alchemist fire." </p>
    <p>“If you want, certainly,” the Hunger says. “And good choice. Alchemist fire is a good place to start -- simple ingredients, somewhat flexible, and slightly dangerous.” </p>
    <p>"Ooh, awesome," Veth grins, "Look… if you got any other clever schemes or whatever, I'm all ears. I'm going all in on this. Anything might help…"</p>
    <p>“Let me see what I can come up with,” Hunger says. </p>
    <p>The door leading from the main hall to the kitchen slides open, and two more Fire Elves step towards the storage room. </p>
    <p>The first is short, and clad in ornate Chevalier armor that contrasts with his dark expression and curly red beard. The second is… somewhat oddly square-shaped, and wearing a jaunty leather cap and an extremely fierce glare on his face.</p>
    <p>The first marches over to the Terror, and presents her with a crisp salute. “Sir,” he says, moving to stand at attention.</p>
    <p>“Centurion Goldlaurel,” Terror says, eyeing the elf trailing behind him. “Thank you both for your patience.” </p>
    <p>The stockier fire elf grunts, his glare trailing between Terror and the Centurion.  “Patience, “ he intones in a voice several octaves too low, “is precisely what I found lacking.  I grew tired of this one’s incessant insistence.”  Though the words are harsh, there is no edge to the statement.  It might even be construed as somewhat humorous.</p>
    <p>“Yet you had no complaints when I insisted we head downstairs,” the centurion says mildly. “Other than that you were out of furniture to smash.”</p>
    <p>Tallflower, who had been hauling a trio of jugs from the kitchen into the potluck, grimaces. </p>
    <p>“I’m afraid, barkeep, your chairs were unable to keep up with the weight requirement,” Goldlaurel says, before Tallflower can reply. </p>
    <p>The stout elf narrows his eyes, but then looks to the side.  “...I can scarcely be held accountable for your choices in furnishing construction.  Perhaps if you had considered anything more sturdy than wood, it would not have been an issue.” </p>
    <p>“...I’ll see if I can get a concrete couch or two moved upstairs,” Tallflower says sadly. “<small>Those were expensive, too.</small>” </p>
    <p>The broad elf harrumphs, but still avoids eye contact.  “If it is coinage you desire, you will not find me wanting.” he says, before stopping abruptly as his eyes alight on Veth.  His eyebrow raises. </p>
    <p>Tallflower shakes his head. “You’re my guest,” he says nervously. “I should have just moved the heavier furniture up there in the first place.” </p>
    <p>“Sounds to me like your guest can move their own heavier furniture up there if the others didn’t meet the required weight limit.”  Trischal quips as she arrives through the same door, a small basket in hand.  </p>
    <p>A badger insistently shoves her aside and squeezes his way through, nose wiggling as he waddles closer to the general vicinity of food items and ignoring the overflow of elves in the room.</p>
    <p>“Yes I never feed you,” she grumbles, “You are but skin and bone.  Not like you just ate or anything, noooo.”</p>
    <p>“That’s out secret Trisch,” Jarn ducks through the door behind her, “We’re always hungry.”</p>
    <p>The young half elf pulls a wrapped package of food through the door with him. His gear is a bit more dark elf in style now, as is the new tattoo on his right forearm. He still carries the same plain iron pick, however. He places the food on the table, a basic but serviceable sampling of dark elf rations.</p>
    <p>“Wow,” he comments to himself as he looks around the room, “Glad I’ve been working on my elven…” </p>
    <p>Fury, who had been chatting with Skulk, waves in the newcomers’ general direction. “Hi Jarn! Welcome to Surt!”</p>
    <p>“Uh, thanks Fury Ma’am,” Jarn waves politely and slightly nervously, “I’m a Sapper now. Joined up and everything, thanks to Trischal.”</p>
    <p>As she walks up to the table as well to deposit her small basket, Trischal gives Jarn a slap on the back.  “All I did was give you the ok.  The rest was all you, kid.  You earned it.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you, ma’am,” Jarn blushes a bit, “It’s all I could think to do.”</p>
    <p>“Well it worked and here we all are,” Trischal waves a hand at the food, “I’m just glad there are now things that you and Fuzzy can tear through without me feeling like I’m starving the both of you ravenous fiends.” </p>
    <p>“Welcome!” Tallflower says, eagerly breaking away from the squat Fire Elf’s glare. “Can I get you anything in particular? Wine, or mead, maybe? We’ve had a few Dark Elves drop by a season or so ago, and I got a few tips from them on what’s popular in Hilt’Inn.”</p>
    <p>“Wait, you have mead?” Jarn perks up, “I haven’t had mead in forever!” </p>
    <p>“Well, you’re in luck!” Tallflower says. “I’ve got a bottle of Leafstorm Special I meant to break out earlier -- it’s a local brew, but it’s very popular with tourists. Give me just a minute to fetch it from the kitchen!”</p>
    <p>Tallflower scurries into the kitchen, stepping back out a few moments later with several cups and an ornate jug depicting a twisting fiddle. He sets cups and fiddle onto the potluck table, and then waves to Veth. “You wanted to try the mead, right? See if you can get this cork out for me.”</p>
    <p>Barry, who had been deliberately standing in the hallway for most of the party, peaks into the storage room. “Ah, the special,” he says mildly.</p>
    <p>“You said it’s your best, right?” Tallflower says, still standing by the table.</p>
    <p>“Oh yes, definitely!” Barry says, smiling. “<small>At least for my wallet.</small>” </p>
    <p>"Great!" Veth grins, chomps on the cork of the bottle, a pulls it loose with an undignified plop, "It was Tallflower's idea, he's paying." </p>
    <p>“Consider my wallet satisfied,” Barry says, stepping over to the table and swooping up a mug. “Honestly, the <i>Special</i> is more intended for the Tourist than most customers. Mead tastes a little different when one’s ‘between forms’, apparently, and she had some pointers when last she visited.”</p>
    <p>“Probably does, actually,” Veth nods, “Sense of taste is better.” </p>
    <p>The obviously disguised Fire elf watches Barry as he makes his way around the room.  However, when he speaks of The Tourist, the elf’s expression scrunches up.  Making a low, growling exhalation, he turns to the Centurion.  “...what now, Lucius?  What is one supposed to do in this ritual?  And don’t just say ‘consume.’  It was possible to do that elsewhere.” </p>
    <p>The centurion shrugs. “Imbibe quantities of alcohol as a test of fortitude? That’s the most typical usage for ‘rituals’ like this, as you put it. In theory it also provides a moment to ‘let loose’, and observe your comrades while their defenses are lowered. Get a better understanding of who they are. ...Personally, however, I’m more interested in the food.” </p>
    <p>The stocky elf makes an appreciative grunt.  “So… you challenge eachother to become increasingly impaired, and you believe that the elf they are when impaired is their truer self?”</p>
    <p>“Sure!” Veth grins.</p>
    <p>“Uh… I guess, when you put it that way,” Jarn scratches his head. </p>
    <p>“Absolutely correct,” centurion Lucius says. He pauses. “Though in your case, that may take a significant amount of mead indeed. Barkeep!” </p>
    <p>The stocky elf closes his eyes.  “...I would call it a madness, but in comparison to things I have already accepted, it pales.  Very well.  I will meet this challenge.”  He firmly grasps the drink as it is served, quaffing deeply… and makes an <i>expression</i> as he does so.  Nevertheless, he continues until the drink is consumed. </p>
    <p>The centurion shrugs. “To victory,” he says, taking a mug and following suit. And then immediately going into a coughing fit as the rather concentrated mead hits the back of his throat.</p>
    <p>Veth laughs “To getting shitfaced!” and slams bag a mug, coughing only slightly.</p>
    <p>“To, uh… to better times!” Jarn takes a slower swig of the mead, actually bothering to savor it. His eyebrows perk up a little. </p>
    <p>“To absent friends,” Barry says, taking a quick sip. He glances over at Fury, and then at Skulk.</p>
    <p>“Nine hells no,” Fury says. “I <i>remember</i> what happened with the <i>last</i> mead you brought in here, and <i>no thank you</i>.” </p>
    <p>“You don’t want to see how I drink that,” Skulk rumbles.</p>
    <p>The Square Elf’s eyes leap to stare at Skulk… but then unfocus as he reaches the dregs of his drink.  Pulling the cup from his mouth, he smacks loudly.  “...It… is <i>sweet</i>.”  He smacks once more, pulling a face.  “...Why… is it sweet?” </p>
    <p>“Alcohol is an organic substance,” Hunger says. “From ‘organos’, meaning ‘has organs’. In this case, plant organs, or sugar.”</p>
    <p>“It’s made from honey,” Barry clarifies.</p>
    <p>“Cuts the bitter so you can drink more!” Veth keeps her grin up.</p>
    <p>“I just kinda like it…” Jarn says quietly as he slowly savors the drink, finishing last. </p>
    <p>“Available in taverns near you, once this invasion is so kind as to end,” Barry says. “I have half-a-dozen barrels gathering dust in Disr right now. Sitting there, waiting desperately to be drunk. Like myself.” Barry pours another sip into his mug.</p>
    <p>With a raised eyebrow at the odd ritual beginning to take shape, Trischal snags a mug and sniffs at it.  “Sweet, eh?  Has to be better than whatever it is that Greg and Shy love to drown in so much,” she states with a mutter before taking a large swallow.</p>
    <p>Her face scrunches and ears flick back.  She even sticks her tongue out as she sets the still fairly full mug down with a full body shudder.  “Mm, nope.  Y’ guys have fun with that…”</p>
    <p>“Your choice,” the centurion says. He turns to the Square Elf. “Another round, sirrah?” </p>
    <p>Said elf has continued pulling a face, but as his eyes flick to Lucius, his expression flattens.  “Aff.  I shall assume the flavor as yet another part of the trial.  Libate me, brewelf.”</p>
    <p>“As your will,” Lucius says, pouring more mead into Square-Elf’s mug, and then a bit into his own. As soon as the mug is filled, the quadrilaterelf begins quaffing in earnest once more.  After getting a little more than halfway through, however, he gags, coughing a little of the spirit around the cup. Still, he soldiers on, though the expression on his face has become a little more pained.</p>
    <p>“I keep going as long as someone else is paying!” Veth laughs and pours a mug. Jarn quietly pours himself another mug. Seeing the brick house of an elf start to falter, Veth dramatically manages to throw more than half of hers back with a single pull, though she’s glowing in the ears a bit at the end.</p>
    <p>Jarn, for his part, continues to savor his. He does in fact drink the whole thing, but gives the empty mug a forlorn look when he’s done.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know why you’re all chugging it so fast, it’s so good…” he mumbles with reddening cheeks.</p>
    <p>“ ‘Being drunk’ can be pretty fun, too,” Barry says, smiling through another sip. “I’m just glad they’re enjoying it.”</p>
    <p>“Or perhaps this is getting out of hand,” Hunger says, turning to Terror. </p>
    <p>The solid chunk of elf lowers his mug, audibly swallowing the last of his drink.  “ ‘Enjoyment’ has no place in this, Bard.” he growls out.  “Not with this… candied poison.  Perhaps if I were to have a tolerable drink, like barley wine… not something made with some kind of grotesque plant organ.”  He burps, staring directly at Hunger, but then holds his mug out once more. </p>
    <p>Veth is already pouring another mug. She takes the opportunity to pour another heaping mug for the brick wall disguised as an elf. The glow has spread from Veth's ears to her face and nose, but her huge grin continues unabated as she drinks. Jarn, however, stifles a hiccup while his next mug is poured.</p>
    <p>The young half elf gives the jug a forlorn look as the last of it is poured into his mug. He swirls the mug and takes a slow sip from it. He gives it a look, then takes a longer swig. When he sets the mug back down on the table, his hand is significantly furrier and sharper than it was.</p>
    <p>"Wow, you were right!" The werewolverine hiccups in his hybrid form, "It <i>does</i> taste better!" </p>
    <p>The mug slips from Barry’s hands.</p>
    <p>“Look, we can get you a to-go mug or something,” Fury says to Skulk. She starts turning back towards the buffet table. “I’m certain there will be plenty of mead left ov--YEEP!”</p>
    <p>Trischal gives a long suffering sigh of ‘I knew I should have cut him off but I didn’t’ before letting it turn into a sharp whistle.  Fuzzy dutifully comes trundling over and sits in front of the significantly furrier Jarn, his bear sized bulk becoming an even more pointed obstacle for the elves in the room.</p>
    <p>The badger makes a grumbling noise at Jarn, but otherwise keeps a sharp eye on everyone along with a tense Trischal. </p>
    <p>Allophryne bumbles into the room with a plate piled with rice with a sticky sauce on top.  Seeing the tension, he finds a seat on the Were-Sofa therianthrope alligator and munches his food offering.</p>
    <p>"<small>Oops.</small>" Jarn mumbles. </p>
    <p>Though the boxelf approached his most recent round with some caution, quaffing carefully to avoid choking on the cloying taste, he stops mid chug when he notices what every other elf in the room is reacting to.  Partially concealed behind the glass, Jarn can still see as his pupils narrow… before he then throws back the rest of the drink in a single swallow.  Dropping the mug unceremoniously, he stands to his full height, squares up (excessively) to the hybrid, and opens his mouth.</p>
    <p>Another belch is the first thing to escape, followed by another sickened expression.  However, he recovers enough to utter, in a low growl, “I suppose I am to believe you are another of the ‘good’ ones.”  His voice drips with malice and sarcasm.  And honey.  Head motionless, his pinprick eyes swivel… landing on Barry.  “Bard.  Explain.”  </p>
    <p>Barry opens his mouth. And then closes it, and tries again. “This is a new one on me, I’m afraid. I apologize; my word-of-the-street is failing me.” He glances over at Trischal. “Umm, Trischal… <small>help me out here…</small>”</p>
    <p>Fuzzy gives an unappreciative grunt and makes an attempt to square up to the Square-Elf’s squaring.  It is not entirely successful.</p>
    <p>Trischal cuts a quick glance to Barry, then refocuses on the obviously disguised elf.  She crosses her arms as she speaks up, “He is mine.  He followed us home, you could say, and has been helping my people ever since.  This includes fighting afflicted dark elves with us to save more people from its madness.”  Her tone takes a turn to biting, “So to answer your grating sarcasm, yes he is one of the ‘good ones’ and I owe him for the lives of many of the dark elves that are in this city right now.” </p>
    <p>“And,” Barry coughs. “Was definitely a Lycan when we met at the Asavardi Potluck, right? So… no real surprises here?”</p>
    <p>“If he was a wolf elf, I would have killed him myself,” Trischal states plainly.  “No, he is a Lycan.  I can speak true on that.  He was, and still technically is, a military secret.” </p>
    <p>Allophryne elbows Hunger, who is sitting on his animal companion.</p>
    <p>“Non, not Afflicted,” he adds helpfully as an aside.</p>
    <p>“I assumed not, given that you’re currently in the same room,” Hunger said. He glances over at Terror. “Same as I also assume you were aware of this, since he arrived through the same tunnels as you did.” </p>
    <p>Terror nods. “But only as of the trip through the tunnels.”</p>
    <p>“But you <i>knew?</i>” Fury says, already at several candles worth of glow. “Why doesn’t anyone ever tell me--” she cuts off, and slaps a hand over her mask. “Never mind. Just, never mind.”</p>
    <p>“Sorry…?” Jarn offers. </p>
    <p>“Don’t apologize, dear; it’s not your fault,” Fury says, gritting her teeth.</p>
    <p>Veth leans over Hunger and nabs some of Allophryne’s rice, munching as she watches with excitement. </p>
    <p>“I am sorry as well, Lady Fury,” Trischal’s tone has significantly less bite in it.  “This secret hasn’t been told to a lot of people, not just you.  It was safer for the dark elves and Jarn that way.” </p>
    <p>The definitely disguised elf looks… not overly pleased with the explanation given.  His pupils do expand a little, however, and his hands stop clenching and unclenching.  Instead, he opts to stare Jarn directly in the eyes (or as well as can be accomplished currently).  “I see.  And so, you are a warrior, then, in service to elfkind?  Turned against your previous ilk, and found new-born companionship, serving and served alike?”  His tone is… well, it sounds like he’s trying to make it neutral, but failing miserably.</p>
    <p>"Yes, no, yes, yes," Jarn answers after processing, "I haven't… um… turned against my ilk because they want me to be here. To make up for past mistakes… but I'm not here for that, because I was, like, four when the war ended. I had nothing to do with it. I'm here because I want to help. Serving and served alike… yeah, I kinda like that." </p>
    <p>The trunkelf’s brow knits together in a simultaneous display of puzzlement and anger (‘confurious’), but some of the tenseness leaves his body.  “...Four?  Four what?  Decades?  You look no juve to me…” He sounds uncertain.</p>
    <p>"Years," Jarn says, "Um, I'm only half elf. I'm twenty one." </p>
    <p>In the war between ire and befuddlement, befuddlement has scored big.  The bigelf’s mouth gapes a little.  “...What?  <i>Years?</i>  No.  An impossibility.  That’s…”  His head swivels over to the other elves, soaking in their absence of incredulity.  He looks back to Jarn.  “...Half <i>what?</i>  Ani-  An… <b><i>Hells.</i></b>  Half… those creatures?” It seems the alcohol is finally starting to hit him a little, interfering with his pronunciation.</p>
    <p>"Dude," Jarn frowns, "<i>Rude.</i> I'm half human. Half elf, half human, all wolverine. See?"</p>
    <p>Jarn holds up and wiggles a five fingered claw.</p>
    <p>"<small>Oh right,</small>" He mutters before shifting back to humanoid form and doing the same with a five fingered hand.</p>
    <p>Denseelf’s mouth gapes even more.  “<i>...Humans?</i>  Humans, those… they can…”  His gaze drifts somewhat, as he struggles on whether to be more shocked, sickened, or curious.</p>
    <p>Jarn lowers his hand again, giving the elf a confused look.</p>
    <p>"Yeesh, dude," Jarn says, "Don't worry, it's not contagious." </p>
    <p>Chonkelf’s attention is focused back on Jarn, and brings a scowl with it.  “Of course I know that.  Do not treat me as a <i>fool.</i>  My dismay is that… I was led to believe that few humans make it past even their twelfth decade.  That they are practically a peoples of juveniles.  Infants!  What elf with even a <i>shred</i> of moral fiber would consider… such a thing?”  He sounds sincerely perplexed.</p>
    <p>Jarn looks desperately around the room looking for a way out. He does not find it. He inhales a bit before taking this one on.</p>
    <p>"Yeah…" he exhales, "We grow up faster too. People who aren't elves just age faster. So, like, I'm twenty-one years old but I'm not a little kid like a full elf would be. Like um…"</p>
    <p>He counts on his fingers, "Yeah, like, about one-twenty in elf years. I think." </p>
    <p>The bewildered, bewidened elf’s expression goes through a few quick shifts.  “<i>...Physically</i>, perhaps, but… in mind, spirit!  Any elf could see…”  He, too, looks around the room for a way out… and finds no more opportunity than Jarn did.  Likely, less.  Bereft of support, he stands there, dumbfounded, expression slowly growing darker as he stares between Jarn, and the door through which he arrived.  Finally, he seems to come to a decision, stretching out his arm, and pointing it at Tallflower.</p>
    <p>“Brewelf.  Another mug.  I have… misplaced mine,” he intones, as firmly as he can in the moment. </p>
    <p>“Right away,” Tallflower says, scampering over with another mug from the kitchen. Jarn gets a sour look on his face and gestures for Tallflower to bring him one as well.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, you can call me whatever you want," Jarn says, "Monster, child, creature, animal, whatever, and I ain't the smartest brick on the wall, but spirit? Spirit I <i>got.</i> I have the will to get things done, and I know what I am. Hate me all you want, but I earned my spot here and I'm not going <i>anywhere.</i>" </p>
    <p>Snatching the mug from Tallflower, the unnamed-but-totally-already-blew-his-cover elf brings it swiftly to his lips, draining the beverage and managing to avoid gagging on it once more.  Lowering it, he still has a little glistening on his lips and chin.  “<i>Hate.</i>  It should be easy to hate you.  For what you are.  For what you <i>mean.</i>  In these times, I have made <i>Hate</i> my fuel, my sustenance, and let it carry me when all else has abandoned me.”  He clumsily wipes his chin, and then points a fat finger at Jarn.  “...It is that I now <i>struggle</i> with it… with <i>you</i>… that vexes me.  I do not understand you.  And so, I <i>shall</i>.”  He lowers his finger to Jarn’s mug, freshly delivered.  “I would see you <i>imbibe.</i> I would see you <i>impaired.</i>  I would see you <i>exposed.</i>  And then… <i>then,</i> I will <i>know</i> you.  <i>Badger</i>.”  He finishes off this impassioned, slurred speech with another respectable belch.</p>
    <p>"Oh you're on!" Jarn grabs a mug as Tallflower attempts to hand it to him. He tried to swig it dramatically, but suddenly coughs and spits back mostly into the mug. He shakes his head, regrets the gesture, then slowly starts polishing it off.</p>
    <p>"An' I'm a woov… wof… woovoov… woofereen," Jarn slurs whatever he was trying to say.</p>
    <p>"Oh shit, we're back on?" Veth hops back up to the table, "Mommy's massive mammaries, I am <i>so</i> in. Hit me!"</p>
    <p>An increasingly concerned Tallflower passed Veth a mug. She manages to get through it, though it's clearly a struggle. </p>
    <p>Allophryne offers the dish of sticky rice to Hunger.</p>
    <p>“Thank you, but I’m afraid my mask wouldn’t cooperate,” Hunger says mildly. </p>
    <p>“This is getting worse,” Terror says. “Tal--”</p>
    <p>“In a moment,” Hunger says, waving her off. “I’m <i>curious.</i> This is taking an interesting turn.”</p>
    <p>Terror rolls her eyes, and loosens her hammer in its sheath. </p>
    <p>“Anyone else?” Tallflower asks, scanning the room.</p>
    <p>“Do you have anything that’s <i>not</i> mead?” Fury asks, keeping her hand over her eyes and mask.</p>
    <p>“...I’ll get a mug of wine for you, your grace,” Tallflower says.</p>
    <p>“A big one, please,” Fury says.</p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p>In some wars, there are no winners. Mutually assured destruction is a brutal thing, and a concept that these brash competitors have had harshly demonstrated to them… assuming they will remember it when they regain consciousness. </p>
    <p>The casualties of war are scattered about the Howl's store room. Jarn has leaned back in his chair, snoring absurdly loud but thankfully elven. Veth is curled up in a ball on the floor around an empty mug. The huge elf has stayed where he is, a nigh immovable mass in his chair. </p>
    <p>Fury staggers to her feet, more sober than any of the competitors, but perhaps less than had been previously intended. She rubs a hand over her face.</p>
    <p>“Morning!” Hunger says chipperly, sipping from a mug through a thin wooden reed.</p>
    <p>“Mmmph,” Fury mutters. She glances over at the collapsed pile of elf that is Squatelf. “So… what’re we going to do about Echo?” she says.</p>
    <p>“...nrkh, rip n...grf,” the bulk mutters unintelligibly before resuming his steady breathing.</p>
    <p>“Terror’s outside, gathering a few trusted body-hauling experts who can help carry him upstairs,” Hunger says. </p>
    <p>“And Jarn?” Fury pauses. “You know, I do have some new ideas I’ve been studying about, on intra-planar inertialess travel…”</p>
    <p>“One should not <i>Dimension Door</i> while drunk, Fury,” Hunger says. “Trust me on this.”</p>
    <p>“I’m not drunk!” Fury insists. “I just have a hangover, that’s all.”</p>
    <p>“Go sit in a corner and drink some water,” Hunger says. “I’ll see if I can find a cart to load them into.” </p>
    <p>Allophryne pushes cups of water into various elven hands.</p>
    <p>A Fuzzy-lounging Trischal glances up from where she has been reading a well worn copy of Love Bites.  “I’ll take care of Jarn,” she says with amusement.  “He’ll probably need to be deposited into an area that does well with vomit.”</p>
    <p>Her lounge grumbles unhappily as she stands up and moves over to the loudly snoring half-elf.  With minimal effort, Trischal hefts Jarn’s limp form over her shoulders and stands in wait for directions. </p>
    <p>“Latrine’s at the other end of the hall,” a clearly exhausted Tallflower mutters. “Let me know if it starts smelling extra-weird… sometimes the fissure gets clogged.”</p>
    <p>Trischal gives the exhausted barkeep a nod and begins the trek in that direction.  “If he makes a mess, I’m going to make him clean it up.”</p>
    <p>Fuzzy harumphs with continued displeasure and settles back down.  His nose wiggles as his beady eyes watch everyone left in the room. His eyes narrow a little, glaring in one of the far corners.</p>
    <p>“Hello…” Ink mumbles from the dark corner he has been hiding in, “Nice badger…”</p>
    <p>“Jerk,” Skulk mutters from somewhere. </p>
    <p>Fury waves a hand, from a corner opposite Ink's. "Hi--" Fury says, way too loudly. She winces, and coughs. "Hi Ink!" she says quietly, waving emphatically.</p>
    <p>"Hi," Ink waves back slowly with an expression that's hopefully supposed to be a smile.</p>
    <p>"You missed quite a party," Fury says, staggering to her feet, and knocking over a mug half-full of water. She grimaces. "...I may have had a bit too much to drink," she says.</p>
    <p>“Um,” Ink’s hand kind of stays up in a waving gesture, “I was here…” </p>
    <p>"Aww…" Fury says. She staggers over to Ink's side of the room, and then drops onto the floor close by. "Did you manage to see me embarrass myself?"</p>
    <p>“Embarrass?” He looks over at her, “Um… maybe a little…” </p>
    <p>"...I meant the 'shrieking in surprise at Jarn' thing," she says. "Not the 'singing competition' thing. Let's… just try to forget that happened at all, really. ...I may be a little too easily startled." She pauses. "Did you hear about the rally?"</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Ink says, “You saved Surt. Again.” </p>
    <p>Fury smiles. "...I guess I kinda did." She pauses. "<i>And</i> I gave Faustus a nice scare, too! You should have seen his face! He was <i>furious!</i>" The smile fades slightly. "And… now he knows that I manipulated him. That I <i>can</i>. ...I have mixed feelings on that part."</p>
    <p>Ink tilts his head a little.</p>
    <p>“Were you going to hide forever?” </p>
    <p>Fury shakes her head. "I think I just... would have preferred he found out right before immediately dying forever. He'll be more careful after this. More wary."</p>
    <p>“Hrm,” Ink grunts, “Will send him a letter. Politely worded. Maybe he’ll die.” </p>
    <p>She giggles. “One can only hope. At least he’ll know we’re thinking of him. In a grave. Filled with concrete. And then detonated, just in case.” Her eyes light up. “Oh! That reminds me! I figured out a neat trick! ...It’ll have to wait until after we kick Faustus out, because he’s doing… whatever he’s doing to block it… but I figured out how to <i>teleport</i>!”</p>
    <p>“Oh!” Ink perks up a bit, “Haven’t tried, though?” </p>
    <p>“Nope,” Fury says. “So… I could just be entirely wrong, and all I’ve figured out is how to dice myself into pieces and spread them across the landscape… but I have a good feeling about this. I think it’ll work.”</p>
    <p>“Hrm,” Ink rubs his chin, “Recommend double checking.” </p>
    <p>“Well, I know <i>you</i> know how to do it properly,” Fury said, grinning. “So we could do a comparison. A competition, even. See who can teleport the furthest without getting diced into cubes.”</p>
    <p>“Um,” Ink gives her an odd look, “Could… just check…” </p>
    <p>“I’m kidding!” Fury says. “...Mostly. I may still be a little drunk. But I’ll check before I actually <i>try</i> to <i>teleport</i>, I promise.”</p>
    <p>“Can help,” Ink notes. </p>
    <p>“I’d hoped you would,” she replies. “You’re a good teacher.”</p>
    <p>“No,” Ink replies, “I am objectively not.”</p>
    <p class="center"><a href="#Top">-FIN-</a></p>
    <h2>Surt II: The Sequel</h2>
    <p>Sometime after the Potluck ends, the Terror retires to an upstairs guest room, taking with her a few candles and a small amphora of water.</p>
    <p>She locks the door, removes her mask and armor, and pulls a vial of ink from a pocket under her shoulderplate. She mixes a bit of squid ink into the amphora, before carefully applying the mixture to herself, and in an wavelike spiral over the floor of the room. She pours the remainder into a dish at the center.</p>
    <p>"Mother of oceans," she says quietly, eyes closed. "Take me into your grasp. I am a fragment of your whole, a pattern within a pattern within a pattern…”</p>
    <p>She pauses, fidgeting. <i>This… feels off.</i> She tries again.</p>
    <p>“I rest in your Hands, following your currents towards destiny…” She pauses. “...No. I’m done with that crap. Done with ‘destiny’ and ‘paths’ and every other other little doctrinal diatribe that got forced down my throat when I was a kid. So if you are listening, I’ll be a little less formal about this for now, please. At least until I can wrap my head around what was real, and what was just convenient.”</p>
    <p>She chuckles to herself. “Master Jimn always said it was the duty of the laity to question, not the clergy or the Champion… but he also said that faith and whale oil will cure acne, and that never really seemed to work for him. So… I’m questioning. I’m not really expecting answers, but I’m going to deploy them in front of you anyway.</p>
    <p>“Why me? Aquila of Muspelham didn’t really <i>deserve</i> to be a Champion. She was a brash, foolhardy <i>idiot</i>, who walked straight into a fight she couldn’t win and expected <i>you</i> to do all the work. Cal’s reach, you were <i>already</i> doing all the work for her; silversheen or no silversheen, unless <i>all</i> of the ‘champions’ she bested were puffed-up lightweights, she didn’t deserve to handle any of them.</p>
    <p>“And then you brought me back anyway. Why? ...Was it to repay you for what you granted me? What did I have that my mother didn’t?</p>
    <p>“Finally… I think I know a little better what it means, now. And… I’m starting to wonder how much Surt needs <i>Terror</i>. Being Terror was important during the war; being Terror also meant I had our entire army outside of the city when the Wolf Elves invaded. And I’m pretty sure they were counting on me “being Terror” for that too. That they knew what I would do because of it.</p>
    <p>“So maybe we don’t need Terror as much any more. Maybe we need a Champion -- for real, this time. ...I’m not sure if that’s me, but I think I should at least try. To actually earn it.”</p>
    <p>The only answer is silence. </p>
    <p>Terror sighed. “Helpful as ever, Mom,” she said, smiling. </p>
    <p class="center"><a href="#Top">-- Fin --</a></p>
    <h2 id="Amie Navire">Amie Navire</h2>
    <p>(And Partager, and Gerdr)</p>
    <p>It’s a relatively rare event for more than one flotilla to be in the same place for the New Year’s Potluck.  So Amie Navire and Partager are having the largest party their wartime supplies will allow, held in an open field just on the shores of the Maar outside Gerdr.  And they’ve invited the whole of Gerdr to join in the festivities.</p>
    <p>Including Vita. Who is owed an autograph. And also thinks she knows how to cook.</p>
    <p>She doesn’t.</p>
    <p>“Plakouscake is supposed to look like that,” she insists, setting a brown, misshapen lump of pastry onto the buffet table. “In its original recipe, at least. The color’s from all the honey. As are the bubbles, too.”</p>
    <p>“Appearances can be deceiving,” Ehra notes sagely as the blade elves add a few plates of freshly delivered potato based dishes, “The essence of a cake is in its flavor more than any surface deep aesthetics, in my opinion at any rate.” </p>
    <p>“So,” Embebi says, while glaring hungrily at the various tuber-based dishes being trotted out, “one does not need to be a cake… to be a cake?”  She gives a wry grin, before plucking a sample from whatever dish seems to most resemble a whole potato. It is warm and roasted, filled with a bit of cheese and spices.</p>
    <p>“A keen observation,” Ehra nods solemnly, “I believe that - <i>hrnk</i> -” Ehra struggles to control his facial expression as he samples the attempted cake.</p>
    <p>“Tastes great,” He manages through tears, “Paragon of cakeness.”</p>
    <p>“Really?” Vita says, perhaps with a little too much enthusiasm. “I can never get anyone else to try it -- everyone’s always like ‘plakouscake isn’t supposed to have oregano in it’ and I’m like ‘but it has bay leaf on it, and you put oregano in things with bay leaves’, and anyway I’ll bring another one to the next potluck too. As long as Terror doesn’t accidentally knock it out a window like she did last time.” </p>
    <p>"Fascinating," Ehra manages a pyrrhic victory over the pastry, "How unconventional." </p>
    <p>“Really goes well with the caramelized honey, right?” Vita grins. “Anyway, I should get to stuffing my face with potatoes. Don’t get these super often in Surt.” She picks up a plate, and starts piling potatoes onto it, sticking them together with wads of mashed potato.</p>
    <p>“Quite,” Ehra glances to Embebi, looking to change the topic, “Ah, Embebi. I haven’t had a chance to speak with you yet. I wanted to express my gratitude and my happiness that the Crag are joining us here as allies.” </p>
    <p>Embebi stops chewing her spud, giving Ehra a raised eyebrow.  She chews for a bit more, trying to think of a response.  She swallows heavily.  “Aff.  I’ll accept the gratitude, though it’s not much needed.  Honest said, I’d figure that we’re both here more for our own needs than eachother’s.  Still, it’s good that that comes of some aid to you and yours.”  She speaks carefully, like they’re the words she is supposed to say, rather than the ones that come naturally.</p>
    <p>Ehra gives her a curious look.</p>
    <p>"Whatever the reason, this is the first time a Crag commanding officer has actually coordinated with us, rather than simply attack the same target," he chuckles, "Much less attended a party. If that's only to suit our own needs, then it's to both our benefit anyway." </p>
    <p>Embebi raises an eyebrow.  “‘Party’?  I took this for a feast.”  She glances at the piles of potatoes.  Her eyes light up somewhat.  “-O’course, perhaps those are more the same thing for you folks.  If so, I’d say you have the right of it.”  Her smile is wry for a moment, but then drops.  “As to the coordination… Aff, I recognize that was a rare thing till now.  I can’t guarantee it won’t be rare again, but… Well, let it be said that I recognize how <i>intricate</i> things are here… so many moving pieces.  So much at stake.  So, way I saw it, it was best to figure out how we could avoid ‘stepping on toes’, I think your expression is.”</p>
    <p>“An accurate assessment,” Ehra nods, “I admit, in the past, we have been forced to plan <i>around</i> or perhaps <i>for</i> the crag, rather than with you.” </p>
    <p>“Is fair,” Vita says, between mouthfuls. “ ‘ts not like we’re a hundred percent great at coordinating either. Hells, we had riots when Captain Villhook and Bravo Division first showed up.”</p>
    <p>A couple of Fire Elves wander up to the table, trays of breads and dolmas in hand. They give Vita and her ‘cake’ sidelong glances, and then set the trays onto the table and walk quickly away. </p>
    <p>Embebi sighs and rubs her eyes, breaking her already tenuous facade of sternness.  Her hand almost gravitates to scratch at the bandage around her ear, but she checks it in time.  “Aff, and I know full well why that was such a trouble.  I know that Sal- that the Echo of Blood had pretty much written off any attempts to ‘coordinate’ with lowland militaries… the Descent proved pretty well that our ways of doing war were… fundamentally incompatible.  But the way I see it, it’s not that likely that our way… I suppose I should say, our old way… is likely to get any footing from this point, quiaff?  At some point, somebody’s gotta face facts as they are… not how we hope them to be.” </p>
    <p>"Now <i>that</i> is a wisdom," Ehra grins. </p>
    <p>Prosalirus and Ny are having a heated debate in Sylvan while helping Smilisca roll a barrel of marinated crabs over to the little unlit bonfire where the other leadership are gathering.  Words are being exchanged at a high rate of fire over Smilisca’s head while he patiently rolls the barrel with a very grouchy expression on his face.</p>
    <p>They’re still arguing while Smilisca stands the barrel up and pops its lid to start offering foodstuffs to the gathering dignitaries.</p>
    <p>When they don’t even stop their debate while he’s trying to distribute food he finally loses his cool.</p>
    <p>“Non non non.”  The Dread Wizard Smilisca stands to his full height and shoots the arguing River elves his very best glare.  The effect is ruined by his truly hideous hat, but that does not stop him.  “Oarmasters, non.  If’n yall can’t decide, just find someone else t’pick.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, Navigator Smilisca, I think I can agree to that if Nyctibatrachus will consent.”  Prosalirus nods agreeably.</p>
    <p>Ny folds her arms and eyes the older elf suspiciously.</p>
    <p>“Weh,” she says, a sudden idea sparking a bit of mischief in her expression.  “We oughta axe Ms. Grassforest.  She’s th’ right proper authority here in Gerdr, weh?”</p>
    <p>Prosalirus’s expression darkens.</p>
    <p>“I,” he pauses, considering his words carefully, “can agree to that.  It is factually correct.”</p>
    <p>Smilisca rolls his eyes at the two of them and tries to find the Smoke to settle their argument.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t take him long. “Crabs?” Vita says curiously, fishing one out of the barrel with a bit of careful prestidigitation. “Can I just, like, pop the whole thing in my mouth? Or do I have to pry it open first?” </p>
    <p>“Weh, these ain’t the softshell kind, so you gotta crack em open first.”  Smilisca helpfully demonstrates.  “Them Oarmasters are debatin’ who oughta be lightin’ this year’s bonfire - so we ken let Luck know where t’find all’a’us.  They ain’t gon’ agree before it’s next year.  Mais - who’d you pick?”</p>
    <p>Vita pauses. “Ehra,” she says finally. “Between all forces presented here, there are two generals whose armies will be most likely to bear the brunt of an invasion into Surt -- his and Litoria’s. And Litoria brought a massive living siege engine, as well as a mobile fortress, so I think she’s already had a lot of luck. Ehra might need it more.”</p>
    <p>“See!  I done told you it oughta be th’ Grandmaster!”  Ny gloats at her victory.</p>
    <p>Prosalirus grumbles something unintelligible that almost sounds like, “<small>of course she wouldn’t pick herself.</small>”</p>
    <p>“Mais that settles it ‘en!”  Smilisca passes more crabs into Vita’s hands.  “An’ no more arguin’ on it!”</p>
    <p>Ehra steps up to the table, dusting off a few crumbs from his robe.</p>
    <p>“Vita, I thank you for such an honor,” he smiles at her, “And I would be happy to do so… but, the river elf tradition is that someone who was both fortunate and talented in the previous year is to light the fire, so that they may pass that fortune on to others… and, if I may be so bold, you have accomplished more than I.” </p>
    <p>Vita hesitates. “...I mean, not really?” she says carefully. “Most of what I’ve done is pretty normal. Paid the river elves to give us food, tried to ambush the Wolf Elf supply lines and got bushwacked for it… called for backup in Gerdr… I mean, the more noble and great thing is that you guys showed up. I just did my job.”</p>
    <p>“So did all of us,” Ehra states. </p>
    <p>A bit of smoke seeps from Vita’s ears. “Yeah, but… you didn’t have to. I’m not saying we don’t appreciate it -- we do! We do! It’s more that… I don’t think doing what I did is particularly special, because it’s what I’m supposed to do. You showed up to back us up, even though it’s not like Surt’s your city, and we haven’t always been the friendliest. You and the Litoria and Embebi deserve more credit than I do.”</p>
    <p>“It’s not about credit, or or who did the most, or who is the most special,” Ehra explains, “It’s about who has guided us.” </p>
    <p>The smoke intensifies. “...Thank you for the compliment… but can I also go with ‘not much of a public speaker’?” she says. “I mean I can do it if it’s not supposed to be me, but… I’m not really good at handling all that attention on myself. I’m much more of an ‘in the back, doing the behind the scenes work’ kind of person.”</p>
    <p>“Correct me if I am incorrect,” Ehra glances up at the river elves, “But I believe there is no talking involved at all, only lighting a fire.”</p>
    <p>“Weh, that’s right,” Smilisca confirms, “‘an if’n there’s more gripin’ I’ll jus’ see if Voyager can do it.  Probably easier fer a fire elf though.”</p>
    <p>“You could put a jug of liquor in his mouth, and have him breath over a lit reed and onto the bonfire!” Vita suggests. “...But I’ll light it. Just… don’t be too surprised if I vanish afterwards.”</p>
    <p>“Ain’t no matter if’n you don’t mind missin’ out on th’ dancin, non.”  Smilisca gives her a careful smile.  Ny and Prosalirus have swapped their victories, and Prosalirus looks quite smug.</p>
    <p>“Aww…” Vita says. “I’d be sad to miss that. I’m almost as good a dancer as I am a cook!”</p>
    <p>"Well then we're certainly in for something memorable," Ehra smiles charitably. </p>
    <p>“...Were you planning on dancing, Ehra, sir?” Vita says, glancing sideways at him.</p>
    <p>“Maybe a little,” Ehra gives a cheeky smile. </p>
    <p>“See, now that sounds memorable,” Vita says. “Least if what I’ve heard about your duel with the Ashwalker was half-true.” </p>
    <p>“Whatever you heard like as not understated the matter,” Embebi quips.  “I’d be hard pressed to name a more singularly one-sided challenge.  Bold an’ Brash, that.”  She takes a quick bite of another stuffed potato.  Her face then turns somber with realization.  “...The risks of being a Ristar.  From what I’ve heard, I suppose she came to a poor end after all.” </p>
    <p>“She was in a coma in the Palace, last I’d heard,” Vita says, frowning. “I knew her as a kid, you know? She wasn’t all that bad. A bit stuffy, but kids are always jerks.” </p>
    <p>Embebi grimaces.  “Headdam.  No fitting end for a warrior spirit like hers.  Shame, that.” She chews solemnly.</p>
    <p>There is a rumbling nearby as the hefty hippo Sauver arrives. Her two riders dismount. Bryti steps forward first, wielding a giggin' stick and wearing a green river elf cloak with the trademarked Crocodilian alligator skin hat draped over her shoulder. She plants the spear in the ground and addresses the group.</p>
    <p>"Commanders Smoke and Embebi, Grandmaster," she delivers a snappy salute, "I report that we have discovered a stowaway."</p>
    <p>Litoria hefts a long skinny elf off the back of her hippo. She steps into the torchlight and holds up Amenidal, carrying the dark elf with one hand by the back of his collar like a scruffed cat.</p>
    <p>"Weh," Litoria adds. </p>
    <p>“...Throw him in the brig, I guess?” Vita says.</p>
    <p>Amenidal is not struggling to get out of the hold, but he does sigh at that.  “May I please be put down now, Miss Litoria?  I wasn’t hurting anything.  Just wanted to be here to see if I could help when I heard what was happening.” </p>
    <p>“Mais, non.”  Litoria drops the length of Noodle Elf in the grass.  It’s not a hard landing, like she was trying to almost be gentle there.  “One elf all on their own ain’t gon’ tangle with armies an have a good ending, non.”</p>
    <p>“Right,” Vita says. “It’s keel-hauling for the likes of you.” She pauses. “That’s not a stereotype, is it? I think I read you’re supposed to keel-haul stowaways, but I really haven’t been on a lot of boats.” </p>
    <p>“Perhaps that is what they do in Envoyer,” Prosalirus offers.  “I think we of Amie Navire can find other uses if Gerdr refuses the offer of first choice.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, yeah, definitely,” Vita says. “We appreciate the offer, but it sounds like he was found on sovereign Amie Navire planks, so Amie Navire’s law takes proceed-ance and such. Besides, I wanna see him walk the plank or whatever.”</p>
    <p>“What do you have to say for yourself young man?”  The older river elf gives Amenidal a stern gaze.</p>
    <p>Amenidal is sitting cross legged where the Litoria plopped him, watching everyone with a tilted head.  “Well, I’m a terrible swimmer,” he says dryly, “just ask Jar- uh, anyone really.  So, personally I would prefer to not walk off of a plank.  Then again I do have a few spells that could help with that… but would still prefer not to.  I’m better at magic than I am pretty much everything else so… if you have a use for that… please let me help?” </p>
    <p>Prosalirus greedily glances quickly over to where Smilisca is forlornly rotating a ring on a necklace while eating Vita’s cake-like-object without paying attention to it.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I do think I can find a use for a magician,” he says with a slowly spreading grin.</p>
    <p>Ridiculously large ears perk almost straight up as Amenidal’s posture follows suit.  He looks disgustingly exuberant over the news to the point where his eyes could possibly be sparkling.  It could also be a trick of the light.</p>
    <p>“Really?  Awesome!  I promise I will do what I can,” he babbles then gets a little hesitant, “Though if you need me to scry on things, uh… I’m probably going to have to start begging for money donations.”</p>
    <p>"We could use a caster, particularly with sending, for our main force to allow faster communication with the river elves," Ehra notes, "I suppose we could recruit an attached specialist, if you are willing to travel with a blade elf war camp."</p>
    <p>Amenidal looks wide eyed between Prosalirus and Ehra.  He opens his mouth to speak a few times but has to take a few more moments for his words to catch up with his brain.</p>
    <p>“I have been trying to learn Sending,” he finally manages to squeak out in response to Ehra’s offer, “but I’m afraid I haven’t gotten it down just yet, sir.” </p>
    <p>“How are you at offensives?” Vita asks. “Like <i>Stinking Cloud</i>. That’s a good one; Welves hate it.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, I have a few things including that one,” Amenidal responds automatically and looks down at the extensive tattoo on his left arm.  “Did I prep that one for today… I can’t remember.  I don’t think I did but I can move some things around tomorrow.” </p>
    <p>“Hey, <i>Stinking Cloud</i> buddies!” Vita says. “Seriously, though, that’s a great charge-disruptor. The Expansionary Guard aren’t going anywhere for a bit, so you should still stick with the Blade Elves, but getting you in to at least provide some offensive counters would be a strong play. ...And you said you were working on <i>Sending</i>. Got anything else that’s high-octane? <i>Dimension Door</i> or something like that?”</p>
    <p>Amenidal laughs and his face is slowly turning pink, “I have a uh… special thing that lets me teleport a certain distance without casting a spell.  I do also have <i>Dimension Door</i>, though!  It was pretty easy to pick up once I realized it was similar to what I could already do, just with more oomph and the ability to snag another person.”</p>
    <p>He pauses and thinks for a moment, “<i>Black Tentacles</i> is a fun one.  I haven’t had a chance to play around with that one.  Might be of some use as well.” </p>
    <p>“A ‘fun one’, huh?” Vita grins. “Well, we’ll have to make sure you get a chance to ‘play around’ with it, though you gotta keep some of that to your off-time. No sexual harassment on the battlefield, please.”</p>
    <p>Amenidal stares blankly at Vita.  It is obvious when he finally catches on as his skin condition flares up from the tips of his ears all the way down to the top of his chest.  “I- wha- no!” he sputters and waves his hands wildly, “N-not like that!  I wouldn’t- I haven’t - !” </p>
    <p>"He's lying," Bryti comments dryly. </p>
    <p>Vita’s grin cracks, releasing a torrent of witchy laughter.</p>
    <p>Amenidal gives Bryti a rather pathetic, betrayed look and then promptly buries his face in his hands.  “<small>This is not happeninnnggg.....</small>” </p>
    <p>“Cal’s grace,” Vita says, between giggles. “You’re worse than Mom…” </p>
    <p>The previously stated special ability that Amenidal has is put on display as the almost glowing and very embarrassed dark elf begins to spark slightly.  He does an odd scoot sideways and disappears from the immediate vicinity. </p>
    <p>Smilisca rolls his eyes and mutters something under his breath that might be something akin to “<small>wastin’ magic on bein’ honte, ain’t no better ‘en Ink...</small>”</p>
    <p>“Mais, we’ll find him later to work out yall’s details.  Sounds like yall might need to set up a schedule to share ‘im.”</p>
    <p>“Or maybe just a zone of control he can operate out of, between all factions,” Vita says, tapping her chin. She pauses, and then glances at the River Elf guard. The white haired, clearly-a-Blade-Elf River Elf guard.</p>
    <p>“Wait a minute,” she says, stepping over to Bryti, grinning to herself. “Clever disguise, <i>Tourist</i>, but you won’t slip past Vita Grassforest <i>this time</i>!” She lets out a hearty cackle, and then pulls a somewhat tattered book from her satchel. “You promised me an autograph,” she says, holding it up.</p>
    <p>"Commander Smoke, I am not-" Bryti looks down at her uniform then the book, then lets out a heavy sigh.</p>
    <p>"Curses," she speaks in a low flat voice, "You have seen through my ruse. I am now obligated to fulfill my bargain. What name would you like me to use?" </p>
    <p>“ ‘Tourist’ would be fine,” Vita says. “Or ‘Katya’ maybe. Whichever you think is more you these days.” </p>
    <p>Litoria chuckles.</p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Private Louve<span class="tooltiptext">Wolf, feminine</span></span>, weh?” the Warmaster offers.</p>
    <p>"I like that," Bryti chuckles, "I am, after all, just another soldier today. Would that be acceptable, Commander?" </p>
    <p>“Weh,” Vita says confidently.</p>
    <p>"It's pronounced- Nevermind," Bryti takes the offered book and a quill. She writes in quick strokes.</p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter">To Commander Vita Grassforest</p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter">This humble soldier with a habit of tourism thanks you for your hospitality.</p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter">Pvt. B. Louve</p>
    <p>"Commander," Bryti passes the book back with a salute. </p>
    <p>Vita returns the salute, while grinning like a maniac. </p>
    <p>Embebi, watching this interchange with a mixture of concern and curiosity, apparently makes up her mind about something.  Gulping down the last of her potato, she approaches the gathering a little closer.  “Couldn’t help but overhear… sounded as you made mention that you’re… the Tourist?” she says, pointing a finger at the white-haired elf.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Bryti turns to Embebi, “The Tourist, the Seeker. One and the same.” </p>
    <p>Embebi retracts the finger, instead hooking her thumbs into the sash at her waist, trying(and only partially succeeding) in adopting a cool posture.  She inhales.  “Aff.  That being the case, then, I have to ask… did you kill Echo of Blood?”  There’s no malice to the question… rather, a sort of resigned tiredness.</p>
    <p>"What?" Bryti blinks, "No! Certainly not. That would have taken… days, even if I wanted to. No, we ended our bout with a few words and he stalked off further into town. That's the last I saw of him." </p>
    <p>Embebi exhales heavily.  “I had figured on even odds that he’d run after you for a rematch, but it’s… well, I wish I could say it’s a relief, but more it’s just one less potential disaster.  Unless, mayhap, you’re fabricating, but I figure a kill like that, anyone couldn’t help but brag…”  Her lips quirk.  “...Well, at the very least that’s one scandal I can write off.  Appreciate it.”</p>
    <p>"Of course, sir," Bryti responds with a quick salute, "This is no place for such games. If I knew anything I would tell you." </p>
    <p>Embebi quirks a brow at the salute.  “Neg, neg.  No place for games… just dressup, it seems.  Not sure the reason for that, but I’m not one to judge one’s preferences.  Certainly can’t be towards being unknown, as I figure there’s not an elf in this whole camp, or even in… well, I was to say ‘Lowlands’, but facts as, there’s plenty of Crag as well who know full well what a white-haired elf means now.”  A curious look crosses her face.  “...You know, as long as I’m asking probing questions, may as well settle another curiosity… what in at least four seperate hells even possessed you to do such a thing, anyway?  I know most elves down here must see you as some kind of folk hero, but I know many a Crag who still have nightmares of that day in Eparchy.  Not exactly viewed kindly, folks shaped that way, you ken? “</p>
    <p>"I am not <i>playing dressup</i>," Bryti growls, "I have enlisted in the river elf military in earnest. As to why I attend such events, lowland or otherwise, it is for the same reason that I joined up. I <i>am</i> an elf. I… apologize for the trauma I caused, however. It was not my intent to clash with the Echo of Blood when I entered Crag territory. I lost my temper." </p>
    <p>Embebi holds out her palms in a placating gesture.  “Aff, you say you’re an elf, I’ll agree with you;  it’s not as like I’m any expert on what is and isn’t an elf in the Lowlands.  Truly said, I’m still puzzling over thems that has scales… And further, no harm meant if you’ve fully decided to throw your lot with the Rivers.  Way I see it, you could scarcely choose a better battlefield to avoid being the center of attention than one where The Litoria strides,” she says with a knowing smirk.  “But if I’m gonna pick any part to question, I’d say that what you did wasn’t to <i>lose</i> a temper- damage on that duration and scale, you musta thrown it off a cliff and never looked back.  And the part that has me most curious- over the <i>First Among Scholars</i>, of all Crag.”  </p>
    <p>She rolls her hand.  “Now, I won’t say that he deserved the full of Echo’s ire… but for what he said, he definitely deserved at least a part of it.  So why stick your neck out for his like?” Something in her voice carries the sense that this is not just a question, but a test…</p>
    <p>A dark look comes over Bryti's face for a moment, but it it not directed at Embebi. Instead, it seems aimed at that familiar point in the middle distance that only weary soldiers can see. After a few seconds of fugue, she looks back up to Embebi.</p>
    <p>"I lost everything in the war," she says, "My family, my friends, my order, my entire culture. I know that you suffered immensely during the war, moreso than me, but… Echo still has those things. It is impossible to describe the value of those things, how irreplaceable they are… and even how irritating people like First are part of it. Even more, Echo considers himself an Aggro, a protector of his people. If I had what he still has, I would… treasure it. To see him vent his wrath violently on those he claims to protect, to act so entitled to use his strength to silence those weaker than him, to treat the precious gifts he has so callously, to abuse his family so, makes me absolutely furious." </p>
    <p>Embebi looks… surprised.  Bryti’s answer wasn’t the one she expected… but it’s not one she disagrees with, either.  “...Well… there’s probably about half a dozen things there that I could explain on his behalf, and I ain’t about to.  I don’t owe him that favor, specially not seeing as how he’s apparently gotten confused on which of the two of us is supposed to go running off and getting into mischief.   What I will say is that I’m not in any rush to try and compete with anyone on how much suffering this World’s brought on them.  I already made that mistake once, and I got shown up proper for it.”  She winces at the memory.  </p>
    <p>“...All that said, by all I see and hear, it seems the full truth is that you’re someone whose main concern, sufferingwise, is that the World could stand a little less of it.  And that being so… and because you didn’t kill Echo,” she adds quickly, “then I’m glad to have a warrior like you on our side.”  A little haltingly, she extends one of her hands, clenched into a fist.</p>
    <p>Bryti gives the fist a curious look, then intuits the gesture. She raises her own fist and firmly bumps knuckles.</p>
    <p>"Thank you Commander," Bryti speaks with respect, "But today, I am a single soldier." </p>
    <p>Embebi gives a disbelieving smirk.  “Okay, truechat?  You can probably stand to pull back on the humility a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, single soldier, but facts facts, you’ve got mohs few others are capable of fathoming.  I mean, I’ll grant it might be hard to feel a lord of war next to a <i>literal</i> walking mountain,” she says, pointing a thumb behind her and feeling pretty confident in her odds that it points to some part of Voyager, “but you have to give yourself <i>some</i> credit.  You can’t expect the rest of us to do it all for you.”</p>
    <p>"Would you prefer I indulge a latent desire to rule, dominate, and conquer by demanding an officer's commission, or perhaps take command of an entire army by bloodright?" Bryti inclines her head to Embebi, "Mayhaps demand ownership of a city? It could be a small city. I am more than willing to change my tactics if my commanding officers would prefer." </p>
    <p>Embebi raises an eyebrow, smirk still present.  “...Well, if you wanted to, like as not there’s not a one of us that could stop you… excepting The Litoria, of course,” she says, gesturing with her head. “The real question would be whether you were truly crazy enough to <i>desire</i> such a thing.  I’ll tell true, managing even a part of a city, even one that largely manages itself, is a trial against which I’d rather face any number of fierce warriors.  I’ll grant you’re such a fierce warrior, and deserve recognition as such, but I’m not sure such recognition should be in the shape of <i>daily</i> requisition rituals, quineg?” Her tone is teasing, although a little tiredness slips in at the end there.</p>
    <p>"Truly the burdens of leadership are great," Bryti says, "Thus should only go to those most courageous and daring. I am willing to graciously leave such a great honor to those more capable of such grand endeavors." </p>
    <p>Embebi gives a short, stifled laugh.  “Oh, aff, same, same.  Trouble comes in that those more capable also seem to know better than to accept!  Twisted wisdom, that; helps explain why so often it is the courageous and daring who get stuck with the task.  Way I hear you speak, I’d say it sounds less as though you lack for daring, and more as though you suffer from an excess of sense!” </p>
    <p>“If that is my curse it must have come upon me recently,” Bryti smirks, then frowns slightly, “The truth is… a soldier is all I must be. For me to be anything else would only end in tragedy. If I were to lead and others follow, then no matter how just anyone thinks I am, it would be a call to the old times. The Lycans are gone… and we earned it. All I would do is draw more wrath on our people, just as the wolf elves would. Or worse… I might succeed and others follow, feeling that the world has not changed at all. Thus, I must be a soldier and an elf… at least until someone needs a howl.” </p>
    <p>Embebi’s frown follows Bryti’s.  She shifts her gaze, staring off into the empty nothing.  “...Aff, ack.  I can see there’s a… poor politick to deal with, there.  Reasonable.”  She juts her chin out, thinking.  “...Though, that said… I’d caution you against getting overly fond of the “we’s” there.  Spend enough time trying to lay claim to the transgressions of your kin, and eventually you’ll find someone brash enough to take it at face value.  It’s a poor fit.  Besides… standin on principle as an elf, for all the good it does, but also standin on principle as a… Lycan… for all the bad it does?  Smacks to me of trying to have your goose, but burn it too.”</p>
    <p>"That… is actually a good point," Bryti glances at the assembled elves, "I <i>am</i> both, though. I know it may seem strange, but I consider myself fully an elf and a Lycan. I can't abandon one any more than the other… but guilt is a treacherous companion."</p>
    <p>Bryti sighs, "Perhaps I am so eager to accept guilt and blame because <i>someone</i> should. Someone should acknowledge what was done, and there is no one else left alive…" </p>
    <p>“Aside from a bunch of grateful folks that live for centuries and owe you a favor,” Vita says. “Not to mention a whole pile of humans to the north that’ll be eager to work blaming you into their national culture.” Vita pauses. “General Embebi’s got a point, Private Louve. I think no matter how this turns out, you’ve acknowledged it, and we’ll remembr. And that a good chunk of those that earned that guilt are dead, along with way many more who didn’t.”</p>
    <p>"I…" Bryti pauses. A strange contemplative look comes over Bryti's face. It only lasts for a few moments before she quirks an eyebrow at Vita.</p>
    <p>"I <i>did</i> almost kill your boss once." </p>
    <p>“And yah didn’t,” Vita says. “Besides, way she tells it, it sounded more like a suicide pact.”</p>
    <p>"Ridiculous," Bryti snorts, "Merely a traditional Lycan greeting misunderstood. Next time I shall be far more cognizant of local ordinances, and perhaps I shall avoid unpleasantries with local law enforcement, though I do admit the punishment for avoiding a fine is rather steep."</p>
    <p>“...So Hunger did actually make you pay a fine?” Vita says. “Really thought that was just a rumor.” </p>
    <p>"Of course I paid the fine," Bryti gives Vita a half stare, "Do I seem like some kind of criminal to you? Or worse yet, an <i>adventurer</i>?" </p>
    <p>“I just figured he wouldn’t charge you, since ‘overly-aggressive arresting procedure’ is against one of his own statues,” Vita continued. “Technically the Triumvirate’s supposed to give you money if you can prove they did that. It’s in his own rules and everything.”</p>
    <p>"Ah, that's the pinch," Bryti smirks slightly, "They never managed to arrest me." </p>
    <p>“Doesn’t mean you couldn’t still get ‘em for injuries sustained in the attempt,” Vita says. “But as sole Triumvirate rep currently in the area, I guess I better shut up.”</p>
    <p>"Fortunate timing," Ehra gracefully steps into the conversation, "As I believe the bonfire is almost ready. The river elves seem to be searching for their beacon lighter. You'd better hurry before someone tries to nominate me again." </p>
    <p>“Oh, right,” Vita says nervously. “I agreed to that.” Smoke leaks out of her ears, as she heads over to the bonfire.</p>
    <p>"And what about you, private?" Ehra looks over at Bryti, "Are you still on duty?"</p>
    <p>"No, Sir," Bryti replies smartly, then glances at Litoria, "My Warmaster has seen fit to grant me the evening off."</p>
    <p>"Then you will be joining us at the bonfire? We would be happy to have you."</p>
    <p>"Yes, Sir," Bryti replies with a salute, "Thank you, Grandmaster."</p>
    <p>Bryti turns and walks over to Litoria, who just smiles.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>And there was much dancing.</p>
    <p class="center"><a href="#Top">-FIN-</a></p>
    <h2>Amie Navire II: Amier Navier</h2>
    <p>As the bonfire begins to die down at Amie Navire, the exhausted crowd begins to dissipate. Many return to their armored rafts to prepare for the return of the war in the morning, while others return to duty to relieve those who have kept watch. Litoria and Bryti stay close to the dwindling bonfire, sitting against Sauver and leaning shoulder to shoulder.</p>
    <p>“Thank you for this, Litoria.” Bryti speaks quietly. </p>
    <p>“Weh, I’m glad you came,” Litoria answers.  “We don’t get enough time like this, non?”</p>
    <p>“No we don’t,” Bryti sighs, “It is generally some emergency or another, isn’t it?” </p>
    <p>“Weh, always.”  Litoria leans on Bryti’s shoulder slowly.  “War oughta have ended, right?”</p>
    <p>“Perhaps we should pen a strongly worded note,” Bryti says, “It is certainly an inconvenience. Perhaps they would simply call the whole thing off.” </p>
    <p>“It’s best you write it, then,” Litoria nudges Bryti with an elbow.  “Your penmanship is better ‘en mine, weh?”</p>
    <p>“Perhaps a little,” Bryti laughs. She leans on Litoria a little more and slowly puts an arm around her waist.</p>
    <p>“You are right,” Bryti says a little more seriously, “We don’t get enough time like this.”</p>
    <p>“Mais - what can we do?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” Bryti answers, “I don’t want it to take another war for us to spend time together.”</p>
    <p>“Non, it better not,” Litoria laughs, “or I’ll need to have some strong words with some deities.”  She pauses, and contemplates a moment.  “Weh, I’m sure we can figure somethin’ out.  You’ll always have your duties.”</p>
    <p>“And so will you, Warmaster,” Bryti pauses, “But I did have a home once, and a family. I maintained my duties then, though they may be different now. I often had to be away for long periods of time to fulfill my tasks… but I always came home, for as long as I had a home to come back to. I… would very much like to have a home again, and a family again.” </p>
    <p>“Home is where you are,” Litoria takes Bryti’s hand gently.  “That’s what we done learnt, non?”</p>
    <p>“I have been many places that are not home,” Bryti holds her hand, “But… I agree. Home is where <i>you</i> are.” </p>
    <p>Litoria says nothing for a few minutes, just enjoying the quiet time.</p>
    <p>"Mais, how will it work?"</p>
    <p>Bryti thinks for a few more minutes before replying.</p>
    <p>"I think… I think my duty is changing. I am not sure yet, but I believe that I will have a lot to do in this part of the world. If… maybe if the flotillas are moving about, it would be a good way for me to go from place to place? At the very least, when not specifically performing a task, I could return to the flotilla, instead of just, well, camping in the wild all the time." </p>
    <p>"Non, Bryti, cher!" Litoria feigns surprise, "don't tell me you do not like spending all that time in th' wilderness wi' noone to bother you one bit."  More soberly she adds, "Mais really, Cous’ tells me our raft is gettin' crowded.  Are you sure?"</p>
    <p>"I grew up with three siblings," Bryti replies, "I miss a little chaos sometimes. How bad could it be?"</p>
    <p>The two women share a laugh. Neither of them have any idea.</p>

    <h2 id="Hilt'Inn">Hilt’Inn</h2>
    <p>The Hilt’Inn becomes a bustle of tension at the arrival of the winged and dreamdust divisions.  Captain Kolya maybe looks like he is about to have a nervous breakdown, but he whisks away the prisoners with a full spyhunter guard equipped with silver.  Rooms are made vacant so that the wounded may rest with Lady Vahn and her clergy tending to them.  Despite Shadimon’s insistence that others get the care first, Vahn sees to his wounds personally with a light smack across the back of his head.  Apparently he and Shy could be siblings with that mile long self-sacrificial streak of theirs, funny that.</p>
    <p>Hmyz ends up being an excellent helper and babysitter. </p>
    <p>With everything the various groups of elves have been through, especially the dark elves, Rasputin informs Shyrendora that they will be celebrating the new year, by opening the spas and having a small catered party, open to everyone currently in the Hilt’Inn and Immigration Center. And, of course, any resident dark elves who want to come upstairs. </p>
    <p>Shyrendora finds out about this when Rasputin comes to her office to escort her to the party. She finds herself at a table by one of the enormous public baths, where someone brought her a drink and a plate of snacks.</p>
    <p>Many of the more lightly-wounded winged elves are taking full advantage of the spa. The hot water is an excellent balm for aching muscles, and the humidity is very welcome after the scorching dry of the badlands. Before Shyrendora has been sitting for very long, Shadimon comes to join her, wincing slightly as he sits down. He has several partially healed wounds, and plenty of bruises. He points at the plate on the table, “Going to eat all of that?” </p>
    <p>Still clad in what looks like a rather fancy new uniform, and still very confused about how she got from point A to point B, Shyrendora responds with a slight shake of her head.  “No.  Please feel free, I know you need it and I have already eaten.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon helps himself to some kind of fried...something. Probably mushrooms. Whatever it is, it’s tasty. They sit in silence for awhile, watching the other people enjoying themselves. “New haircut,” Shadimon says finally. “Looks good on you.” </p>
    <p>The tips of her ears gain a light dusting of pink as she attempts to push some of the uneven strands behind one.  “It was a necessity-” she hesitates as if recalling something, “but...thank you.”</p>
    <p>There is silence for a beat or two.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry we were not there to aid you in the battle,” she says abruptly, obviously trying to turn the conversation, “you all arrived pretty banged up.” </p>
    <p>“Not as banged up as they were, at least. You collapsed that tunnel, which gave us a place to pin them. The ambush didn’t go like I’d hoped, but when does a battle plan ever go perfectly.” He glances up at her, “You all have had plenty of fighting yourselves.” </p>
    <p>Shyrendora’s shoulder slump slightly and she fiddles with a bracelet on her wrist.  “We have,” her words are quiet, “I… never want to see what happened in Strieborna happen again.  Not in my lifetime and hopefully not for lifetimes to come.  These wolf elves have to be stopped, no matter what.” </p>
    <p>“They do, and we will.” Shadimon sips his drink, “But...it wasn’t wolf elves you were facing in Strieborna, was it.” He glances from her shorter hair to the stiff way she’s holding her shoulders, “I’m sorry.” </p>
    <p>She gives him a questioning look, “They didn’t deserve what they were suffering, so we did what we could for them.  Why are you sorry?” </p>
    <p>“Greg’s letter was...succinct. He said your father was down there.” He turns the cup on the table, “You don’t have to discuss it, but you can.”</p>
    <p>A muscle in Shyrendora’s jaw twitches as her lips press into a thin line.  She folds her hands together and carefully places them on the table, letting her gaze pull away from the winged elf next to her to stare at some point on a wall.  “Yes.  He was afflicted.  Had been afflicted, in fact, since the war,” she says with a stiff, factual tone, “He fell in with the wolf elves easily enough after that.  I think their mindsets and methods were fairly similar, otherwise his pride would never have allowed such a thing.”</p>
    <p>She hesitates before managing to get out, “I did kill him.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon nods slowly, “I know your relationship with him was...not good, but that must have been awful.” He briefly puts his hand over hers before pulling back. </p>
    <p>Shyrendora doesn’t pull away at the touch, but sighs loudly and attempts to relax her stiff posture.  It doesn’t happen, so she goes for the ever faithful flask on her hip and takes a swig.  She thumps the butt of it on the table and begins to speak.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t.  Not really.  I think, in the end, that was just a different monster wearing his face.”  She pauses then sighs again, “I spent so long hoping he was already dead.  It was easier to push him out of my mind.  Knowing is different.” </p>
    <p>“Gives you a chance to really look up and ahead without worrying about what might be behind you?” Shadimon guesses.</p>
    <p>She laughs dryly, “Yeah, I guess.  Trischal said something similar not that long ago.  Guess you both are on to something and I should probably listen.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon shrugs his wings, “It’s one thing to say, another to go through. Everyone works through things at their own pace. Hells, I’m <i>still</i> uneasy about Coldwater, and it took me weeks to be able to close the damn windows without getting claustrophobic.” He sighs and pushes the plate of snacks back toward her, “Can’t speak for Trischal, but I’m not meaning to push you too much. I just don’t want you to be...I don’t know, all knotted up on your own.</p>
    <p>“I also realized, uh, very recently that it was probably him that I told to fuck off on one of those refugee handoffs…”</p>
    <p>“I’m not- “  Shy pauses to give Shadimon a very confused look, her ears flicking into odd positions.  “You didn’t know?  Huh… I thought you knew.  We look alike.” </p>
    <p>Shadimon laughs quietly, wincing and pressing his hand to his side, “It was <i>dark</i>; I couldn’t see a thing. Just a vague outline of pale and angry.” He pauses, “No wonder he was so taken aback. Now that I actually know what a Domawit is. Probably wasn’t used to people calling him on anything.” </p>
    <p>Grit, passing by, notices the pair of them and detours over to the table.  “Is this a private conversation and food, or free to join?”</p>
    <p>“Ah, Grit, feel free,” Shadimon says. “Have the two of you met? I don’t know how much Singing Sands has been through here.” </p>
    <p>“A few times,” Grit nods to Shyrendora.  “And glad to be back.  The last few months have been rough.”</p>
    <p>Shyrendora offers her a smile, “It is good to see you in one piece.  I heard that the Badlands were…” she makes a face, “Exciting.” </p>
    <p>Grit snorts, plopping down in a chair.  “That’s one word for it, yes.  They were rough even by our standards.  We’ve gotten spoiled by living places with grass.”  </p>
    <p>Shadimon makes a face, “I was only out there for a few weeks and I’ll be shaking sand out of my feathers for days. We’ll happily leave <i>that</i> to you experts.” </p>
    <p>Grit grins broadly at the pair of them, wiggling her eyebrows.  “What, don’t like having grit everywhere?  But we could have such fun.”</p>
    <p>“Hm, I recall getting sand in my gear once on a recon mission to the surface,” the still fully clothed awkward leader of the dark elves muses obliviously.  “I don’t quite remember it being the fun that you state it could be.”</p>
    <p>Noting the obliviousness, Grit snorts.  “That depends on whether it’s sand or <i>Grit</i>.”  She waggles her eyebrows more dramatically, contemplating ways to escalate further if that fails. </p>
    <p>Shadimon snorts into his drink, “I’m seeing that sandstorm on the horizon, and I think it’s too much for me.” He takes a sip and grins, “I’m afraid when it comes to an oasis, I prefer the trees to the well.” </p>
    <p>Grit grins at him, raising her mug with a shrug and an ‘oh well’ sort of gesture.</p>
    <p>Shyrendora glances between her two naked companions.  While her face holds no particular expression other than a small wrinkle on her brow, her ears are doing a confused dance.  “...Why are we speaking of sandstorms?  We are inside and I do not think the storms from the Badlands come so far as to be on the southern side of the Caldera…” </p>
    <p>Shadimon slaps a hand over his mouth just in time to keep from spitting his drink everywhere. He coughs a few times and clears his throat, “Sorry Shyren, thought you were playing along.” </p>
    <p>Grit snorts.  “I was propositioning the both of you.  Perhaps I should be blunter.”  She contemplates for a moment.  “Dust will hate that.”  She grins, then.  “So.  Interested?” </p>
    <p>There is a lot of blinking on Shyrendora’s part as she sits there with both of her hands now clutching to her flask.  “What?” she asks eloquently, the tips of her ears going pink.</p>
    <p>“You, me, bed?  Or wall or something.  I’m not picky about location.  We could examine each others’ tattoos very closely.  Yours are very striking.”  Her eyes trail down Shy’s face, over the sliver of tattoo visible at her neck, and down in a significant manner.</p>
    <p>A creaking noise from the flask in Shy’s hands is the only sound made in response.  Her eyes are round and she looks frozen in place as the pink crawls swiftly from her ears to her cheeks.</p>
    <p>Some kind of shimmer spreads over the outside of her form and Shy promptly vanishes from sight.  There is the softest sound of scuffling to be heard by sharp ears under the other noises and conversations going on around the table.</p>
    <p>“Think that’s a no, Grit,” Shadimon says, straining for composure.</p>
    <p>Grit sighs.  “Damn.  I think that’s a first for someone literally vanishing on me.  Maybe I should have tried to stay more subtle.”  She shrugs.  “Oh well.  Glad to see you’re all patched up, even if I don’t get to check the healer’s work.”  She peers at the food.  “Any idea what that is?” </p>
    <p>“Delicious,” Shadimon says, taking another piece. </p>

    <h2 id="Asavardi">Asavardi</h2>
    <p>While Year’s End is still mostly a holiday celebrated with family and friends, it often turns into a community-wide party. In the week leading up to the last day of the year, tents, pavilions, and other temporary structures started to appear along the top of the cliffs. The holiday market quickly took shape, and the merchants were joined by musicians, dancers, and food vendors. </p>
    <p>“I do love my brother, and Shadimon, but I wish we got to spend more time with just us,” Vatsarava says, bumping her hip against Shrike’s. “Well,” she looks down at the baby in her arms, “mostly just us.”</p>
    <p>“They don’t count yet,” Shrike says dryly. “They’re still noisy furniture at this point.”</p>
    <p>Rava laughs and pats Davarash’s head, “Do you hear the terrible things your mother says about you? Just awful.”</p>
    <p>“Afwa,” Davarash agrees.</p>
    <p>“They’re going to start talking soon, and I bet you a copper it’ll be some kind of profanity,” Shrike laughs.</p>
    <p>“Not taking a bet I know I’ll lose.”</p>
    <p>The walkways and ladders in the canyon are festooned with greenery; the hanging gardens get more lush with each year that goes by, and many of the climbing vines have been trained along the paths. The market area is full of people coming and going, and intriguing sounds and smells. Both babies perk up, wiggling excitedly at all the activity. </p>
    <p>The two women let the twins decide where to go, taking directions from small pointing fingers and waving fists. They peruse everything from worked copper to shaped glass to clothing. One of the pavilions contains a toy-maker, to the endless delight of the twins. The proprietor is very indulgent of his tiny clients, solemnly identifying each item they point at.</p>
    <p>“Dreamdust cloth for those, stuffed with down. People-down, just like yours. Oh or perhaps that? Carved pine. That one is a Vaquero idea, actually. Little horse on wheels.” </p>
    <p>One of the twins points at a carved bird, and Shrike laughs and shakes her head, “No way, I see that whistle, and they do <i>not</i> need that. But they seemed to agree on the stuffed…fish. Really you two? Not the rabbit or the bird or the horse, but the fish?”</p>
    <p>The owner grins, leaning on the counter, “I asked my kids for suggestions. I figure they know better than we adults do, and your little ones seem to agree!”</p>
    <p>Rava snorts and hands one of the fish to Davarash, “Definitely two though, please. They’ll agree for now, but the poor fish would end up drawn and quartered without backup.”</p>
    <p>Fish safely in hand and being chewed on, Shrike and Rava take their chance to get some food. An entire section of the market has been dedicated to food-sellers, and they wander through trying small samples and collecting a basket full of things. Just as they’re finishing, at the end of the row they find a confectioner. The cloth draped over the table proclaims is Sticky Fingers Sugar Shop, a new shop that had only recently opened and was usually so packed you couldn’t get in. </p>
    <p>There is indeed a crowd at the booth, but a large group of them seem to be together and their leaving clears a path to the front. The counter is filled with trays and bowls of shaped candies, and shelves hold jars of honey, boxes of brittles, and candied nuts, fruits, and flowers.</p>
    <p>“Oh this is <i>dangerous</i>,” Shrike says, not bothering to hide the awe in her voice. </p>
    <p>“Like an unexpected downdraft,” the owner agrees. “Care for some samples? We’ve got all kinds of things depending on your tastes.”</p>
    <p>Rava and Davarash are peering at a display of candies molded in intricate shapes. “How do you do this? These are amazing!”</p>
    <p>“Wax molds! Make a shape, usually out of wood - got a sister who’s a carver - then press it into warm wax to make the shapes, then pour in the candy when it’s just cool enough to not melt the wax.” She pushes over a clay bowl, “Most of them are honey-based, with different fruit juices mixed in. We also cook some down into jellies. Dusted with a little sugar or fruit and nuts, they’re a great treat.”</p>
    <p>She gestured to another tray, “We have sugar-sticks and brittles made from crystalized honey too. Close to rock candy, but a bit less tough on the teeth.”</p>
    <p>“What do you think, Shrike? A few of the hard candies for us and the jelly ones for the boys?”</p>
    <p>“Done. Oh, and one of the sugar-sticks too, please. We can take it to Thari.”</p>
    <p>“Oh good idea.”</p>
    <p>With the wrapped package of candies added to their trove, the two of them detour back toward the crafter’s booths. Tathariel has been drafted among the other leather-workers, and has his hands tangled in stitching when they arrive. </p>
    <p>“Thari! Brought you some fuel!”</p>
    <p>He looks up, “You’re a life-saver. What’ve you got?”</p>
    <p>“That new candy place has a booth and-”</p>
    <p>“Ba! Bababa!”</p>
    <p>Tathariel laughs, leaning over to greet the twins, “Yes, I’ve missed you too. Did you pick out whatever I get to eat?”</p>
    <p>“No, but they picked themselves toy fish.” Rava holds out the sugar, dyed a cheerful blue, “Plum flavor, she said, but it’s blue and I like blue.” </p>
    <p>Still with his hands full, he leans over and takes it with his teeth. “Ahnk oo!”</p>
    <p>Snack delivered, they make their way to one of the seating areas, close to where a few musicians are performing. They spread their bounty out on the table, sharing between themselves and the twins. The babies are gleefully enjoying their adventures into solid foods, but the candy is clearly beyond their experience. After begging for more and a brief tantrum when no more is forthcoming, they finally settle and are distracted by the nearby dancing.</p>
    <p>After a little while of watching the dancing as well, Rava glances over at Shrike. “It’s ok to be worried, you know.”</p>
    <p>Shrike glances up, “What? Oh. Hells was it that obvious?”</p>
    <p>Rava scoops up Davarash and moves to sit beside her, “I like to think I know you a little bit by now. You’re a little quieter than usual, but of <i>course</i> you would worry. You’ve loved Shadi for most of your life, and he’s off getting into trouble without you.” She leans her shoulder against Shrike’s, “You know better than me and Thari what’s going on out there. We never saw fighting.”</p>
    <p>Shrike leans into her, resting her head against Rava’s. “I’m afraid,” she says. “That I’ll lose some of the family I’ve just been getting back. Shadi, Breaker, hells even Terror. They’re going to be in the thick of things, where the fighting is hottest.”</p>
    <p>“They’re all very good at what they do, at least?”</p>
    <p>“They are, but that also makes them targets. Take out one of them, and you land a solid blow against those people and our alliance in general. To morale, if not tactical capability.” She shrugs uneasily, “The wolf elves know that, just like the Lycans did. It’s just...I don’t like being powerless. I’m not <i>there</i>.”</p>
    <p>Rava frees an arm out from under Davarash and slips it around Shrike’s waist, under her wings. They sit together quietly for a moment, and then Shrike adjusts the sash holding Kailash to her. “That’s enough of that. Come on, let’s teach the boys how to dance.”</p>

    <h2 id="Field Hospital">Field Hospital</h2>
    <p>Mercy Field is a buzz of activity. The casualties began to come in practically the moment the temporary buildings were brought up. Wounded fire elves are the bulk of the patients, with the vast majority being militia from the Expansionary Guard who suffered greatly during the breakthrough, but there are plenty of other elves.</p>
    <p>The hospital is far from overwhelmed, but it is still a frenzy of activity on the new year. It is a significant stress test of Matias’ newly rebuilt Followers of Saint Errigal. Thankfully, they seem up to the task. Careful planning and management of supplies has made this possible, but so has the healing power of a few members.</p>
    <p>As the sun starts to set on the last day of the year, Matias and Baijani step out of one of the isolation tents. Matias carefully closes the tend flaps and begins to clean blood from his hands in the basin of rose scented holy water near the entrance, cleansing miasma from him before moving on.</p>
    <p>"She’ll recover,” he speaks as he washes, “She’s strong, and the wound is already weeping. It’s frustrating that the wound has festered so badly. We have to figure out a more efficient way to seal a wound on a fire elf, I can’t believe I didn’t think that cauterization won’t work on them. Their fire baths seem to burn away miasma, but the wound is still left vulnerable. I think we’re going to manage this time, but we’re going to need a solution. This won’t be the last fire elves we treat. Uh, Baijani, do you  know how many more patients I have today? I lost track.” </p>
    <p>“That was the last one. Everyone else has it in hand, so please, for Mother’s sake, take a break.” She smiles, “I know the tendency to work until you fall over, but we all need to rest when we can, so we’ll be ready. Come have a meal, yes?”</p>
    <p>"Oh," Matias blinks and looks up at the sky, "It's evening, isn't it? Well… si, you're right. I imagine things are going to get worse before they get better. It will do not good to burn myself out in the first two weeks we're running. I had better learn to pace myself. Si yeah, let's go get something to eat." </p>
    <p>Baijani hides a grin as she leads the way toward one tent slightly off to the side. This one is set aside for the healers, and a few attendants make sure there’s always some kind of food and drink available. Matias gets a surprise when he follows Baijani inside and finds that the inevitable pot of stew has been augmented by a modest spread of festival food. A stack of flatbread is sitting beside platters of grilled meats and vegetables, the same things that usually go into the stew, but based on the smell, someone concocted an assortment of sauces. </p>
    <p>The true achievement, however, is a plate of small pastries, topped with fruit and sugar. The cooks on duty glance up and don’t bother hiding their grins at Matias’ stunned expression.</p>
    <p>“Happy Year’s End, son,” Baijani says, patting him on the shoulder. </p>
    <p>Matias blinks, then laughs.</p>
    <p>"I had almost forgotten," he says, "Thank you, Baijani. Everyone's spirits doubtlessly need this." </p>
    <p>“Absolutely. Come sit, they said they had something special set aside for you.”</p>
    <p>"They did?" Matias allows himself to be guided to a chair, "I didn't think-"</p>
    <p>Matias is interrupted by an almost comically large pastry nearly coated in sugar. Matias laughs, and attempts to conquer it. The potluck is a simple one, but a welcome one. The healers badly need the cheer, especially one.</p>
    <p>A short while into the dinner, Sirii approaches the table where Matias and Baijani sit. She's wearing a pin that denotes a volunteer, and quite unusually is not wearing any kind of sword.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Sirii," Matias smiles, "I did not know you were here. Is the Grandmaster visiting us?"</p>
    <p>"No," Sirii sighs, "Mind if I sit? I'd like to talk."</p>
    <p>"Go ahead," Matias nods, "I understand that carrying a sword is important to blade elves, but the rules-"</p>
    <p>"I threw my sword into a ditch outside Alfyr," Sirii says as she sits, causing Matias to pause, "That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I can't do that any more."</p>
    <p>"Do what?" Matias asks.</p>
    <p>"This whole… <i>thing</i> that Ehra is doing," Sirii says with a sigh, "I love him, yeah, he's a grandfather to all of us… but… but now, we're just doing it again. He <i>says</i> we're soldiers by choice and not slaves anymore, but still, all young blade elves are trained to fight and kill, fight and die. He makes these speeches where he talks about service and sacrifice, and I see the looks in the eyes of our young soldiers, and I feel <i>sick.</i></p>
    <p>He says never again, and that there will always be a need for soldiers, and that we must carry the torch, and they all believe in it to their core. I see all these… these <i>kids</i> ready, <i>eager</i> to die, and I can't shake the feeling that we're just starting the cycle again. I can't do it. I can't be part of that cycle of death again, even if he's right. <i>Especially</i> if he's right."</p>
    <p>Baijani reaches over and puts her hand over Sirii’s.</p>
    <p>"I'm done with war," Sirii looks between the two healers, "I'm done with swords and I'm done with killing. I would like to join the followers of Saint Errigal."</p>
    <p>"Of course you can," Matias says, "But the oaths you swear are permanent, and you will live a long time. I know this might cause problems for you in blade elf society as well. Are you certain?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Sirii answers with confidence, "It <i>should</i> cause problems in blade elf society. Maybe it'll make one or two elves think about what we're doing. I've been thinking about it a long time. Every time I look at a sword I feel sick. I'm done."</p>
    <p>"Okay," Matias nods, "There isn't much ceremony. Followers stand less on ceremony and more on principles. If you will work alongside me for a few days, I will tell you about our values and our oaths. If you're still confident about it after that, I'll induct you myself. Will that work?"</p>
    <p>Sirii nods.</p>
    <p>"Then sit and eat for now," Matias smiles, "One of our oaths is 'heal thyself,' you can't help anyone else if you yourself are a mess. Just relax a little for now, si?"</p>
    <p>“First duty of a healer,” Baijani says with a grin, “is don’t become one of the casualties.”</p>
    <p>"Sure," Sirii sighs and pulls off a piece of pastry, "Weak acid, by the way."</p>
    <p>"Hm?" Matias emotes.</p>
    <p>"Sealing a wound on a fire elf," Sirii explains, "Your followers told me you've been having issues with that. Dilute acid in pure water, And it'll burn the wound closed even on a fire elf. Have to get it just right, though. I can show you."</p>
    <p>"Si," Matias smiles, "Later. Eat now."</p>
    <p>Sirii nods again and starts eating quietly. The dinner goes well, lifting spirits throughout the camp. As it turns out, Sirii does indeed make a good Follower of Saint Errigal.</p>

    <h2 id="Fort Alfyr">Fort Alfyr</h2>
    <p>At Fort Alfyr, the mood is tense. The newly trained soldiers have set out to the front and the recruits hold the line. Alfyr has a steady hum of activity as blade elf support personnel prepare supply deliveries for the front. Nearly everyone has a loved one deployed in the line of duty. Knowing losses have already occured, they are worried.</p>
    <p>When Envoyer arrives near the end of the year, they provide some much needed cheer. The river elves are a regular sight at Alfyr, so when the river elves propose a bonfire everyone agrees. It takes place just outside Alfyr’s gates, under the watchful eyes of the reservist guards. Blade elves slowly begin celebrating guiding in good fortune as the bonfire is lit and food is laid out.</p>
    <p>And, in the evening, Acris looks for his friends, along with his two high value teenagers.</p>
    <p>“This is such a strange ritual,” Lucinia grumbles as she looks at the bonfire and pulls a hood over her telltale ears, “Is it not a tactical mistake to light a beacon declaring you are celebrating, and therefore your defenses are weakened?” </p>
    <p>“Nah,” Cel says, stepping up to the wandering teens, still dressed in an official Blade Elf guard uniform. “It’s more like saying ‘yeah, our defenses look weaker, but they’ll still kick your butt.’ Also, you can jump in it if you get hurt.”</p>
    <p>“Oh it’s you,” Lucinia gives Cel a look over, “They allow you to play pretend soldier?” </p>
    <p>“Yep!” Cel beams. “Pretend guard post and everythin’. Already pretending my way up through the ranks; I figure another month, and they’ll give me command of something, on account of all the butts I’ve kicked along the way.”</p>
    <p>“Impressive,” Lucinia notes, “I’ll make sure to send my congratulations to the latrine once you’re granted its command duties.”</p>
    <p>“It probably won’t thank you, because I’ll be loading it into a catapult,” Cel says. “Pwoof! Bam! Right onto an enemy division!” She gives Acris a careful look, and then turns back to Luci. “So since you’re not currently doused, I’ve gotta assume you’re doin’ a bit better, right? Little less pushing other people around, little more grousing?”</p>
    <p>"I'm <i>fine</i>," Luci huffs.</p>
    <p>“Perfect!” She turns to Acris, and pulls a quill out of a side satchel. “Hey, Acris, hold this for me until Terje asks you for it back, please.” </p>
    <p>“Weh?”  Acris accepts the quill and makes an attempt to hide the hand-off.  It goes about as well as one might assume.  “Why’m I doing this again?  Mais, ain’t like I can git in more trouble, but it’d be good to know what for, weh?”</p>
    <p>Cel waves a hand. “You won’t get in trouble; he’ll know I’m the one that handed it off to you. ‘Sides, at this point I think Terje’d be worried if I stopped hiding his stuff. The distraction’s good for him; keeps him from worrying.”</p>
    <p>“That’s real nice of you, Cel,” Acris answers solemnly, “I’m for shore glad you done stayed here over winter.  Are you gon’ come with us to the Hilt’Inn?”</p>
    <p>“Can’t this season,” Cel says. “I’ve got a job to do here first. The war’ll probably be over in a few months, though; I’ll catch up with the rest of you then.” </p>
    <p>Acris tucks the quill away with his various spell components.</p>
    <p>“That’s fair - your job’s more important by far, weh.”  The apprentice wizard nods understandingly.</p>
    <p>“Your job’s important too,” Cel says, propping herself against a nearby wall. “How’s wherever it is you guys hide out all winter? And the rest of the gang, for that matter?” </p>
    <p>“There she is, Boots! Go get her!” Cel has just enough time to brace before an exuberant hippopotamus cannons into her, grunting gleefully.</p>
    <p>Darsi jogs up behind, grinning, and carrying a bag full of assorted vegetables for treats. “She knew something was going on, and she’s been looking for you all day!” He pats Boots’ side, and is completely ignored, before looking back at the others. “Hi Acris! Good to see you again! Hi to you too, Lucinia. Nobody is-” He stops and looks around, “Um, Nobody was behind me…” </p>
    <p>“Boots hi stop licking my face so I can ta--blaguh!” Cel says, as she is gently crushed by a grunting hippo.</p>
    <p>“See,” a quiet voice chimes in frome close by, “She’s the worst cat.”</p>
    <p>Shady pokes her head out from somewhere behind Acris with a slight grin. Lucinia’s eyes go wide briefly.</p>
    <p>“You do exist…” she grumbles. </p>
    <p>“Shady! I was hoping you would come!” Darsi grins and pats his bag, “I’ve got a handful of letters if you’d like to answer some with me again.”</p>
    <p>“I would,” Shady steps around Acris cautiously. It has been some time since anyone has seen her, which she does not explain.</p>
    <p>“It just looks, I don’t know,” Eyeswith trots along beside her giving Boots a snooty look, “More <i>rubbery</i> than you’d want in a cat.” </p>
    <p>“It’s ‘cause she’s got a thick hide, like a dragon or a catoblepas,” Cel says, prying Boots off of her with a root vegetable from Darsi. “So she’s more like a catoblepas-cat, just like you’re a shadow-cat. Which makes her a double-cat, compared to your single-cat status. She outranks you.”</p>
    <p>“Shows what you know,” Eyeswith makes a sniffing noise, “No one outranks a cat, <i>especially</i> other cats.” </p>
    <p>Clutching a small paper sack, Nobody plods into range of the firelight.  There’s a place on her face where a smile should be, if she had managed to master such a thing yet.  Her eyes scan across the assembled teenagers.  “..Oh, and Shady is here too.  Hello.”</p>
    <p>“<small>That’s only because cats aren’t smart enough to have hierarchies</small>,” a nasal voice says quietly, from somewhere around Luci’s pocket.</p>
    <p>“Absolutely correct,” Lucinia grumbles. </p>
    <p>“Nobody! I was starting to worry you’d gotten lost,” Darsi laughs. “What did you find?” </p>
    <p>Nobody nods, and reaches into the paper sack, slowly extracting not one, not two, but <i>four</i> sticks of red river elf rock candy.  Held together, it looks to be an intimidating candy morningstar.</p>
    <p>“...I wanted to try something this time.  You have all been very generous, and demonstrated and invited me into your cultures and traditions.  I thought I might attempt to share a Crag tradition this time.  Although I have had to… adapt it, somewhat.</p>
    <p>Although they do not celebrate it, as such, the Crag do recognize the turn of a new year with a tradition, of sorts.  It is called ‘The Passing of Charms’.  Through it, one usually gives ones fellows a charm, typically in the form of a symbol of significance to their bloodline… Spades for an Onagi, Clubs for an Aggro, Stars a Bakshish, so forth.  It is said to be a way of granting them good fortune in the coming year.”</p>
    <p>She gestures at the bundles of sugar. “Typically, a charm is willed or carved of stone… but as I am still working to develop my will, I thought it might work to use a less… stubborn substance.  Sugar, I believe, is very pliable and suggestible. It even seems to wish to change shape when not bid to.  And so, I was thinking I might try to make some charms, in shapes significant to you… although, I could use some advice as to what that would be.”</p>
    <p>Darsi claps his hands, “We do the same thing! Well, sort of. Giving charms to people.” He digs in the bag he’s carrying, sending some veggies flying, “Which I forgot to bring with me. I’ll get them later. Hmm, for us, feathers are a pretty standard symbol for just about anything.” </p>
    <p>“A sword,” Cel says automatically. </p>
    <p>Acris looks between Shady and Lucinia and then decides to answer diplomatically.</p>
    <p>“Mais that leaves a cat for Shady, an’ a lucky rabbit’s foot for Lucinia.”  He smiles at Nobody.  “An’ I guess for me a spell book, non?”</p>
    <p>"She has four," Lucinia states flatly, "Not five."</p>
    <p>“I’m sure we can go find a fifth one,” Darsi says, smiling hesitantly.</p>
    <p>“Ah, yes, to signify all the good I’ve done for you,” Lucinia folds her arms, “I’m not your friend.”</p>
    <p>Acris shrugs.  One of these days he’ll develop a sprain in that shoulder or something.</p>
    <p>“You don’t have to be friends, non,” he shakes his head for emphasis, “mais - we’re all gon’ be roommates if’n you already forgot.”</p>
    <p>“I…” Lucinia glances at him, “I guess that is true. Still, there’s no reason to make exceptions for me. Share in your tradition. I’m fine.” </p>
    <p>“<small>And sugar is organic, so it most likely cannot be shaped,</small>” Luci’s pocket-voice says. “<small><i>Bigby’s Carbonic Bond</i> states that the element <i>organos</i>, meaning ‘has organs’, is only susceptible to effects that dictate its shape when...</small>” </p>
    <p>Darsi leans in, ears flicking forward, “What is that? Do you have a familiar too?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Lucinia sighs, “I have a freeloader.”</p>
    <p>Lucinia digs in her pocket and unearths the tiny clockwork dragon. She holds out Beucephalus as he continues to ramble about sugar. </p>
    <p>After another second of exposure to air, Beucephalus pauses and turns his snout to face Luci. “I thought we had agreed that I am a state secret, and should be kept hidden at all times,” he says indignantly.</p>
    <p>“You’re the third state secret currently present,” Luci says, “Deal.” </p>
    <p>Beuce rolls his eyes (with a very distinct ticking sound). He turns and gives the group a once-over. “Greetings, assembled children and pets,” he says. “I am Beucephalus, homunculus to the Hunger, state secret of Surt, and emergency Triumviratorial epitaph. In other words, exceedingly uninteresting. Please proceed with your normal sugar consumption activities.” </p>
    <p>“Why’re you a state secret?” Cel asks, hauling the front half of Boots onto her lap.</p>
    <p>“That would be a secret, by definition,” Beuce says. “Please forward any further questions to the Surtian Post Office, addressed to ‘the Hunger.’ ” </p>
    <p>“How’d you end up with <i>her</i>?” Cel says.</p>
    <p>“People actually <i>like</i> her,” Beuce says. “And she knows how to follow instructions. No more questions.”</p>
    <p>"Yes, he is always like this," Luci sighs and gently pets the mechanical creature's head. </p>
    <p>Temporarily distracted by the clockwork marvel, Nobody returns her attention to the task at hand.  She seems to be putting a great deal of focus into the sugarsticks, eyeing them intensely.  However, a thought occurs to her.</p>
    <p>“...It had not occurred to me previously, but… would Eyeswith or… um… Bosephallus, desire a charm as well?  I do not know if you would consider me your friend, but you are intelligent entities.  Gander tells me I need to be more aware of the desires of such.” </p>
    <p>“Beucephalus,” Beuce corrects mildly, leaning into Luci’s fingers. “And thank you, but I do not consume… <i>sugar.</i> Or anything else, really; I’m a self-stabilizing reaction.” </p>
    <p>Nobody blinks.  “Ah.  Gander did not desire one for the same reason.  Evidently physical manifestations of the vital energies of the world don’t require sugar either.  Do cats?” she asks, trying to spot Eyeswith.</p>
    <p>“... Yes.” Eyeswith responds confidently after a pause, “Sure do! Sugar. Yep. Love sugar.”</p>
    <p>“I can’t eat it,” Shady says quietly, “So… Eyeswith can. I… really like it though.” </p>
    <p>“Cats are carnivorous,” Beuce says. “They don’t eat sugar.” </p>
    <p>Nobody nods, mostly to herself.  “Then, whomever gets it, a cat seems fine.  Right.  Now…”  She grips the stems tightly, bringing the sugar crystals into close contact.  Placing her thumb at the base of one of the blocks of sugar, she closes her eyes.  “...when I saw something like this done before, the key was to make the desired shapes, separated by thin stems, so it may all be done at once.  My hope is the dowel will make that easier…”  </p>
    <p>Her brow furrows in concentration.  She clasps her free hand over the one in contact with the sugarsticks.  Illuminated in the dim firelight, a small sheen of sweat appears on her brow… and the sugar begins to ooze.  Congealing into a single large blob, it begins to ripple, stretching out, small, primitive shapes appearing at regular intervals along the connected dowels.  For a brief moment, the shape of a sword and a book can be observed at opposite ends.</p>
    <p>That is when everything begins to flow...  backwards.  The whole mass begins to congeal into a single oblong clump of sugar.  Nobody scrunches her face, and manages to begin stretching it out again…  and then there is an audible poof noise.</p>
    <p>Cracking one eye open, Nobody observes as both her hands seem to be buried inside a curious, fluffy mass of sugar strings, solidified in the moment of rapid explosion. Made up of extremely fine strands, the sugar has more than tripled in volume, looking akin to a red cloud.</p>
    <p>“...Cats are difficult to visualize,” she says in a quiet voice.</p>
    <p>Darsi cautiously reaches out and pokes the mass of sugar, staring at the fluffy blob that sticks to his fingers. “You <i>can</i> do it though, and you definitely made <i>something</i> interesting.” His eyes light up as he tries the small sample he has, “And it’s <i>delicious</i>.” </p>
    <p>“...Something…” she says, staring at the fluff covering her hands.  “... it looks like… Acris, do you recall that reed you showed me?  Where you pulled at it, and it erupted into fluff?  I think it was called… a cat-tail.” She blinks.  “I think the idea might have gotten conflated while I was concentrating.  I was trying to make a candy cat… instead, I have made cattail candy.  Hrm.”  </p>
    <p>“Hmm,” Beuce says. “I stand corrected.”</p>
    <p>“Think we’ve found a new worst cat, Eyeswith,” Cel says, glancing at the shadow-cat. Eyeswith makes a small <i>hmph</i> noise. </p>
    <p>“But you can eat this one,” Darsi says, grinning and snitching another small piece. </p>
    <p>Nobody gives her hands a couple experimental tugs, but seems to be having some difficulty.  Looking to the others, she bears a plaintive expression.   “I… may need some assistance.”  She proffers her hands, and by extension the poofy mass encasing them, to those who have not yet partaken. </p>
    <p>Cel reaches up and pries a chunk off of Nobody’s hands, dropping a tiny piece for Boots before shoving the rest towards her mouth. The candy melts on her fingertips, running down as droplets of smoking syrup. The chunk slides from her fingers; she manages to just barely juggle it between her hands long enough to get it to her mouth, whereupon it instantly liquifies into a sticky, pasty caramel blob, all over her face and uniform. </p>
    <p>“Weh,” Cel says sardonically.</p>
    <p>"Typical degeneracy," Lucinia snorts, "You can't even- <i>hey!</i>"</p>
    <p>Lucinia whirls around, grabbing Shady by the wrist.</p>
    <p>"What are you doing, you strange creature?" She barks, raising a fist on reflex.</p>
    <p>Shady offers a nervous smile full of sharp teeth. She slowly opens a hand revealing a piece of the proffered puffy candy.</p>
    <p>"I can't have any," Shady says, "So…"</p>
    <p>Lucinia looks at Shady for a moment, then releases her and lowers her hand. She stares at the candy a moment, then snatches it up and pops it in her mouth. She glances around the group.</p>
    <p>"Itha very high energy food," Luci says with a mouth full of candy, "Pure tactical choice. Nothing more." </p>
    <p>“It would be <i>really</i> popular in Asavardi because of that,” Darsi nods. “I don’t think rock candy has caught on yet. Hey Acris, that could be something to suggest the next time Partager is that way.” He helps Nobody pull her hands apart, helping himself to another handful of candy in the process. “Might have to lick it off, Nobody, and just wash your hands later.”  </p>
    <p>Nobody nods.  As she flexes her fingers, they crinkle and crack, small flakes of sugar chipping off.  She stares at them intently, seeming conflicted.</p>
    <p>Cel glances over at Acris. “Acris… you can cast something that cleans things, right? Please? Except not the water spell. Please not the water spell.” </p>
    <p>Acris doesn’t have any spells that could potentially remove sugar residue that aren’t water spells.</p>
    <p>And to that note, he gives an embarrassed smile and wiggles his fingers through the incantation for <span class="AcrisMagic">Drench</span>.  His aim is getting better, he doesn’t even get it in Cel’s hair.</p>
    <p>Cel shivers. “I really hate this spell,” she says, frowning. She pries a bit of syrup from the front of her uniform. </p>
    <p>“Mais, I’m sorry, Cel,” Acris tries his best to be helpful.  “I ain’t learn’t prestigit- presticig- prestiditititit- prestidigitation yeah, that’s right, that spell, yet.”</p>
    <p>“Pressdigits, right,” Cel says, trying and failing to hide significant discomfort under a veneer of ‘badass’. “I’ll remember to ask ‘bout that first, next time.”</p>
    <p>“It’s <span class="ShadyMagic">Prestidigitation</span>,” Shady comments with another toothy smile as she finishes the brief incantation, causing a few cool shadows to roll over Cel and remove the offending sticky pieces. </p>
    <p>“Thank you, Shady,” Cel says. “...Could you get the water, too? It just kind of sucks the heat out from me, you know?”</p>
    <p>Shady nods and holds the spell a little longer, drying out Cel's clothes. When she's done, she pulls the spell back to her hand and absently rolls the shadows around her fingers, making small illusory shapes. Her grin continues.</p>
    <p>“Oh, hey, shadow puppets!” Cel says. She pauses, and glances over at Nobody. “You know… with your shadow puppets, Nobody’s… sugar puppets, and Acris’… water puppets -- you’ve got water puppets, right, Acris? -- we’ve got all kinds of a puppet show.” </p>
    <p>“Sugar puppets…” Nobody quietly repeats, crinkling her hands some more.  After staring a little longer, she shakes her head.  “...In truth, perhaps it would be preferable if you could cleanse my palms as well, Shady.  I have learned that it is not… wise for me to imbibe an excess of sugar…” She sounds conflicted. </p>
    <p>“Mais, Nobody!  It’sa holiday.  You should have the treat you made, weh!”  Acris attempts to be encouraging.</p>
    <p>“At least a little,” Darsi agrees. “Doesn’t hurt your teeth like regular candy.”</p>
    <p>"Should eat it," Shady says, "You can." </p>
    <p>Spurred on by the legion of bad influences, Nobody’s already strained willpower gives out.  Methodically, she begins chewing and scraping at the clump of sugar attached to her digits.</p>
    <p>"Hmph!" Lucinia snorts and folds her arms, "How typically childish."</p>
    <p>A quick glance at Lucinia makes it immediately obvious that she has somehow gotten sticky sugar goop in her ear fur, which has now adhered quite securely to the side of her head.</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>Fort Alfyr has taken to holding bonfires in the river elf tradition. With Envoyer docked, it’s a larger celebration than usual. The new year's celebration stretches down the Goldfall, with the first bonfire lit near the gates of the fort. This year, there is only one candidate present for who lights the fire.</p>
    <p>Welcoming new life, bringing back the lost Behemoths, helping return the hippos to the river elves, and playing a critical role in keeping communications going, Eina has accomplished amazing things in the past year. She has grown from a lone lost cleric to a central figure in the preservation and recovery of river elf culture. There is no one else better suited to light the beacon for a new year.</p>
    <p>Eina touches the torch to the base of the bonfire and steps back as it slowly spreads. She takes a few paces back and stands next to Terje, who passes Nastua back to her with a smile.</p>
    <p>“Thanks Eina,” he says, “I’m glad we were able to get this together. We’re gonna need all the luck we can get.”</p>
    <p>“Ain’t that the truth,” she says smiling quietly, “we’re all wishin’ for ‘em to come home soon.  It’ll happen how it needs to, weh.”</p>
    <p>“It will,” Terje sighs, “There’s no way to stop the worry, and I don’t think I’d want to. At least he has sending…” Terje thumbs the ring hanging around his neck.</p>
    <p>Eina gives Terje a sideways hug while keeping the infant’s hands away from the shiny dangly thing on his neck.</p>
    <p>“Thanks,” Terje sighs, “By the way, have you seen my quill?”</p>
    <p>As the beacon lights, the dancing begins. </p>
    <p>Darsi dives into the crowd, a colorful blur of more enthusiasm than coordination. “Come on! Who wants to come dance with me!” </p>
    <p>“Sure! Wait up!” Cel says. She shoves her way through to Darsi, and commences dancing with aplomb. </p>
    <p>Nobody stares into the flames, watching the dancing forms with her usual mild expression.  At first, she shows little indication that she intends to join… however, a thought seems to occur to her.  Sidling through the crowds on the sidelines, she finds her quarry soon enough.</p>
    <p>“Acris,” she begins, “...as I was not likely to be inducted into the Aggro, I was given no experience in the Art of Dance.  Previously, I had believed that this should exclude me, as I did not wish to disrespect your traditions with a poor showing… but perhaps such thinking is short sighted.  If I do not attempt to learn, I will never show anything other than a poor showing.  So… Could you instruct me in how to dance, as a River does?”  Though her speech is even, as it usually is, there is some hesitance in her request. </p>
    <p>“Weh!  Everyone done dance at them big festivals!”  Acris takes both of Nobody’s solidly grey hands in his webbed pair.  “<span class="tooltip">Allons danser!<span class="tooltiptext">Let's dance!</span></span>”  While he said that everyone does dance, he never suggested that <i>he</i> danced well.</p>
    <p>However, it is not as though Nobody has any particular idea of what a poor dance is.  Enthusiastically, but gracelessly, she does what she can to follow Acris’ lead.  What she lacks in skill or ability, however, she makes up for in sheer endless energy. And Acris is having a wonderful time.</p>
    <p>Someone else is also having a good time. No one was really expecting her to participate, but Shady dances. She moves in her own strange dance, still to the beat of the music but with eerily odd movements. She also appears to have chosen to show off a little, as her dance partner is a vaguely humanoid shape made of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dancing-darkness/" target="_blank">illusory shadow</a>. She draws a few looks, but seems to be enjoying herself.</p>
    <p>Lucinia, however, remains to the side with arms folded. </p>
    <p>Cel spots Luci standing around, and extricates herself from the current dance-mass to march over. “Lemme guess -- dancing’s too undisciplined and degenerate for a ‘proper strong warrior’ or somethin’?”</p>
    <p>“Precisely,” Lucinia states, “I haven’t… nevermind.  I’m fine. Go have fun. I have suffered enough mockery at your hands.” </p>
    <p>“I don’t think I’ve been mocking you,” Cel says. “Arguing with you, maybe. Probably been a bit of a jerk; I’ll admit, I’m kinda that, often enough.” She pauses. “Don’t suppose I’ll convince you if I say it’s good training for reflexes? No one’s gonna judge you for it; most of us aren’t exactly the judging type.”</p>
    <p>“I seem to remember you judging fairly harshly with a boat oar,” Lucinia snorts, “You just want me to come out there so you can make me look bad again, or just trip me. I won’t fall for it.” </p>
    <p>“Nah, I was judging you for tossing Darsi and being a git,” Cel says, rolling her eyes. “The boat oar was unrelated.”</p>
    <p>Lucinia looks up at the dancing crowd, then back to Cel.</p>
    <p>“He touched me. I don’t like being touched,” Lucinia admits, “And… you’ll make me look bad whether you want to or not. I have not danced since I was a little kid.” </p>
    <p>“Darsi’s a huggy person -- lotsa flappies are apparently -- but he should have asked,” Cel says. Her eyes flash. “So tell you what. <i>I’ll</i> dance with you. That way, if anyone looks bad, it’ll be me -- at least for hitting you with an oar earlier. <i>And</i> if you stomp on my feet a few times, it’ll only be fair.”</p>
    <p>“Fine,” Lucinia folds her arms, “<i>And</i> if you try to trip me I’m going to punch you in the throat. Fair?” </p>
    <p>Cel nods. “Also fair,” she says, offering Luci a hand. Lucinina takes it slowly, without letting her guard down. Seeing no immediate ambush, Lucinia follows Cel to the dancing.</p>
    <p>Lucinia spends the first few moments awkwardly swaying and watching the crowd as if expecting an assassin. After a couple minutes however, she realizes that no one seems to mind her presence. She attempts to mimic the river elf dancing, then realizes there is not any set form to it. Finally, she seems to let go of something and simply starts to move however she likes. She moves with the music well, and might even be enjoying herself. There is even a moment where she almost smiles. Almost. </p>
    <p>That almost-smile is ruined when Cel steps on her foot. </p>
    <p>Cel blinks. “<small>Shit</small>,” she says quietly. “Well now that’s embara--”</p>
    <p>"<i>Treachery!</i>" Lucinia yells as she immediately leaps ar Cel. Lucinia grabs her by the shirt and attempts to shove her away. The attack falters as both hit a patch of mud near the river. They both slip and fall into a scrambling muddy pile.</p>
    <p>"This is all <i>your</i> fault!" Lucinia yells as she throws a few wild muddy swings.</p>
    <p>“<i>My</i> fault?” Cel says, trying to perform an acrobatic leap to her feet… and promptly slipping on the mud, causing her to crash face-first into Luci.</p>
    <p>"<i>Oof!</i>" Lucinia barks, "Prepare to face <i>Just Punishmphbl-</i>"</p>
    <p>Lucinia attempts to put Cel into a rough headlock, but loses purchase in the muck and only succeeds at driving them both facefirst into the mud.  </p>
    <p>"<b>MUD FIGHT!</b>" A bystander shouts, alerting Acris and the krewe to the goings on.</p>
    <p>Acris takes Nobody's hand and excitedly pulls her toward the mess.  This early in summer the nights are already hot and steamy close to the ocean.  He slides through the mud and then keeps sliding until he's planted in the river.</p>
    <p>The river elf pops back up out of the water like a cork. "I'm okay!"  And then he casts <span class="AcrisMagic">Drench</span> over the other two again.</p>
    <p>Cel sighs. “Why though,” she mutters to herself, scraping mud off of her uniform and then rolling it into a ball. She glances casually at Luci, mud-ball in hand. Lucinia blinks a little bit, then squints.</p>
    <p>"Very well," She rapidly begins scrambling to get her own mud ball together, "Let this be our field of battle!" </p>
    <p>“Exactly!” Cel says, before she spins and flings the ball at Acris’ face. </p>
    <p>Acris takes the hit and then ducks down for more ammunition.</p>
    <p>Acris ducking saves him from taking a winged elf to the face as Darsi whoops and goes over him, splashing down into the river. He sputters up out of the water and splashes back to the shore, gathering less mud balls and more just a handful. His scatter-shot attempt is tactically sound, but his wild throw knocks his own feet out from under him and he splats back into the mud.</p>
    <p>"Then a melee it is!" Lucinia declares, then pivots to aim at Darsi, "Then let us be-<i>mphpl!</i>"</p>
    <p>Lucinia is interrupted by a ball of mud hitting her directly in the mouth. Her shot goes wild as she loses her footing and spits out mud.</p>
    <p>A small giggle gives away Shady's position as she darts around the edges of the mud pit and starts preparing another ball. </p>
    <p>At the edge of the filthy scuffle, Nobody stands with a typical confused look.  While she shows no intention to join the melee, she does seem to be paying fairly intense attention to it.</p>
    <p>A mudball whizzes towards Shady, splattering against a bush a few feet away. Cel ducks, and begins rolling up another one. Shady giggles again and ducks to the side, raising another mudball.</p>
    <p>"Dodge <i>this!</i>" A mud coated Lucinia yells as she charges Shady with arms open. Shady attempts to juke out of the way, but Lucinia tracks her movements, wraps her arms around Shady's waist, and twists sideways, throwing both of them into deeper mud. Shady makes a valiant attempt to wiggle free, but is unable to prevent being smeared through the mud. She makes a sound that is half giggling half hissing. </p>
    <p>Darsi, seeing a rare opportunity, scrabbles through the mud and flops gracelessly on top of the pile, mud-caked wings limiting Shady’s escape attempts. “Good catch, Luci!” </p>
    <p>“Pile in!” Cel shouts, dropping onto the side of group mud-attack. Acris flops into the pile. He is followed by a huffing Boots. The small hippo leaves a wake of chaos in the mud brawl.</p>
    <p>As the scrum intensifies, Nobody’s expression of confusion softens… and after a moment, there is even a hint of a smirk. Gander provides an <span class="tooltip">indignant honk.<span class="tooltiptext">Translation: "Are they always like this?"</span></span></p>

    <h2 id="Watchtower">The Watchtower</h2>
    <p>The Year’s End celebration at the Watchtower is reminiscent of the earliest days of Asavardi, or even older, back to the tiny forest villages. The community is small and close-knit, even between the village itself and the observatory. Each part of the settlement had their own small celebrations, but a circle of pavilions has been set up roughly halfway between where everyone could gather. </p>
    <p>Large quantities of food are being prepared at a temporary open-air kitchen, and more of the pavilions have specialty items: different foods, crafts, trinkets. It’s a cheerful, colorful celebration, and Anasatri is gleefully enjoying the holiday. Her dour shadow, maybe less so. </p>
    <p>“It’s like the street markets in Surt, when a River convoy is in the area,” Tsun says, looking carefully through the stalls and pavilions. “With significantly fewer open flames, perhaps. And more… verticality.”</p>
    <p>“Oh I remember that,” Anasatri says, looking up from a stall with fresh flowers. “I didn’t have time to look around like I’d hoped, but we flew over a street market on the way to the potluck. Some of the scouts that were helping map the Maar brought back stories and ideas; we just have more room than Asavardi does now. How do you celebrate Year’s End? I remember seeing bonfires, and dancing.” </p>
    <p>Tsun aggressively rolls her eyes. “Yes, there are <i>fires</i>, and <i>dancing</i>, and the two in combination,” she says. “But honestly, there’s more to Surtian culture than its <i>drunkest and most licentious elements.</i> Elves get so hung up on ‘sexy naked dancing’ that they miss the <i>symbology</i>; the fires of rebirth, creation through destruction, the metaphorical purity of the flames. I pity my brothers and sisters in the Fire Dancers who are trying to send a message -- to provoke thought -- because all anyone can talk about is hot br--... hot bodies.” </p>
    <p>“It’s certainly a way to draw a crowd,” Anasatri muses. “Though not great for getting people to pay attention to philosophy, I suppose. What about you, then? Or other people not in that group?” </p>
    <p>“Ashwalkers,” Tsun says, “practice penance during the new year. We cast ourselves in ashes and fast throughout the day. On the night of, drink a carefully-prepared and blessed alcohol, wash ourselves in oils, and join together in a cleansing bonfire. It also symbolizes where we came from; Muspelham’s fall, and our rebirth and renewal from it. ...It’s also the traditional day on which to apologize for hurting each other, so we can start the new year fresh.” </p>
    <p>“More exciting than what we tend to do, certainly.” Anasatri gestures around them, “It’s a community day for us. We celebrate the connections we have with people, and have get-togethers like this to renew those ties. If someone has had a major impact on you in the previous year, you can make a token to give them.” She holds out her wrists, both encased in an array of jewelry, “That’s what most of these are. They don’t have to be bracelets, but they’re the most common.”</p>
    <p>She looks up at the sunset, “If people have joined a family in the past year, there’s a flying game they can do, again to show those connections. So if you see anyone up carrying a lantern, that’s what that is.” </p>
    <p>“Joined a family,” Tsun says. “Marriages, births, and adoptions?” She pauses. “The bracelets are interesting, and I understand some of the significance; it’s a fine way of providing a symbol of community and allegiance.” </p>
    <p>“Hmm,” Anasatri taps one of her bracelets, “Marriage is probably the closest thing? We don’t really have a formality for it, at least not like I’ve seen other elves do. I guess adoption is close too. One of my family members came along with his sister and was sort of the odd one out for awhile before he found a lover.” </p>
    <p>She shifts some of the bracelets, “Tokens are supposed to be hand-made, so the quality is sometimes...dubious. Or you cheat and get someone to help you.” She grins and shakes her wrist, setting off a cascade of clattering and jingles, “Not many people wear them, at least not so many at once, but I like it. Do fire elves trade gifts for any holidays?” </p>
    <p>“There are Calestrian holidays like that, but… well, gift-giving seems a little… divisive after having lost so much.” Tsun sighs. “This is reminding me too much of a city that may no longer be around anymore. I should… just go back to the Orrery. Meditate. Try to make sense of things.” </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, Tsun, I shouldn’t have asked.” Anasatri pauses, “It might be too different to be worth it, but if you wanted to try to do your own rites, you can.” </p>
    <p>“...Do they help?” Tsun asks.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know.” She tilts her head, “A bonfire would be tough to come by, but you might be able to do something symbolic with a brazier or candle. I doubt She would complain if it might make you feel a little better.” </p>
    <p>“I meant more the Winged rites,” Tsun says. “I’m not sure I deserve our-- the ones I formerly practiced. Not anymore. ...How does one make one of these bracelets?”</p>
    <p>Anasatri smiles, “Depends on what you like. Here, there should be a table with some supplies. You can use wire, or cord, or leather, whatever you like!” </p>
    <p>Tsun is still sitting at the crafting table, twisting at something, as the sun starts to set behind her. </p>
    <p>A small pastry appears on the table beside her. “Need a break?” Anasatri asks. </p>
    <p>“I need better fingers,” Tsun grumbles. She holds up a copper wire bracelet, running in a crosshatch-ladder pattern up to a series of carefully-wrapped flat white stones. Some of the crosshatching is crooked, and at the far ends, the copper wire bends around Tsun’s hands like wet noodles.</p>
    <p>“The more frustrated I get, the more difficult this becomes,” Tsun says.</p>
    <p>Anasatri tilts her head, peering at the wire, “Is it...oh it is sort of melting, isn’t it. Yeah I can see that being difficult. That’s looking <i>really</i> nice though. Braiding wire is hard.” She chuckles, a little guilty, “I had to cheat and get someone else to help me on that a few years ago.” </p>
    <p>“It was something of a hobby of my father’s,” Tsun admitted. “Not that I remember much of it. I thought I could… at least try it, and get the same results. It’s not hard in concept.” </p>
    <p>“No, but it’s a skill that needs practice.” She takes a seat across the table from Tsun, “I usually just use braided cord or leather; wire hurts my fingers. But if that’s your first ever try at wire work? That’s <i>impressive</i>. You have a really good eye for it.” </p>
    <p>Tsun bites her lip, and nods to herself. “Here,” she says, handing the bracelet to Anasatri.</p>
    <p>“...Me?” Anasatri looks from the bracelet back to Tsun. “I...you…” She fluffs her feathers and shakes her head, smiling a little as she takes it, running the band through her fingers. “Thank you, I’m happy that you wanted to make one.” She rummages through the tangled mess of bracelets on her wrist, coming up with one made of tiny stone beads. “I haven’t made one for a fire elf before; the cord is leather, so I hope it holds up.” </p>
    <p>“Leather should be fine,” Tsun says, accepting the bracelet. “I’m not the Fury; I don’t set fire to everything I touch whenever I have a temper tantrum. ...Thank you.” </p>
    <p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
