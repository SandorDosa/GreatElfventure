        A New Year
    </title>
</head>
<h1>A New Year</h1>
<p>It seems the year has been kind to Fort Álfyr and the blade elves. The fort appears to be in much better shape, with its outer walls and most of its structures having been either rebuilt or reinforced. There are even new buildings being made, with those new barracks being greatly expanded and still undergoing construction. The blade elves are even starting to decorate, replacing the Lycan frescoes and blood red coloration with their own art and the blue coloration they now favor. Most of their frescoes are of elves with swords, but hey, it’s progress.</p>
<p>The slowly expanding farmland around the Fort also seems to be working. The most obvious evidence of this is the fact that the blade elves have a solid abundance of food available, and even appear to have discovered some seasonings like rosemary and thyme. The food is all still relatively basic, mostly meat, fish and potatoes, but there are some chargrilled oysters as well with a few toppings available.</p>
<p>The great hall has seen the most redecoration, with a wide fresco depicting all of your various elf types in miscellaneous cool heroic poses wrapping around the room. The table is uncovered this time, showing the polished and well maintained depiction of Calestro’s mirror.</p>
<p>Ehra, with his permanent patient smile, sits at the table with Siiri beside him. There are a few papers stacked beside him. If there’s a crack in Ehra’s smile, you can’t tell. Like last year, Katiin waits for guests at the door. </p>
<p>“I still think I should be standing to greet our guests.” Ehra comments to Siiri</p>
<p>“Not this time. Physician’s orders. That’s what happens when you throw your back out doing an exhibition for the new recruits.” Siiri explains sternly.</p>
<p>“They deserve to know what a master in action looks like.” Ehra sniffs defensively, though with a smirk.</p>
<p>Siiri sighs, “Sir… if you were a sword, you’d be in a museum.”</p>
<p>Ehra laughs the comment off, Katiin rolls her eyes.</p>
<p>As with the previous year, the winged elves are the first to arrive. Shadimon and Anasatri have come, along with a new face - Dhakamari, the head of the rangers. Dhakamari is shy, still uncertain about becoming an important community figure, and mostly lurks behind Shadimon. He’s carrying a large cloth bundle and trying (and failing) to be subtle about looking around at the frescos. </p>
<p>Katiin greets them warmly as they enter. She gives Dhakamari a quiet smile as he oggles the frescoes. There are at least two winged elves high on the wall, depicted in dramatic flight.</p>
<p>Anasatri is carrying a platter borrowed from the Fort kitchens loaded with strips of seasoned meat and vegetables on a bed of flatbread. She sets it on the edge of the table and goes around to offer Ehra and Siiri a hug. “It’s so good to see you again! How have you been? The Fort looks wonderful!” </p>
<p>Ehra stands with Siiri's help and enthusiastically returns the hug. Siiri's a little surprised to get dragged into it, but doesn't complain.</p>
<p>"Thank you, dear," Ehra grins, "We've been hard at work on the old girl, I'm glad it shows. We've had a good year. I am so glad to see your group, after hearing how much trouble happened on the river. I'll be much at ease when everyone arrives."</p>
<p>“So will we,” Shadimon says, coming to stand with them. “We haven’t had much news out where we are. But if you have, then Partager must have made it back through here safely, and that’s a relief.” He offers his hand to Ehra, “Good to see you.”</p>
<p>Ehra grasps Shadimon’s hand with both of his own, “Yes, good to see you too. Partager passed through just a few months ago. They seemed a little worse for the wear, but they’re river elves. If they’re moving, they’ll make it. I believe they were off to look for the fire elves. I haven’t heard anything else, though. Except for, well… Ah, that can wait. Only good news from me today.”</p>
<p>“Agreed, absolutely. Here, this is Dhakamari. He’s our lead ranger and came in Varna’s place. Things have been busy with us, so it seemed best to leave Baijani and Varna to handle things for awhile.”</p>
<p>Dhakamari shyly nods his head to Ehra, having obviously heard of but never personally met the commander of the blade elves. “Sir, pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>"You're Dhakamari?" Ehra asks with a smile, "The river elves told me about you! Your flight was an incredible feat. I would love to hear your tale of it sometime."</p>
<p>Dhakamari squirms, “Ah, yessir. It was just what had to be done.”</p>
<p>Anasatri puts an arm and a wing over his shoulders, “He’s still not prepared for people to make much of him. It’s entirely adorable, if you ask me. Come on, sparrow, let’s go have a seat.”</p>
<p>Siiri touches Shadimon on the arm as he passes, "Ehra's being a bit dramatic. A river elf barge got here this morning, and there was a fire elf boat behind them. Dark elves got here last night, and the dreamdust elves have been dream messaging us. I don't know about anyone else, though."</p>
<p>The river elf barge that had arrived was, in fact, the Hylidae Family raft.  This is quickly evidenced by Litoria and a very young elf that the others may not recognize arriving with the hippopotamus in tow.  Litoria carries a large earthenware crock, very similar to the one they brought last year, and the young elf has a bundle wrapped in linen, which he complains at length about as they enter.</p>
<p>“Nah, I ain’t gon’ let you shirk, Acris,” Litoria scolds on their way in, “Sauver ain’t yer packmule, an Smilisca gave you a task ta do.”</p>
<p>Litoria puts the crock down with a heavy thud on the floor near the table to not scratch its surface, giving away its hefty weight.  Sauver nudges her side, now standing as high as her shoulder.  <?php echo firstcontact("Acris Hylidae");?> grumbles more as he puts his bundle on the table as well.</p>
<p>Freed from her burden, Litoria approaches to shake Ehra’s hand and greet the elder.</p>
<p>“Goodness!” Ehra looks past Litoria, “Sauver’s gotten so big! It’s so good to see you and your family, Litoria. Not to be a poor host, of course, but was Staurois unable to come? I wouldn’t think you could keep that man away from a feast if you tried.”</p>
<p>Litoria shakes her head.</p>
<p>“Ny’s not feeling up to travelin’ at speed, so it’s just us.  Weh, we ken make better time ‘en ‘em.  Seems I lost Smilisca somewhere in the fort though.  ‘Yall seen him this mornin?”  Litoria looks to Ehra’s companions.</p>
<p>Acris, meanwhile, is pilfering potatoes.  </p>
<p>Katiin sighs, “About the same time I lost track of Terje. Odd, that.” </p>
<p>The Dreamdust elves are next to arrive.  Pebble waves enthusiastically at everyone in the room, clinging to a box of pastries with the other.  Dust and Dave follow, flanking a small spiky lizardfolk.  “We made friends!  This is <?php echo firstcontact("Tik'Tak");?>!”  Tik’Tak tries to hide behind Dust.</p>
<p>Anasatri hops up to go give Pebble a hug, “I’ve missed you! How have you been? And you made friends!” She looks at the spiky head peeking around Dust, “Tik’Tak, was it? Hello!” </p>
<p>“We’ve been good!  Some misunderstandings with the Machakw, Tik’Tak’s folk, but that’s all resolved.  We’ve also got some news about other elves in the area, but we don’t know much more than that.”</p>
<p>"You are all so tall," Tik'Tak looks back and forth at the group, "What do they feed you all, and where do I get some?" He gives the winged elf a curious look, "You most! Wings look fun."</p>
<p>Anasatri grinned while Shadimon and Dhakamari exchanged bemused looks at being called tall. “We eat just about anything. The wings take a lot of energy to work. Come sit, there will be plenty of food soon.”</p>
<p>"Yes, but make sure you tell everyone I'm an elf," Tik'Tak holds his fingers out next to his ear holes with a completely deadpan look on his face, "Very important. Don't want to be left out."</p>
<p>“Spiky elf!”  Pebble nods emphatically.</p>
<p>Tik'Tak throws a pillow onto a chair and hauls himself up to the table. "Yes," he returns the nod solemnly, "Spiky elf." </p>
<p>At some point, two dark elves peal themselves from the shadows of a hallway and hover in a relatively secluded corner.  Shyrendora is recognizable, but the other is new and younger - also being gently nudged towards the large group.</p>
<p>The young elf practically launches forward to join, sidling up next to the winged-elves mainly out of familiarity.  “Hi guys!  Whoa that is a spiky elf there.  How are things?  Good?”</p>
<p>Shyrendora sighs loudly from her corner...fondly...sort of. </p>
<p>“<?php echo firstcontact("Amenidal");?>! Glad to see you made it back safely.” Anasatri leans around and hugs him too. “Good since you last saw is, happily.”</p>
<p>Shadimon nods toward Shyrendora, “We were worried you might not make it. Good to see you.” </p>
<p>Amenidal returns the hug with gusto before puffing his chest out in pride.  “<?php echo firstcontact("Trischal");?> made me Shyrendora’s escort!  I’m not great at sneaking but she said I make a good walking target…” his brow furrows for a second, “no wait she said I make a good distraction.  Yeah that.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora makes as if to try and quell the boy’s words, but stops with yet another sigh.  She looks to Shadimon with a tired nod of her own.  “We almost didn’t.  But I stressed the importance of this to my fellow leaders and they relented.”</p>
<p>Amenidal leans closer to Anasatri and whispers, “Trischal being a worried wife forever and always.”</p>
<p>“Not married.”</p>
<p>“But you should be!”</p>
<p>Slowly, Shyrendora sinks into a sitting position and doesn’t look like she is going to move for a good long while.  </p>
<p>“Rough time?” Dust sits down by Shyrendora.  </p>
<p>“Something like that.”  Shyrendora acquires her favored flask and takes a sip.  “The year has been kind and cruel in turns, but we are surviving.”  She gives a bemused smile as she watches Tik’Tak, “I see you have gained a new friend.”</p>
<p>Tik’Tak doesn’t notice that he’s being talked about, as he is very distracted by the large pile of food in front of him.</p>
<p>“We have.  It took time, but eventually we made friends.  We’ve sighted other elves spying on us though, so we’re keeping up our guard.”</p>
<p>She offers her flask, “Perhaps we shall share once we have all convened.  I don’t have the energy to tell more than once with so many people around.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough.”  Dust takes a sip, and his eyebrows went up.  He offered his own flask.  “You’re welcome to try ours, but it’s fermented from goat milk, I recommend you smell it first.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora goes against wisdom and takes a sip without doing the recommended sniff test.  She blinks with raised brows and looks at the flask before handing it back.  “Mm.  Interesting and not bad.  I will have to tell Greg to try that one day.” </p>
<p>“We’d be happy to send a few bottles your way.  We do want to talk about trade at some point.”</p>
<p>“I am no good at trade talk, but I have heard Uncle enough times to give it a shot.”</p>
<p>“There’s no rush, but we wanted to see what we could trade in exchange for hiring a few of your folks for some flyover scouting.” </p>
<p>The door kicked open, and in shuffled a pair of Fire Elves, carrying armloads of jugs and amphora. The first was quite obviously the Hunger; the second was dressed in sharp green, and had a jaunty mustache on his face, with an even jauntier grin below it. <?php echo firstcontact("Barrabus Leafstorm");?>, the "Phoenix Lord."</p>
<p>The two haphazardly placed the wine jugs onto a nearby table, and then nodded to each other and split -- the Hunger headed towards Ehra, while Barrabus set about pouring a few cups of wine from the variety of containers scattered about the room.</p>
<p>"The decor is much improved, at least," the Hunger said, stepping up to Calestros' table.</p>
<p>Litoria accepts a cup of wine from the fire elves appreciatively, and then finishes setting out a pile of freshly fermented raw crab.  Next to it, she unrolls Acris’s bundle of exotic jungle spices to share.</p>
<p>Ehra smiles warmly, "Peacetime does wonders for one's interior decorations. Thank you for coming, Hunger. How has Surt been faring?"</p>
<p>"Very well," the Hunger replied. He seems a little more… stiff than a year ago, and there is noticeable greying at his temples. "We have achieved relative agricultural self-sufficiency, built a stable basic infrastructure, and even started work on serious internal defenses. All in all, aside from a few incidents, this has been an excellent year."</p>
<p>"I hope those incidents were nothing too trying. I've heard it's been a hard year for many of our fellows." Ehra speaks solemnly. </p>
<p>"My understanding is you've had a few strange incidents yourselves," the Hunger said. He settled onto a chair, keeping his face fixed on Ehra.</p>
<p>Ehra frowns, "a few unusual things have happened yes, but nothing exactly tragic." </p>
<p>"But strange, or unexpected? Strange sightings in the fort at night? Signs of Lycan scouts patrolling around inside your walls?"</p>
<p>Shadimon frowns from across the table, “Lycan scouts? Have Lycans actually been seen?”</p>
<p>Litoria looks to The Hunger expectantly.</p>
<p>"I have <i>absolutely not</i> seen any sign of Lycans," Ehra's expression immediately grow serious, "Hunger, if you're trying to get a rise out of me you're succeeding. That is not something to speak of lightly."</p>
<p>Barrabus reached down for his fourth cup -- this one of Chadonnay Au Bear, a rare vintage even before the Empire's fall.</p>
<p>Nothing. He glanced down at its empty spot on the table, and then about the room. After a second, he spotted his missing mug -- in the hands of the elf that had been rolling out fermented crab earlier.</p>
<p>"Damn," he muttered to himself. He <i>liked</i> chadonnay. He reached for the amphora, and grabbed the mug he'd been using for Beerhunter mead before he had decided (as usual) that it tasted like fermented bee poo.</p>
<p>The amphora of Au Bear was empty. "Double damn."</p>
<p>"Our first incident this year featured a Lycan adventurer who decided to go bar-hopping in our borders unannounced," the Hunger said. "The next featured a pile of dead humans ten miles outside the city. Their heads had been marked with hefja blót and eyðask runes, while the rest had been torn to pieces. If they were not killed by Lycans, we were at least meant to suspect as much. To make matters worse, our guard patrols have reported strange howlings and odd activity on several occasions -- and I doubt our patrols are the only ones." That last line was pointedly at Ehra. "I'm willing to state that our guards are likely a little overexcited, but both a Lycan tourist and dead men left at our doorstep have given them good reason. And honestly, Ehra, sometimes it seems like I have "get a rise out of you" in order to be taken seriously. Work with me here, godsdamnit."</p>
<p>Litoria looks to The Hunger suspiciously again.</p>
<p>“We have seen signs of large wolves outside Surt.  I do not know if wolves always mean Lycans,” she pauses, “mais there was a, ah - tourist.</p>
<p>The Hunger paused. "Where? Directly to the south of Surt, or closer to the river? How long ago?"</p>
<p>“As I tol’ yall before we done left the town,” Litoria looks a bit confused, “was a camp for six ta ten humanoi’s an’ dir’ wolf prints, ‘bout five miles outa Surt on da riverbank.  Look’d ‘bout six months old.”</p>
<p>He nodded. "My apologies, you had mentioned that. ...Our research suggested the humans in the encampment we found had been dead for about six months, as well."</p>
<p>Barrabus glanced down at another jug. "Elderberry. Eugh."</p>
<p>Acris makes an attempt to get a cup of his own, but his hands are immediately swatted by the very watchful Warmaster.  He pouts.</p>
<p>Ehra takes a deep breath, "I apologize for the accusation, Hunger. Just to confirm what you said, you met an actual Lycan? Not signs or evidence, but actually encountered one?" </p>
<p>“Mais,” Litoria answers, eyes lowered, “we surpris’d an elf on da river.  Come to fin’ she wadn’t no elf later.  Ain’t callin’ one person a whole ah - organization, not yet, weh.”</p>
<p>"And their humanoid for was an elf," Ehra scratches his chin, "Did either of you learn this Lycan's animal form? For that matter, was it the same Lycan?"</p>
<p>"Wolf animal form," the Hunger said. "White hair in both. Humanoid form looks distinctly like a Blade Elf, and was carrying a large executioner's sword when last seen. And very definitely a Lycan, seeing as she demonstrated both an exceptionally powerful howl, and both hybrid and animal forms before she left.</p>
<p>"Her overall behavior does not fit with the dead human auxiliaries, however. I think it is unlikely that she herself is a scout -- or if so, she is a bad one. But she is a Lycan, and a volatile one, and her presence combined with these other results is a negative sign indeed."</p>
<p>Barrabus sidled over to Acris. "You seem the type to know your way around a wine," he said quietly, angling himself away from the Warmaster. "Do our hosts have any spiced wines? The good kind, with fennel and cinnamon?"</p>
<p>Acris lights up like a godsdamned beacon.  Someone is treating him like an adult.  At last.  Acris the Awesome has found his new Favorite.</p>
<p>“Weh!  I dunno bout wine, but I shore do know about cinnamon!” He points out coiled sticks in the spices he’d carried in.  “And vanilla! You know is an orchid?  Grows all pretty like on vines.” </p>
<p>Ehra grits his teeth. "Wolf. I've never met a werewolf that would travel alone by choice. Their animal's instinct gives them a strong notion to work as a group. Hunger's right, we may be forced to assume she's not alone. Considering what we, personally, have done to her people we may also need to assume she may be hostile. And a blade elf…" he trails off, looking pensive. </p>
<p>Shadimon glances at Dhakamari and back at Ehra and Hunger. “We’d like a day or two before we head back south. We can scout the area around the Fort much further and much faster than your ground patrols. We’ll see if we can find them.”</p>
<p>"We would appreciate that," the Hunger said.</p>
<p>“Our area has been entirely quiet,” Shadimon added. “But we’re much further south, and they may be sticking near the mountains. But Litoria, you said you had a ‘tourist’ as well. This same white-haired blade elf?”</p>
<p>“Weh.”  Litoria nods, and reaches to pat Sauver.  “A white-haired blade elf with a silver sword, who ain’t done a lick a’ harm while aboard.”</p>
<p>“A <i>silver</i> sword?”</p>
<p>“Could they be hunting Afflicted after the war?” Anasatri asks, frowning.</p>
<p>"I've never in my life heard of a Lycan using silver weapons," Ehra states, "They do hate afflicted as much as we do, if not more. Perhaps? I haven't heard of any afflicted in the area." Ehra replies.</p>
<p>“No mistake,” Litoria looks to Anasatri, “sword was silver, an’ bigger ‘en Shyrendora.”</p>
<p>A series of small thuds, barely audible through the doors, grow closer.  The door is pushed open- not really slammed or thrust, but definitely with more force than is typically polite.</p>
<p>Standing in the doorframe is a large, greyskinned figure; Six and a half feet tall, wearing a simple leather jerkin.  Her face is framed by medium length, purplish hair, and an expression of effort stands out slightly. </p>
<p>The source of said effort is soon obvious.  She strides into the room, carrying a massive spit with an entire elk, cleaned, gutted, and roasted.  Supporting the other end of the spit is another grey figure, even taller, who seems to be having an easier time holding up her end.  Unlike the strained but otherwise placid expression of her companion, she seems… mirthful? Her small eyes flit about the room, a wry expression on her face, curly dark green hair bouncing with each step.</p>
<p>The front one pauses awkwardly as everyone turns to stare.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the two of them don’t just slam the roasted carcass on the table.  It looks like one of them thought this through; the frontmost one takes a pair of wooden poles, topped with antlers, and sets them up… just, kinda, in the middle of the open area, before setting the elk on them.  The whole operation is conducted in silence.</p>
<p>After setting up their offering, the greenhaired one nods to the purple haired one, and then heads off to an unoccupied wall to lean heavily against, smirking all the way.</p>
<p>That leaves the purple haired one standing alone, unwitting center of attention.</p>
<p>She gazes around the room, expression placid.  She opens her mouth, voice deep, resonant, and, curiously, in common, not elf.</p>
<p>“This offering is to you, as was required.  We are here now.  We will be received in the correct manner.  We do not know what that is.”</p>
<p>Katiin pushes the door away from where it was practically thrown in her face, with a pained expression.</p>
<p>“Thank you for bringing such a generous offering,” Katiin states, “You are welcome to sit at our table and partake of our shared bounty.”</p>
<p>“Please, come,” Ehra motions to them, “My friends, I introduce <?php echo firstcontact("Slabal");?> of the crag elves. We may not have met, but we have shared the same battlefields. We appear to have set ourselves near their homes. Slabal came to us a few days ago, so that we may be formally introduced. Please, Slabal, join us.”</p>
<p>Slabal, as she has been correctly identified, glances at the aforementioned seats. There is a distinct pause.</p>
<p>She then proceeds forwards, and sits, the chair creaking slightly as she settles.</p>
<p>Slabal looks at the other assembled elves, before speaking again.  Her tone is without inflection.</p>
<p>“I will introduce myself now.  I am Slabal, as was correctly stated. I have other titles, and names.  They would hold no meaning for you.  I am here from the Crag.  I have been given a task to do so.  I have something I must do.  I think it will be wise to observe you beforehand.  I want to study how you... “</p>
<p>She pauses.  Her eyes unfocus a moment.</p>
<p>“...how you otherelves conduct your business.”</p>
<p>“<span class="tooltip">Dit mon la verite'!<span class="tooltiptext">“Tell me the truth.” Response when told something unbelievable.</span></span>” Litoria exclaims, “It’s them <span class="tooltip">couillons<span class="tooltiptext">Idiot, stupid, or testicle.</span></span> that lef’ us when the walls fell.  Mais, I for shore thought them all fer restin’ eternal.”  She waves to Acris enthusiastically.  “Fix ‘em a plate al’ready!”</p>
<p>The apprentice does as ordered, begrudgingly.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a href="../Crag/0_Aspects and Goals.php">More about Crag Elves</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>As the meal begins awkwardly, a couple of things happen. First, as Katiin goes to close the door, Smilisca and Terje awkwardly slide into the room. They seem to be in good spirits. As the two try to head towards the least noticeable seats off to the side, there is something of a clatter of confusion.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” A raspy voice answers.</p>
<p>Apparently, Terje tried to sit on a Cryptid. Somehow. Apparently, they arrived at the table at some point while everyone else was distracted by Slabal. And indeed it is a they, as for the first time there’s more than one of them. Ink, the tattooed one from the first potluck, is there. There is also another cryptid, apparently female, with ash grey skin and wearing black wraps that hood her face. The two have set down a tray of what appears to be fine cuts of raw fish wrapped in what appears to be some kind of waxy tree bark.</p>
<p>“Hello,” Ink says as the other cryptid places the tray down and sits. “You unwrap it first,” He adds helpfully. He provides no other comment.</p>
<p>Terje and Smilisca welcome the distraction and quietly sit next to each other. </p>
<p>Anasatri waves cheerfully down the table, “Hello Ink! Good to see you again too.” She makes sure to get a few pieces of the mysterious fish, passing one to Dhakamari and Shadimon as well. After some contemplation, she manages to get a portion of meat off of the roasted elk, taking it off to share with the other winged elves as well.</p>
<p>The fish actually has a quite delicate texture and flavor. It appears to have been soaked in some kind of very light vinegar, and the bark that was wrapped around it lends it a savory flavor. It is raw, but the preparation gives the very carefully selected cuts of fish an almost buttery texture. </p>
<p>“Delicious!” Anasatri declares of the fish. “Also delicious!” she adds after trying to roast elk. She smiles broadly at both crag elves, “Pleased to meet you, Slabal. I’m Anasatri. This is Shadimon, and Dhakamari.” She looks to the one leaning against the wall, “Can we know your name too?” </p>
<p>For her part, Slabal looks like she’s doing her best to follow along.  She carefully watches how other people eat various pieces, to avoid making any comical mistakes.  However, the first time she actually popped something into her mouth, she visibly winced.</p>
<p>That didn’t stop her from finishing it, or continuing to clear the plate whenever something is put on it.  She keys in on the fact that you should also fill your own plate after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Slabal nods at Anasatri, looking more like she’s mimicking the action than doing it naturally.</p>
<p>“It is not yet pleasing to meet you, but there is potential.  I see little that should interfere, apart from this challenge.”</p>
<p>The wallelf, who has assumed a traditional-coolkid-leaning-on-a-wall posture, does not partake. When addressed she just points a finger and looks straight at Anasatri.</p>
<p>“<?php echo firstcontact("Embebi");?>.  Thus is this name. It will be (easy for?) you to remember.”</p>
<p>Her use of language is… odd.  Unlike Slabal, she speaks in elf… but an absurdly old dialect.  It’s near incomprehensible.</p>
<p>“Embebi, thank you. I hope it becomes pleasing to know you.”</p>
<p>Embebi issues a short bark of laughter.</p>
<p>Slabal glances sidelong at Embebi, who clams up, but keeps her smirk.  She then returns her gaze to the table.</p>
<p>“Should Embebi state something which causes offense, or breaches ritual, know that she does not represent my interests.  She was- is here to aid me.  If she ceases to aid, and instead hinders, I can direct her to be elsewhere.  As Aggro, she has little need of fundamentally correct interaction.” Slabal concludes, like that explains anything.</p>
<p>“Give the ‘prentise the boot if he done mucks up an’thin’ too,” Smilisca says with a grin in their direction, but is looking straight at Acris.  Acris for his part, is slowly putting down the amphora and removing his webbed hands from it.</p>
<p>“Aw,” Terje nudges Smilisca, “Give the kid a break, it’s a party. He’s gotta live sometime, right?”</p>
<p>“Mebee when ‘e’s not still in ‘d mud.  Mebee.”  Smilisca nods.</p>
<p>“How have things been on the flotilla since the flood?” Dhakamari asks. He has been shooting glances at the river elves this entire time, but either waiting for a good time or working up his nerve to say something.</p>
<p>Barrabus was quite good at getting subtext, and even better at wantonly disregarding it. He grabbed one of the jugs from the Fire Elf table -- one of only three that did not have a light sprinkling of dust over the top -- poured a little into a mug, and surreptitiously slipped the mug into Acris' hand. "Try this," he whispered, keeping his eyes on the newcomers.</p>
<p>“We’re movin’,” Smilisca responds to Dhakamari, “and makin’ plenty of progress toward really findin’ our place here.”</p>
<p>Acris does his very best to not be too obvious about accepting the mug, and then pretending to pour water into it and then takes a quick gulp of whatever it was he’d been poured.</p>
<p>The liquid is milk-white and smooth, with a texture just thicker than milk, and a taste neatly between sweet, spicy, and sour. A sensitive drinker might notice a slight alcoholic aftertaste, all but masked by the spicy-sweet aroma.</p>
<p>"It's called pulque; ol' Hungry found the recipe for it some time ago. It's not my favorite, but it's a good for long meetings. And this will be a long meeting." He paused for a second. "You mentioned vanilla? I have a few friends at home who would love some cultivars."</p>
<p>The Hunger leaned a little closer to Ehra. He, too, kept his eyes on the newcomers. "You seemed surprised. No incursions or weird accidents at all?"</p>
<p>"No unusual accidents," Siiri actually responds, "I investigate every work related injury. Nothing unusual."</p>
<p>"Night patrol spotted a cloaked elf snooping near the barracks a few weeks ago," Ehra notes, "But they evaded capture. Definitely no howling or anything like you mentioned."</p>
<p>"Keep your eyes open," he replied. "For your own sake, as well as ours. Your people have the strongest military of all of us, and everyone knows it; if the Lycans seek revenge, their first strike will likely be against you." </p>
<p>Ehra nods, “On this, we agree. Do you know Dreyrugr swore he would eat my heart? It makes an impression on a fellow. I have been keeping security as tight as I can, but I am… concerned that we know war better than subterfuge.”</p>
<p>"We have a similar problem," the Hunger said. He leaned back somewhat, setting his gaze back on the newcomer in the corner. "Minus Dreyrugr's personal antipathy, of course." He chuckled. "The Terror has been considering mandatory drills -- "red-team blue-team" examinations or something like that. Strategies to make our 'op-sec' a little bit stronger." </p>
<p>It seems that something about that conversation caused Embebi’s ears to prick.  Without saying a word, she leaves her wallside post, padding quietly closer to the Hunger.  It’s somewhat surprising how silent someone over 6 and a half feet can be.</p>
<p>She doesn’t loom, instead sort of settling into a casual crouch in the space behind him.  Quiet.  Attentive.</p>
<p>Ehra gives Embebi an acknowledging nod before continuing, "Perhaps not a bad idea. Of course, we'd have to work out the details of such a system carefully as well as who knows about what. Many potential ways that could be exploited."</p>
<p>"Perhaps w-" Ehra is cut short.</p>
<p>"We can." The black-clad cryptid is standing behind him.</p>
<p>Ehra forces a neutral expression onto his face.</p>
<p>"Ah." He replies. </p>
<p>The sudden appearance of the cryptid seems to cause a change in Embebi’s demeanor.  No longer smirking, she rises slowly from her crouch, drawing up to her full height.  Although trying to mind the conversation, she seems to be dividing her attention now. </p>
<p>On the other side of the table, Slabal slows her consumption as more conversation springs up; for a while there, it looked like she was just trying to eat in order to keep pace.  During her consumption, her attention was also split; she seems to be spending a great deal of focus inspecting the table in detail. Analyzing it.  Running her fingers over its polished surface.</p>
<p>“Anasatri,” she intones, one of the few names she knows, “do your people lack for iron?”</p>
<p>“I’m...not sure? My people specifically don’t have a lot, but we’re doing fine. Why? Do you have access?” </p>
<p>Slabal stares for a moment, then her placid expression twitches.  “Ah.  No.  Not your people, not specifically.  A very imprecise word.  The people who own this table, which I assume, in some way, is all of you, but perhaps it singularly belongs to another.  I notice the table is… damaged.  Its primary construction is in steel.  Well maintained.  But it seems it was sundered, and repaired with brass.  Odds are that choice was due to the difficulty in obtaining more iron for steel, or perhaps some… aesthetic choice.”</p>
<p>Her gaze had shifted to the table, as she ran her fingers along one of the brass “cracks” in the mirror.  After not saying anything for a couple seconds, she stops, then stares back at Anasatri.</p>
<p>“If it is due to a lack, that is something that could be remedied by the Crag.  It would be beneficial for my mission if we could provide something that you… not you, Anasatri, but Lowla- which otherelves would need.  Which I suppose could include you.” </p>
<p>“Ohhh! The table was intentional, yes. It’s supposed to be Calestros’ mirror, with the brass showing ‘repairs’, sort of. I don’t know if anyone else has found iron in their traveling, but I imagine it would be very happily received if you have it to trade.” She points at the river elves, “The river elves are becoming our major traders, and I’m sure we could work out good trade deals from everyone else. We found copper, for instance, if that’s useful to you.” </p>
<p>Slabal just sort of stares in response, that same detached, half-eyed stare that she’s wearing for practically the whole time she’s been here.  You get the feeling it’s a well worn in expression.</p>
<p>“I see.  Curious.  I am surprised that so much material would be expended in such an… I am guessing it is a devotional… endeavor.  I’m afraid copper is not of much use to us, except as an occasional decoration.  It is an excessively malleable metal.” </p>
<p>Her eyes settle on the indicated river elves.  Ah.  They were the ones with the crab.</p>
<p>“...Anasatri, do you know the correct way to address these River Elves?  I do not know their honorifics, nor their names.  It would not be wise of me to presume how I may communicate.”</p>
<p>“They seem to be pretty casual about titles. Smilisca is the one with the hat, Litoria is the one with the hippo - that’s Sauver, by the way - and Acris is the little one trying to be stealthy. Smilisca is the Navigator, and Litoria is the Warmaster. Name or title is acceptable, as far as I know.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Mechanical, unnatural nod.  Her vision unfocuses a moment, and she seems to talk to no one in particular. “Even curiouser.  You worship the gods, you name your animals, and you enjoy pungent flavors.  Perhaps the Esteemed is more readily capable of communicating with them than she believed.”</p>
<p>Focus back in.  “This is useful information, Anasatri.  If you wish recompense for aiding me in this way, I will do what I can, but can make no promises.  I will follow your wisdom shortly; it appears that I have more of this trial to overcome in order to match your- the Otherelves’- commitment.”</p>
<p>She scoops more of the meal onto her plate, and then begins consuming again in silence.</p>
<p>The Hunger made a quick note to ask Anasatri about a potential future copper trade. “Well, we’ll take any assistance you’re willing to offer,” he said, turning towards the Cryptid Elf. “Enemy at the gates once again, etcetera, etcetera.”</p>
<p>"Always." The cryptid comments to the Hunger, "We can watch the Fort. No more."</p>
<p>"That would be appreciated." Ehra seems to relax a bit, and the cryptid merely nods in reply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ink has apparently moved next to Pebble.</p>
<p>“Hello,” He rasps, “Is Namib well since he was returned?”</p>
<p>Tik’Tak, meanwhile, has pushed himself as far back in his chair as possible and is completely stock still with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“<small>Pebble… Pebble what.</small>”</p>
<p>“He’s good now, thanks!  It’s great to see you again, how have you been?  Oh, Ink, this is Tik’Tak.  Tik’Tak, this is Ink.  A cryptid elf.” </p>
<p>Tik’Tak waves, with a jerky motion and only his arm past the elbow moving.</p>
<p>“Pebble… Pebble it’s looking at me.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Tik’Tak.” Ink leans over slightly, “It is good that you did not hurt Namib or Pebble.”</p>
<p>“<small>Yep.</small>”</p>
<p>Ink turns back to Pebble, “You are very good at this.”</p>
<p>“Thanks?  So has anything interesting happened?  How did you know Namib was goatnapped?  I don’t think I had mentioned that yet.”</p>
<p>“Never met the guy, I swear.” Tik’Tak appears to be breathing again.</p>
<p>Ink looks back and forth between Pebble and Tik’Tak. He closes his eyes for a brief moment.</p>
<p>“Nothing interesting, not to us. We have a home now.” He pauses again, as if searching for words, “I was watching Namib. I said I would find him. I did. I almost took him back, but I did not need to.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” gulps Tik’Tak, “That’s nice.”</p>
<p>“You are very good at making friends.” Ink takes a breath, as if speaking that much took effort. </p>
<p>“Oh, thank you!  I like making friends.”  She grins broadly.  “I’m sorry Namib wasn’t with me when you wanted to pet him.”  There is a small bleat.  “But you can now?  And that shouldn’t happen again.”</p>
<p>“I would like to,” Ink turns his head, “He is very small.”</p>
<p>Pebble holds out Namib.</p>
<p>Ink pets the small goat gently with long fingers. Though his motions are still as eerily smooth as before, Namib seems much more at ease now. Tik’Tak, however, is looking at him like he’s about to eat the poor thing.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Namib and Pebble,” Ink returns his hand to his side, “And Tik’Tak.”</p>
<p>“Uh, no problem?” Tik’Tak wiggles in his chair nervously, “You keep the strangest company, Pebble. Spiky elves included.”</p>
<p>Ink makes a sound that is either a chuckle or a death rattle. It’s not clear.</p>
<p>Pebble eyes Ink with concern.  When the cryptid elf doesn’t fall over, she assumes it was a laugh.  “I like people,” she protests.  “People are interesting.” </p>
<p>Anasatri comes over to join them, keeping her wings tucked close to avoid getting in anyone's way. “People are interesting. Hello Ink. And hello again Tik’Tak. Did Pebble adopt you too?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” Tik’Tak says, “But I think  it was more of a… what do you say? Package deal?”</p>
<p>Ink nods slightly at Anasatri, but doesn’t say anything. </p>
<p>“Hi Anasatri!  Did I hear you say something about copper earlier?  I think Dust will want to talk about that later.” </p>
<p>“Glad to! We’re still working on how to get to it, but definitely.”</p>
<p>Dhakamari wandered down the table to the dark elves, taking an empty seat next to Amenidal. “Have things calmed down with you all? You had some, uh, exciting stories when you came to visit us.” </p>
<p>Amenidal perks up and gives Dhakamari a closed smile that still seems to vibrate happy energy.  “Oh yeah, things have chilled out some.  Trischal took a lot of the runners and sappers on a huge campaign to collapse the warren and clean out the rest of the moving bone piles.”</p>
<p>Pebble is staring at Amenidal, wide-eyed, petting Namib.  “Collapse the warren?  Bone piles?  What?”  She is radiating <i>extreme concern</i>. </p>
<p>Amenidal turns his smile to Pebble.  “Oh yeah!  Our new home was super infested with undead stuff.  Took us all year to take care of that.”</p>
<p>Pebble blinks, still wide-eyed.</p>
<p>Shyrendora takes a long pull from her flask.  A very long one.</p>
<p>“We’re glad you could make it. Everyone was worried after you left. What’s the new home look like, now?”</p>
<p>Amenidal’s vibrating happiness evens out some, becoming softer in a way.  “It’s...not fully home yet, but there are plans being made.  When we left, Uncle Raspy and Greg were working with the research teams to plan moving into the caverns we found.”  He pauses and glances at Shyrendora before continuing, “But the lodge looks awesome now!  You should totally come visit it someday.  Just look for the shitty sign that says The Hilt’Inn.”</p>
<p>Dhakamari perks up, “Oh! Speaking of caverns! Just a little while ago we found a big series of caves! There’s an entire underground river running through it. We went a good ways into it, but, well, caves aren’t exactly comfortable to us.” He glances toward Shadimon, “We haven’t had much luck with the cliffs, as you saw, but maybe explorable caves will be a perk for some of you coming by to help us out?” </p>
<p>Amenidal goes to speak but silences himself when Shyrendora gently touches his arm.  She gives Dhakamari a soft nod, “That sounds like an interesting discovery.  We would love to explore them one day with your leave, as well as assist with your...stone work...but it may have to wait for a little longer.  Our sappers are run thin at the moment.  Perhaps if the coming months are kind, we can send a small group your way.”</p>
<p>Amenidal bounces in his chair and eyes Shyrendora intently.</p>
<p>A sigh, “And I’m sure Amenidal would love to show them around your settlement.”</p>
<p>The smile returns to full volume. </p>
<p>Dhakamari nods eagerly, “We definitely wouldn’t want to cause you any issues, and we’re doing fine as we are right now.”</p>
<p>As conversation continues, Ehra looks over the group of elves with a look of concern on his face.</p>
<p>“I hate to ruin a good dinner,” Ehra speaks loud enough for most of the room to hear, “But has anyone heard from the totem elves?” </p>
<p>“They left before we did, didn’t they head northeast? Toward that forest area?” </p>
<p>“Weh, the flotilla is headed in tha’ direction.” Litoria gestures vaguely northish.  “We will keep Eyes open.”</p>
<p>Ehra nods, “Please do. I haven’t heard a word from them since they left. Stay in touch, if they need help we would be glad to assist how we can. Perhaps they just couldn’t make the trip for some reason.”</p>
<p>Acris is paying no attention to anything going on around him anymore.  Usually he’s a terrible eavesdropper, but today his focus is intent.  And it’s been stuck like glue on the charismatic fire elf.</p>
<p>“Thank.  You.”  Acris puts extra effort into trying to speak proper Elven.  “Can you please.  Teach me the spark.  Spell?”</p>
<p>Barrabus smiled. "I'm hardly one to turn down a fellow in need -- though be forewarned, the version I learned is bard format, four-four time. But it should work for you; you'd hardly be the first spellslinger I've taught."</p>
<p>Barrabus glanced back towards the door, and the smile slid straight off his face.</p>
<p>Advancing through the doorway was a slight young elf in simple peasant clothes, with a thin line of grey ash pasted across her forehead. She glanced briefly around the room, and then quickly marched at Ehra's seat at the table.</p>
<p>"One second, please, Acris," Barrabus said. He moved to follow the young elf, a puzzled expression on his face, but instead he swept back to the door and shoved it back open -- just in time to catch a red-haired Fire Elf collapsing through it.</p>
<p>The Fury propped herself up on Barrabus' shoulder, wheezing heavily through her bronze mask, light pouring from her exposed flesh like the sun through a silk curtain. She staggered, and then pulled herself to her feet, and began tugging her sunset-colored chiton back into reasonable shape. "Tried," she wheezed. "Tried to keep her out for a bit longer, but she's... really fast. And really hard to distract."</p>
<p>"Grandmaster Ehra," the ash-bearing elf said. She gave the older elf a sharp bow. "I am <?php echo firstcontact("Ashburn Tsun");?>, master of the Surt school and Ashwalker of Surt. Before these esteemed guests, I challenge you to a formal contest, for the honor of both our schools."</p>
<p>Ehra is up and moving before Tsun has finished speaking.</p>
<p>"Grandfather your-" Siiri tries to stop Ehra, but he silences her with a cold look.</p>
<p>The placid grandfatherly smile is gone from Ehra's face as he turns to Tsun, replaced by a face as still as steel.</p>
<p>"I am less insulted by the fact that you enter my home as a guest, approach my table that I have laid a feast for you upon, and insult not only my honor, but that of my school," Ehra speaks calmly as he ties back the waist and sleeves of his robe. He seems very frail, but walks with smooth confident steps.</p>
<p>"And moreso by the fact that anyone who ever trained under a war scholar would be <i>stupid</i> enough to do so without a sword."</p>
<p>Ehra draws his mourning blade, engraved with the names of hundreds of fallen Blade elves.</p>
<p>"You have ten seconds to find one." Ehra concludes as he settles into a ready stance about thirty feet from the Ashwalker. </p>
<p>The scene manages to finally draw Embebi’s attention away from staring at the cryptid, and a broad smile paints itself over her smirk.  Moving with confidence, she approaches the soon to erupt duel, standing about 20 feet directly behind Tsun.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell, but the black clad cryptid rolls her eyes.</p>
<p>Slabal has a slightly uncomfortable look on her face, watching Embebi closely as she approaches.</p>
<p>While Katiin keeps people back, Terje sidles up next to Barrabus.</p>
<p>"Twenty gold on battle grandpa," He whispers.</p>
<p>Barrabus shook his head. "No way I'm taking that bet," he whispered. "Ehra is going to kick her ass."</p>
<p>"Hold on," the Fury gasped. She was still bracing herself on Barrabus' shoulder. "Is... there any way we can... avoid this?</p>
<p>The Hunger hadn't moved from his seat at the table. "...I don't suppose either of you will call this off if I ask, will you?"</p>
<p>Smilisca nods briefly.</p>
<p>“Mais, ain’t noone gon’ make the attempt on ‘im if’n they don’ have some trick up them sleeves,” he says in a hushed tone.  “Weh, I’ll be takin’ ya up on dat.” </p>
<p>Barrabus sighed. "Its your money," he whispered back.</p>
<p>Ehra inclines his head toward the fire elves, but his expression does not flinch nor do his eyes waver from Tsun.</p>
<p>"Hunger, Fury, I appreciate your attempts to avoid violence in my home. I understand that this is Tsun's initiative and does not reflect upon you. That said, it is far, far too late. Four seconds, Tsun." </p>
<p>Although Embebi grows more excited as time counts down, she seems confused when she notices no one standing to either side of her.  She notices Katiin pushing people away.  She cants out once more in her odd dialect.</p>
<p>“Whatfor are you doing?  Do you wish to mock this combat? Comehence! Even lowlanders should know how to make a Trial-Circle!”</p>
<p>Slabal looks  ready to stand from her seat.  This time, she also speaks in that dialect. “Embebi, stopforth now. This is not-”</p>
<p>“Nullchat, Onagi! Silence yourself! This is not your purview or experience.  Warriors move now! Honor them with your quiet!”</p>
<p>Tsun's face remained blank, though for a second, her eyes flickered to the Hunger. "I already wield the only weapon I need," she said. "The time is yours, Grandmaster."</p>
<p>"As you wish."</p>
<p>Ehra is upon the Ashwalker in the space of a heartbeat. Tsun is fast, fast enough to enter a defensive stance, but not enough to catch the Grandmaster.</p>
<p>Ehra moves like flowing water, his economy of motion so perfect it's hard to tell he's moving as fast as he actually is. His mourning blade flashes toward Tsun's midsection, but as she moves to avoid the strike he twists the blade.</p>
<p>The thin steel of the blade flips upwards. The flatside of the blade smacks into Tsun's ear with a resounding slap that echoes through the chamber.</p>
<p>"Act like a petulant child and I treat you like one," Ehra flows into a defensive stance, "Yield before I treat you like an adult." </p>
<p>A smile flickered across Tsun's face. "Are we all children to you, Grandmaster? Or just the Fire Elves?"</p>
<p>She ducked, and then shot into Ehra's reach, before twisting and dropping an elbow towards Ehra's solar plexus. It was clearly a solid shot, connecting with Ehra with the clear, sharp chime of chainmail. Ehra didn't even flinch.</p>
<p>Tsun twisted back around and shot an open fist towards Ehra's elbow, avoiding a parry by ducking further into his grasp. Again, she connected, and again her strike rebounded off, leaving a sharp chime and a completely unfazed Ehra.</p>
<p>Her third strike went for Ehra's face, catching his shoulder instead as Ehra smoothly sidestepped around it. Again, no reaction.</p>
<p>Tsun stepped back, and shifted into a common resting stance.</p>
<p>"No, Tsun," Ehra says quietly, "I treat you only with the respect that you treat yourself."</p>
<p>He shifts the mourning blade back to an edge first grip.</p>
<p>With an incredible flash of speed, the mourning blade flashes towards the Ashwalker's throat. A flare of magic energy snaps into view, but it is too late to stop the blade.</p>
<p>With a spray of blood, Ehra drags the sword across the Ashwalker's neck. With a quick wrist motion, he pulls the blade away before it bites deep enough to be fatal.</p>
<p>The Ashwalker's eyes roll back in her head as she collapses. Ehra has wiped his blade clean and sheathed it before she even hits the ground. </p>
<p>"Healer, quicky." He barks.</p>
<p>Anasatri flaps over the table and lands next to the Ashwalker before Siiri can get there. Her hands glitter with magic and the cut quickly closes, leaving a faint mark that fades to nothing. With the immediate danger past, she grabs a napkin and cup of water from the table to clean off the blood. “Grandmaster, do you require healing?”</p>
<p>Siiri rushes to Ehra without even glancing at the fallen Ashwalker. She pulls a vial out of her bag and forces it into his hands.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Ehra is breathing heavily but in a controlled cadence.</p>
<p>"Grandfather take the damned medicine or you fight me next." Siiri snaps.</p>
<p>"I yield," Ehra's smile returns slightly as he drinks the potion. His breathing returns to normal over the next few moments.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your rapid action Anasatri," Ehra nods to her, "But the Ashwalker did not injure me in any real way. At least not yet."</p>
<p>His eyes flick to the fallen monk, then to the fire elves, "Is she always this much fun at parties?" </p>
<p>Despite having had little time to enjoy the duel, Embebi still wears an ear-to-tiny-ear grin.  Seeing most of the rest of the assembled elves are distracted elsewhere, she takes it upon herself to bodily lift the prone form of the Ashwaker.  Doing so with little effort, she carries her over to the wall Embebi was leaning on previously, propping her against it, and then settling in a looming crouch, waiting for signs of consciousness.</p>
<p>“What is ‘Ashwalker’, anyway?” Anasatri asks, dusting her hands off.</p>
<p>Smilisca quietly transfers the cash as required. Terje gives him a cheeky grin.</p>
<p>Barrabus looked at Ehra and shrugged, before quietly shoving the gold into a pocket. "No idea. I don't invite her."</p>
<p>"Ehra, dear, I'm so sorry about this," the Fury said. She had obviously taken time during the fight to hit herself with prestidigitation, but her hair was still a ruffled mess, and a faint glow lingered from her eyes and face. "The Ashwalker's actions don't represent the Triumvirate in any way, and if there's anything we need to do to make this up to you, we'll do it."</p>
<p>"She leads the Ashen," the Hunger said quietly. "They're a faction of our people with a bit... stronger of a view of the Conflagration than most."</p>
<p>Ehra holds up a hand to the Fury, "Not necessary. If anything, the apology is mine. I have seen many, many people like Tsun. The fallout for my actions will likely fall on you more than me. You do understand why I could not let that go unanswered?" </p>
<p>"Frankly, I'm simply grateful you didn't kill her," the Hunger said. He glanced at the Fury. "The Ashen can be enough of an irritant as it is."</p>
<p>The Fury rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>The Hunger turned to Ehra. "I apologize for cutting my attendance short, Ehra, but someone should escort our reprobate monk's unconscious body back to our ship. And I suppose that should be me." </p>
<p>Embebi’s expression slowly shifts from smirking to impatient.  She jabs roughly at the unconscious form.  “Up-and-sup, ristar. Dark is fled, no more bed.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Slabal has padded over to the assembly around Ehra.  Seeing his question unanswered, she instead answers for the Hunger.  “While he may understand, I do not.  Embebi is correct.  This is not my experience.  I am more ignorant of the nature of you and your… Aggro-equivalents than I should be.  Indeed, I can confidently state that I am overly ignorant of our own Aggro.  I hope to resolve this ignorance.”</p>
<p>"It is wise to admit what you do not know and ask for help to resolve it," Ehra turns to Slabal, "I am a Grandmaster of the way of the war scholar. My authority here derives from my knowledge of war and conflict, and my ability to guide my people through it - and to teach my students to do the same. Entering my hall and threatening me is a direct challenge to that and must be taken seriously. If I am not able to stop a threat in my own hall, how can I be expected to lead my elves through the horrors of a war? That is why I had to respond as such." </p>
<p>Slabal stares for a moment.  “I do not think I have sufficient context to answer your question.  I do not understand how personal martial prowess would necessarily translate to wisdom in conflict.  This seems like yet another ignorance to resolve.”</p>
<p>Embebi’s expression is now shifting from impatience to concern.  “Hrm. Not dead.  Hope you’re not headdam, ristar.  Not a good trade for not even a scar.”  She points over to Acris, shouting across the hall.  “You! Plateserver! Bring water, time for a rouse!” </p>
<p>Acris grumbles and attempts to conjure some magical source of water.  He cannot make the correct gestures and the magic fizzles out.  He wanders off to find a bucket instead.</p>
<p>"I am awake, Crag Elf," Tsun said quietly, her eyes still closed. She reached a hand to her neck, to where Ehra's sword struck her throat. "And you are correct, there is no scar. Damn."</p>
<p>Back to grin. “Ah! You pretend a corpse well, ristar.  I would have had a sad to see the first mohs I’ve seen be discarded so.  Still, you have many finer points to improve on.  Not even so much as a proper bid! Although, perhaps, better for you that you hadn’t, quiaff?”</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the Ashen elf said. "But it will serve as a start. I'll admit, I did not anticipate his armor."</p>
<p>“Well then.” Shadimon hopped down from the chair he had been perched on. “This seems as good a time as any. Dhakamari, if you would.” The two winged elves walked to the group by Ehra, the younger of the two carrying a bulky cloth bundle. He laid it on a clear spot on the table, and looked expectantly back at Shadimon.</p>
<p>“We bring a gift,” Shadimon said. “A sign of alliance, friendship, and defence, if needed.” Dhakamari unrolled the cloth bundle onto a glitter of light on metal. Shadimon picked up the first copper feather, the size of a dagger and polished to a mirror shine. “Ehra, the first for you.”</p>
<p>Ehra takes the copper blade and balances it on a finger, "Astounding craftsmanship, as always. I am quite honored by this gift, and will keep it close." He gives the winged elves a respectful bow. </p>
<p>“Hunger, Fury,” he holds out the next, decorated with beads and dyed leather. </p>
<p>"Its gorgeous!" the Fury said, darting forward to take it from Shadimon. The feather, and its leather wrappings, smoked lightly as she picked it up.</p>
<p>“Litoria, Smilisca.” He smiles, “Painted river pebbles, for yours.” </p>
<p>Litoria accepts the gift graciously, and Smilisca tips his goddamn ugly hat.</p>
<p>“Mais, but thanks for this,” Litoria says appreciatively, “it’ll be so beautiful in time, cher.”</p>
<p>“It will. Come talk to us sometime about a copper trade maybe. It looks like we have plenty of it.” He turns to Dust and holds out a long feather with multicolored beads. “For you, and your new friends.” </p>
<p>"It's beautiful. We accept it in friendship, and as a sign of the future. Our thanks." Dust tips his head in a bow. </p>
<p>Tik'Tak stands on his toes to look at it. Dust leans down a little, to give him a better view. "Neat!"</p>
<p>The next, Shadimon offers to Shyrendora. “When you’re more settled, we’d appreciate some company.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora accepts the gift silently, a small smile gracing her face before she nods.</p>
<p>Shadimon looks up at Ink and holds out a long, sharp feather with black and white decorations. “You’re welcome in our home at any time.”</p>
<p>"Thank you," Ink peers at it as he holds it delicately, "It is beautiful. Hm."</p>
<p>He rubs a finger along the rachis at the center of the crafted feather.</p>
<p>"They are pure copper," He states. After a pause, he speaks again, "I have an idea."</p>
<p>He holds the metal feather in front of him and taps it with a finger.</p>
<p>"Sending." He explains. </p>
<p>Shadimon tilts his head, “Sending?”</p>
<p>"Yes" Ink narrows his eyes, as if considering what to say, "An enchantment, copper, the focus. To speak with the others." </p>
<p>“Can you do that?” Anasatri piped up. “If we had a way to quickly talk, that would be a huge help!” </p>
<p>"A few days," Ink explains, "I have components. Yes."</p>
<p>“That would be fantastic Ink, thank you.” Shadimon looks at the last feather, and holds it out to Slabal, “For old alliances and new friendships.” </p>
<p>Slabal takes the feather, and holds it up to her face.  She stares at it intensely.</p>
<p>“The colors aren’t...ideal. This one was intended for other friends, but they aren’t here.” He points to the small feather attached to one of the beads, “This is one of my feathers. Among us, exchanging feathers is done to show that the recipient is important to you. It’s one of the ways we state our family ties.” </p>
<p>Slabal continues staring at the feather, the intense stare slowly drooping to the half-lidded one she supports by default.  “The craftselfship is well performed.  Due to the malleability of the material, it was possible to include many details that would have been otherwise difficult to represent.  The material itself is pure, and shows great care in its smelting.</p>
<p>The notion of its significance is… disingenuous.”</p>
<p>She looks straight at Shadimon, turning her eyes from the feather.</p>
<p>“The intention cannot be as you say.  I cannot be important to you. You do not know me.  While I understand the gesture may be more symbolic, I cannot accept it as one of a purely sentimental one.  For all involved, it would likely be superior for this to be a material transaction, rather than a notional one.”</p>
<p>Holding the feather with care in one hand, she roots around in a small satchel at her side.  Eventually, she draws forth a glowing icosahedron; made of pure, flawless quartz, it appears that some kind of magical light was trapped at the center.  The lensing effect of the quartz allows it to cast its light in all directions.</p>
<p>“I intended to bring this as evidence of Crag craftselfship.  An example of what we would have to provide in return for other things we desire.  As you have given me a material good, I will give you a material good.  As this one has more pragmatic value, I believe that will make up for the difference in scarcity of the two resources.”</p>
<p>She holds out the glowing prism, which is about the size of a melon.</p>
<p>Shadimon accepts the prism with a slightly bemused smile. He turns it carefully in both hands, “This is a beautiful example of your work. I think I can speak for the rest of us when I say we would be very happy to continue trading with you in the future.” </p>
<p>There’s that mechanical nod again.  “I will make sure to communicate your aesthetic preferences.  If there are other shapes you desire, that can be arranged, although some would compromise its effectiveness as a light source.” </p>
<p>Back over in the corner, Embebi turns away from the exchange, bored of the niceties.  </p>
<p>“Caught you without awareness, quiaff?  That is why the bid’s important, after all.  You might have even forced him to discard it, since all you brought were your graspers.  Newblood mistake, that, but then again, the whole exchange sort of reeked of tutime, so all is as expected.”</p>
<p>Tsun shook her head. "We 'lowlanders' do not normally 'bid' in a contest such as this was. And he would not have taken it. This way, no one can say I was offered advantage."</p>
<p>Embebi scoffs in return.  “Ack. There’s a strategy to that, but you miss the wider view.  Had you bid, bringing only your wholesome and dress, then when he clings to his clad gear he is lessened, yes?  Ah, but was not all for nothing.  You at least showed that some elf around here knows how warriors talk.”</p>
<p>She pauses for a moment.</p>
<p>“Shaming they took the scar, though.  It’s a good thing to show your ambition.  That’s how I could tell, at least, that you have the mohs of a ristar.  All of these other elves were too far to see it, gooseplops as they are.”</p>
<p>“<small>Don’t even know to make a proper circle…</small>” she mutters deeply, under her breath.</p>
<p>Tsun smiled. "Too many of us have forgotten how warriors talk, as you say. Maybe this will remind them." Her smile faded. "And here comes one who needs reminding."</p>
<p>The Hunger paced up to Tsun, his hands on his belt. "Time for us both to leave, Ashwalker," he said.</p>
<p>Embebi looks up from where she was crouching.  Slowly, she rises up to full height.</p>
<p>“We’re chatting.  You can wait, arsenical face.” </p>
<p>Acris returns with his bucket, and dutifully holds it out to the crag elf while hiccuping nervously.</p>
<p>The Hunger glared up at Embebi. A sudden spark popped up in the air around his hands. Then another. "If you're trying to intimidate me, gooseplop, get your schist together first. Before I show you exactly how paper beats rock."</p>
<p>He turned to Tsun. "Ashwalker, as <i>thrilled</i> as I am that you are reaching out to outsiders... get your ass on the damn boat. You can write your new friend a letter. Provided she can read."</p>
<p>Embebi seems genuinely taken aback at that response, particularly the sudden sparks.  Green eyebrows shoot up, and her lips draw into a tight line.</p>
<p>She looks over to the proffered bucket.</p>
<p>She grabs it in one hand, hefting it easily… and then slowly brings it to her lips, drinking deeply to buy some time.</p>
<p>She holds up one finger in the universal symbol of “one moment”.</p>
<p>Acris abandons his bucket of not-precisely-drinking-water and backs away slowly.</p>
<p>Trusting in her Crag constitution to help her earn coolkid points, the delay gives her enough time to consider her options, and comebacks.  By the time she empties the bucket, a wide grin spreads on her face. </p>
<p>“All in correctness.  I see that I did too much.  Let me correct course; I should have held onto the Nickel.  That may be more correct.“</p>
<p>She holds the bucket out at arms length, and drops it.  She then turns back to Tsun, and hooks a thumb at The Hunger.</p>
<p>“Is this guy one of your warriors, quineg?” </p>
<p>Tsun chuckled. "No, he is an administrator. He manages supplies."</p>
<p>The Hunger turned his glare back to the Ashwalker.</p>
<p>"..Which does mean I have to listen to him, I suppose." She turned, and started walking towards the doorway. </p>
<p>Embebi considers her options.  For a moment, it looks like she’s ready to leave well enough alone, in spite of her frustration.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, then she notices Slabal looking at her, cold expression boring into Embebi.  Her mouth twitches back into a grin.  She looks back to Tsun.</p>
<p>“Stay, sibkin! A demonstration is called for.  My training does not leave me defenseless here.</p>
<p>So, Maskcarrier, you are used to fighting with your mouth, quiaff?  Any good Aggro can fight that field as well.  I invoke the Rite of Refusal, calling for a revocation of your order! I fight for as much time as I please to converse with my sibkin.  I bid only what I am, what I wear, and for your handicap, I claim only the First and Second! You may claim the Third, Fourth, and Fifth; beyond these judges, in this solemn matter, let none interfere!  Now, would-be-Bakshish, what do you bid?”</p>
<p>As she says this, she tosses away her pouch and scabbards, leaving herself unarmed.</p>
<p>Katiin steps up to the group, but not between anyone.</p>
<p>With a heavy sigh she addresses the Crag elf, "Aggro Embebi, I am Warmaster General Katiin Paavi. Outside of the Grandmaster, I determine the circumstances of all personal combat within Fort Alfyr. I would like to confirm that at this time, you are talking about a conflict of words and not violence."</p>
<p>"And what the First through Fifth are," Barrabus said. "I would love to know what I'm betting on." </p>
<p>The words of the Warmaster give Embebi pause.  She seems legitimately impressed by such a long title.</p>
<p>“Ack.  To assuage Warmaster General, I will amend my bid,” confident grin, “even further down.  I bid away the use of my limbs as strikers, to be used only in my defense.  Should you wish physical conflict, Masked One, you will need to provide it.  I need none to defeat you.”</p>
<p>She pointedly ignores Barrabus, but Slabal does not.</p>
<p>“I am aware of this ritual.  I have seen it before.  When a First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth are named, it is because the results of the trial will not be immediately apparent; if no blood is drawn, no unconsciousness, no deed overcome.  The winner of the Trial is determined by simple majority.”</p>
<p>Katiin blinks slowly in a way that suggests either a potential stroke or definitive migraine.</p>
<p>"I believe I understand. Given that you are planning such a trial beforehand, it is our custom that it be held outside in the training ground. We may adjust a sparring circle for your needs. This is not a location for such events." </p>
<p>“I have made preparations thus to fight in any location.  Where we cross arms means less than nothing to me.  What say you, silent watcher? Your muteness speaks volumes of your concern.  Will you bid?  Or remain unheard?”</p>
<p>Barrabus glanced over at Smilisca. "Want your money back? I'll put twenty on the Hunger."</p>
<p>"Oh I'll speak volumes; you'll get a damn anthology," the Hunger replied. "I will take third, fourth, and fifth, and bid myself and my attire. And for your handicap, Crag Elf, I'll bid that I will refrain from physical contact with you unless initiated by yourself or outside influence, and that I won't let my natural heat blind you or set you on fire. And out of kindness, I'll try to only use words you can understand -- or at least sound out if you try hard enough." He turned to Katiin. "Lead on, Warmaster. Let's get this over with."</p>
<p>Smilisca, to Barrabus, "Weh, I'll take it she knows the rules abetter, or she maken em up."</p>
<p>Barrabus nodded, grinning. "Its your money. Or is right now."</p>
<p>Terje’s eyes slowly go wide as he watches the money change hands. He gently touches Smilisca on the arm.</p>
<p>“Cher, I’ll meet you outside.” Terje practically legs it out the door, apparently for something important.</p>
<p>Katiin watches her brother run off with careful patience.</p>
<p>“If you have decided who will be officially participating in this trial, I will lead you to the training grounds where we will prepare an appropriate setting. If any others wish to observe,” She sighs, “feel free, unless our guests disagree.”</p>
<p>Embebi looks excited.  “A reasonable bid, I had expected more.  Bargained well, and done! I will now take my First and Second.”</p>
<p>She points at Tsun. “Of course, Ashwalker, you will be my First.  I can think of no finer of this assembly.”</p>
<p>And then turns back to Katiin.  “And you, Warmaster General, I would have as my Second.  Though I do not know you as well, you seem to be free of risk fear, to interrupt a trial for the benefit of your...  guests?” she hazards, somewhat mispronouncing this last word.</p>
<p>“Aggro, I cannot participate as a judge in this trial. My position is to observe, as a completely neutral party, for the benefit of the Fort and those therein.” Katiin seems almost relieved to have an answer. </p>
<p>“A disappointing answer, but not one without reason.  Very well.  Another with a keen ear and a stout heart will be required.”</p>
<p>She taps her large foot, slapping softly on the floor, as she thinks.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”  She points over to Acris.  “You, plateserver, moved to aid.  It is not a perfect fit, but I can think of few others who properly demonstrated duty today.  Will you serve as my Second?” </p>
<p>Acris nods enthusiastically while Litoria rolls her eyes dramatically.</p>
<p>The Hunger nodded. "Then I will claim Leafstorm. He's an experienced bard, and can be trusted to remain impartial -- though feel free to disagree, if you think you aren't good enough for his judgement.</p>
<p>"Anasatri, as the Winged Elves lorekeeper, will serve as a good fourth. Finally... Pebble."</p>
<p>Anasatri grimaced a little as Shadimon sighed gustily, but she hopped up and went to stand by the Hunger. </p>
<p>Barrabus glanced at Smilisca. "Still on?"</p>
<p>Smilisca looks at the apprentice with stars in his eyes.  “<i>Weh.</i>”</p>
<p>As the attendees trooped out to go watch the spectacle, Shadimon and Dhakamari moved to sit near Shyrendora. Shadimon silently held out his hand toward her in mute appeal. </p>
<hr/>
<a href="02_0b.php"><h4 id="cont">Continued...</h4></a>
<hr/>
<p>Distracted by watching Amenidal join the crowd of onlookers, Shyrendora misses the new additions to her seating arrangement.  She does not miss the hand though.  She takes a long, hard swallow before placing her flask into the hand and following it to give Shadimon an understanding look. </p>
<p>Shadimon takes a long drink, only twitching a little bit. “For the record,” he says, glancing at Slabal, “Starting fights at diplomatic meals is generally frowned upon.”</p>
<p>Ehra sighs as he takes his seat next to Siiri again, “At least she’s not going to physically hurt anyone this time. That was not a pleasant moment.”</p>
<p>In the background, Ink has moved over to the bloodstain. He makes a few quick hand gestures that anyone with any knowledge of magic at all recognize as prestidigitation. Oddly, the tattoo on his chest moves in a circular spiraling pattern as he casts. He calmly begins cleaning the bloodstain.</p>
<p>Slabal, who had kind of… spaced out… during most of the preceding events now turned to Shadimon.  It seems to take her a moment to register the advice.</p>
<p>“Ah.  Another ignorance.  As already one trial, and a far more… brutal… one had already been conducted, I had not realized that another was an inconvenience.  Yet another lacking in cultural context.  It could have been avoided, however.  It is not wise for other bloodlines to purposefully seek to intimidate or browbeat an Aggro.  Perhaps this is also cultural context that I should have shared.”</p>
<p>“The first ‘trial’ was entirely out of line too, and that was a case of ignoring and deliberately breaking rules. But that’s enough. I’m tired of fighting. Ehra, you said before that you had heard wolves nearby. Whereabouts? We can go scouting in the morning.”</p>
<p>“That was Hunger,” Ehra notes, “We have been blissfully wolfless down here, though I hear there have been many sightings up north. Litoria… You said this Lycan actually travelled with you for several days?”</p>
<p>“Weh.”  Litoria nods, “We ‘surprised an <i>elf</i> on the riverbank, ‘en invited her to come ‘n sit a spell.  Didn’t find out she wadn’t no elf till she was leavin’.”</p>
<p>“So… the Lycan just… hung around?” Ehra scratches his chin, “Litoria, I’ve seen you spot a Lycan spy within seconds of coming near you. This one stayed with you for days and didn’t draw any suspicion?”</p>
<p>This conversation now has Slabal’s <i>full</i> attention.  </p>
<p>Shyrendora also has an attentive ear turned towards Ehra and Litoria.</p>
<p>“Mais, she carried a silver sword.  She were polite.  She sat ‘n talked over meals wi’ us.  An’ she e’en took ‘er boots off on da raft.”  Litoria hangs her head, looking conflicted.  “Wasn’t nuthin bout her that mighta said she were a wolf.  She seemed...” she trails off, like she can’t quite finish the statement.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t accusing you of imperceptiveness,” Ehra quickly clarifies, “Just trying to understand. Hunger said she looked like a blade elf… can you describe her for me?”</p>
<p>“Weh, a’course.  She were about yey tall,” she gestures close to her ears, “with pointy ears like a blade elf, ‘n real white hair.”</p>
<p>"To be honest, that does sound a lot like her behavior in Surt," the Fury said, dropping into a seat nearby.</p>
<p>Ehra looks distant, “I can’t say I know any wolves with white fur, but… I’ve met blade elves with white hair. Vatik family, mostly. Bought by a Skati. I believe… Hm… I’ll have to try to remember the werewolf clan that purchased them. It was oh, over two centuries ago. Before we rebelled. Perhaps they are related.” </p>
<p>Shadimon flicked his ears back, “And she showed multiple forms. Correct me if I’m wrong, but that means born Lycan, not afflicted, yes? And to be a blade elf...well, the blade elves are, ah, relatively new. Has to almost be a first generation sort of thing, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Veraseggr!” Ehra snaps his fingers, “That was the clan. Hm? Yes, that seems likely. I doubt an afflicted would have the level of control that was described. And a blade elf… Yes, first generation seems likely.” </p>
<p>“That seems like...a recipe for conflict. Within the clan? Or personally. Divided loyalties, maybe.” </p>
<p>"Traveling alone implies she might be the only generation," the Fury said, deliberately not looking at Ehra. "And that might explain her actions, too."</p>
<p>“Well, having been discovered, I suspect she’ll be laying very, very low for awhile. Even if she didn’t know about this little get-together, she has to know that the fire elves would pass word to everyone else.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora tilts her head to the side.  “That sounds like a lonely existence.” </p>
<p>Shadimon drummed his fingers on the table, “Didn’t you both mention camps? And one of those was full of dead people marked with Lycan runes? That was near Surt, I think, Fury? So there may be more Lycans out there, or this one very prolific one.”</p>
<p>The Fury gave a nervous grin. "Well, hon... I don't think they're related. I wasn't there at the time, you know -- too busy getting buried by a rockslide -- but from what I got from the Hunger, and a few of my friends that were listening in... this White Werewolf of ours didn't start out violent. She seemed more interested in visiting than actual conflict. The Hunger might even have gotten her out peacefully if the Terror had delayed a minute longer."</p>
<p>"If they're related, I think our campers are following her. And she may not even be aware of it."</p>
<p>The Fury continued. “And that also assumes the two camps are related. One only featured some pretty big wolf tracks, and a few tents. And you don’t need Lycans to leave wolf tracks.”</p>
<p>“The point is,” Ehra adds, “That we know <i>nothing</i> for sure about this Lycan, other than that she is not immediately violent. It is possible she means us no harm and is alone, it is possible that she is an agent for a group. There are no safe assumptions for us to make.” </p>
<p>“<i>Immediately</i>,” the Fury said, flashing finger-quotes.</p>
<p>“To be fair, Fury,” Ehra smiles a little, “Recent experience shows it doesn’t take much to set fire elves alight.”</p>
<p>“True, wolves don’ mean werewolves.”  Litoria appears to chew on the thought.  “Migh’ e’en be our missing Totem Elves.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good point. They certainly had dire wolves of their own.” Shadimon resettled his wings with a quiet rustle.</p>
<p>Slabal, who had been listening intently, now finally finds that she cannot remain silent any longer.</p>
<p>“I attempted to curtail context from what I was hearing, but found that there must be some fundamental knowledge which I lack.  The word you are using to describe this person… seems extremely similar to the name which the <span class="animal">Animals</span> used to refer to themselves.  I cannot help but think that there is some unfortunate coincidence there.  I would appreciate a clarification.”</p>
<p>There is definitely a different tone and inflection in there… something which had been absent from the otherwise placid speaking manner she typically affects.</p>
<p>“Of course, Slabal,” Ehra turns, “I believe you are correct. The Lycans, lycanthropes, werewolves, are the ones who we fought together at Skaplyndi.” </p>
<p>Mechanical nod. “Yes.  It is good to confirm that.  But it further confuses me.  You used these terms in conjunction with… with someone who… someelf who travelled with you, went to you, found you, and did not kill you.  Or attempt to, in specific.  I cannot help but feel you are mistaken.  Such actions do not make sense in that context.”</p>
<p>“We won the war.”  Litoria’s voice is finding its steadiness again.  “Erry’thin’ they had ‘s been destroyed, weh.  There’s nah a Lycan culture lef’ fer her to be a’par. <span class="tooltip">C’est vrai.<span class="tooltiptext">It's true</span></span>”  She looks into her webbed palms.  “C’est vrai.  Pourquoi?  Why woul’ she not choose ‘n elf’s life ‘stead?”</p>
<p>Slabal stares at Litoria.  And keeps staring.  And then a little more.</p>
<p>She closes her eyes, and a small expression of strain crosses her features.  A small burst of <span class="tooltip">magic<span class="tooltiptext"><i>Comprehend Language</i> as an SLA, for reference</span></span> wavers around her.</p>
<p>When she opens her eyes again, there is a mild yellow glow to them. </p>
<p>“This should help.  Please, try to convey that information to me again.” </p>
<p>Litoria, unfortunately, is maybe less good at the attempt to remove her accent from her speech.</p>
<p>“There ain’t a Lycan civilisation fer her to belong to.”  Attempting to speak clearly seems to be clarifying something for Litoria too.  “Mais, she wan’ belong as en elf instead.”</p>
<p>Shadimon nods in Litoria’s direction, “The Lycans are done and now this is where all the elves are congregating. Where else is there to go? Especially with her being a wolf, being alone has to be hard.”</p>
<p>“Free will,” Ink says with a raspy voice. He is sitting at the table, as if he has been there all along. </p>
<p>Slabal whips her head to look at him.  She blinks.</p>
<p>“...There can be no issue of misunderstanding.  You are speaking of this… individual… as though they are not a threat.  I concede, this may be true, but I do not think that that truth can rest alongside a truth of her being… There are other creatures in The World.  Ones with morphing properties.  I do not know them as well, but if we were to reference The First-”</p>
<p>She stops short.</p>
<p>“... I think that my opinion on this may be corrupted by different information.  There is a chance that even with total understanding, there is a fundamental misunderstanding.  Regardless, I would advise that if you do believe this person to truly be an <span class="animal">Animal</span>, it would not be wise to feel any need to protect or succor her.  They have done nothing to deserve such feelings.  I believe the balance is extended greatly in the other direction.”</p>
<p>"I would not say she is not a threat," the Fury said. "She was as volatile as I've ever known them to be. Both the Hunger and the Terror can attest to that."</p>
<p>“As much as I would like to believe that this Lycan seeks comfort,” Erha frowns, “Let us not forget, her civilization is not simply gone. We destroyed it. We killed her Lord. If she is suffering, we are the architects of it. In her position, what would you feel?” </p>
<p>“Lost,” Shadimon says shortly. “Angry. We know those feelings, don’t we.” </p>
<p>“... In that position,” Slabal says, her tone deeper than usual, “I would feel… as I do.  As all Crag do.  As all Crag currently now living do.  What they have done extends beyond mere destruction and death.  What they have done Sundered the P-  What they have done has destroyed the future, as well.”</p>
<p>Ink give Slabal a sideways look while she speaks, but says nothing.</p>
<p>Shyrendora swirls her flask lightly.  “The best to take from this conversation, is to proceed with caution and to keep an eye out.  What comes will come.” </p>
<p>“The future is never gone,” Dhakamari says quietly. “That’s the one thing no one can take from us.”</p>
<p>Litoria looks around, and briefly hopes for a translator.  And then, in fluid, perfect Sylvan she continues.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip">“<i>Dreyrugr est mort. Sa nation est tombée. Nous avons marché jusqu'à la guerre, avons traversé le continent et d'autres, et avons atteint notre objectif. Nous avions l'habitude, nous étions gaspillés et nous ne pouvons jamais rentrer chez nous, même si nous aspirons à la maison. Si nous mettons les autres sur cette voie, ce n'est pas à notre avantage. Nous avons vaincu leur pays: nous n'avons pas besoin d'exécuter son peuple jusqu'au dernier. Les courants du temps s'écoulent sans cesse dans les canaux que nous avons creusés le plus profond. Ne creusons pas celui-ci plus profondément.</i>”<span class="tooltiptext">Thanks, Google Translate.</span></span></p>
<p>“Mmm,” Ink mumbles, “Moment.”</p>
<p>Ink holds up a hand. He moves his fingers in short sharp gestures as he clearly casts a <span class="tooltip">spell<span class="tooltiptext">Ventriloquism</span></span>. Black markings wrap around his fingers as he opens his hand. An intricate tattoo design appears in his open palm. From his hand, Litoria’s voice issues speaking her words again in perfect accentless elven. </p>
<p>“<i>Dreyrugr is dead.  His nation has fallen.  We marched to war, crossed the continent and then some, and accomplished our goal.  We were used, wasted, and we can never go home, though home is what we yearn for.  If we put others on that course toward us it is not to our benefit.  We have defeated their nation: we do not need to execute its people to the last.  The currents of time flow ever in the channels we cut the deepest.  Let’s not dig this one deeper.</i>”</p>
<p>Litoria looks really confused to hear herself speaking... actual elven.  It’s like an out-of-body experience.</p>
<p>Ink shrugs at her.</p>
<p>The Fury watched Ink's casting with no small amount of interest. "Interesting spell," she said. "Is that a natural ability, or a structured casting?"</p>
<p>"Latter," Ink replies curtly.</p>
<p>"I’d like to take a look at that spell, if you’d let me. But back on the main topic... It’s worth noting that there may be others out there we haven't spotted yet. We wouldn't even have noticed 'the Tourist', as the Hunger calls her, if the Terror hadn't ordered the guards to watch out for spies," the Fury continued. </p>
<p>“We’ve set up a ward around our village. Might not be a bad idea for you to do as well, if there’s at least one Lycan who can disguise herself <i>that</i> well,” Shadimon adds. He ran a hand over his face, tired. “But speaking of villages, Fury, how is your new home coming?”</p>
<p>"A ward is a wonderful idea," the Fury said. "I'll see what we can arrange -- especially if you can give us a few pointers. I do have some great ideas for a bronze arcano-support infrastructure across the whole town, but that relies heavily on getting a large supply of copper. And also finding a strong enough tin source in the mountains, though we've found traces of that, at least. </p>
<p>"But overall, we're not bad," she continued, smiling with only a little smugness. "The Hunger's got his big gardening project -- its nothing too fancy, though the aqueduct system <i>is</i> very nice." She sighed. "Sadly, I've had a bit less luck overall. We've had disaster after disaster when it comes to scouting our general area, and while we did manage to come up with a pretty decent mineral location ritual... let's just say I found out firsthand why you shouldn't hardcode wildcards into your rituals. The migraine finally wore off last week."</p>
<p>Dust, having wandered over a few minutes earlier, winced sympathetically.  "We had a similar issue, building a ritual to locate water sources. Our casters were down with a migraine for <i>months</i>. I'm sorry you had a similar issue, but I must say, it's nice to know we weren't alone in our error." </p>
<p>“Fortunately things have been mostly quiet for us. But, we did find the remains of a village nearby. Looked like a conflict between local groups, no Lycans. But it was very...thorough destruction. We’ve settled into the cliffs, though, and things seem safe for now. The only other excitement was Dhakamari’s heroic flight.” Shadimon ruffled the blushing younger elf’s feathers.</p>
<p>"Hmm. I'm very glad those feathers will let us communicate quickly. I keep hearing about news that we missed. I had been considering offering the use of a few of our people as messengers." Dust sighed. "I'm glad things are going well now, at least." </p>
<p>Slabal’s attention was drawn while The Fury was speaking.  Now, sensing a moment of silence, she interjects.</p>
<p>“You had mentioned Gardening.  I would like to ask why a Gardening project is necessary for you.  I might have valuable information to… I may have information at hand.” </p>
<p>"We live in a somewhat acrid area," the Fury said. "Lots of volcanic activity, significant numbers of geysers, etc. The temperature is nice, and the area is rich with arcanic materiale, but the soil has to be tempered in order to not poison our crops. I don't know much of the specifics, unfortunately -- its the Hunger's big project, and it took him all year to get it working -- but it involves a very complicated aqueduct system stemming from the nearby mountains, and a lot of water and soil filtration. But we'd be more than happy to listen to you, and share some of our own, if you want."</p>
<p>“..Ah.  Similar issues, but different causes.  My information is not actually of any particular use.  Given the telling nature of the query, however, it does me little good to keep obfuscating the purpose of my presence.</p>
<p>We, too, have been… suffering from a malady which has reduced our agricultural potential.  I was given a task by the Esteemed to seek out you L-Otherelves in order to see if there was any material that we could impart upon you in return for agricultural product.  It is her understanding of lore that such barter and exchange is the commonly accepted practice.  The Light which I exchanged earlier was an example of such.</p>
<p>Thus, it leads to a straightforward query; who among you has surplus agriculture? If any?”</p>
<p>Shadimon tilts his head for a moment, thinking, “We’re working on it. We have farms established, and we’re also working on a garden project. But we’re in the southern mountains, and it’s arid there. We have a good variety of things we <i>think</i> will grow. I don’t think we have a surplus yet, but given another growing season, we should be open to trade.” </p>
<p>“Meat, though,” Dhakamari adds, glancing at Shadimon before continuing. “There’s very good hunting in the forests above the canyon.” </p>
<p>"We have surplus food," Ehra states, "Mostly simple staples, like the potatoes you see here. I would have to get Terje for specifics, but we would be happy to trade, especially for iron." </p>
<p>Slabal nods at Ehra.  “That sounds as though it is an ideal exchange.  Much iron lays in and around our home, predominantly in the form of haematite.”</p>
<p>Reaching into her satchel, she draws forth another example- a pure, untainted crystal of haematite. She places it gently on the table.</p>
<p>“While we have not established wide scale extraction, for we have only some industrial uses for the substance, it would not be difficult to expand these.”</p>
<p>Ehra takes the crystal between his thumb and forefinger, "Fascinating. Incredible purity. Slabal, is this a typical example of the quality of material you can provide?" </p>
<p>She stares for a moment.  “I do not think I could guarantee that same purity from wide scale extraction; that is a typical example of what we currently obtain, usually after the useful material has been willed away from it.  For purposes of speed and scalability, however, I believe that significantly increased output would prevent us from meticulously removing said material, unless said purity is a required condition of our agreement.” </p>
<p>"I don't suppose you could do the same with copper?" the Fury said. "We have a serious need for some bronze."</p>
<p>Stare. “I am… I do not know of any significant deposits of that material near our home.  It is possible that some exist, but most we find are quite limited in scale, or utility.  However, which bronze alloy do you prefer?” </p>
<p>Shadimon waved a hand, “We have the copper, and I suspect that’s going to be our major export, if the river elves are willing to haul it all the way up north.” </p>
<p>"Seven parts copper to one part tin," the Fury said. "Or seven parts copper, one part tin, one part lead, for specific high-flexibility applications. And to be honest, we'll trade with whomever can supply it. So if you've got something in mind that you want for it, Shadimon, consider us interested."</p>
<p>“Weh, we’ll be there, eventually.”  Litoria shrugs.  “Righ’ now we’re still mappin’ the currents to fin’ optimal routes.”</p>
<p>"Slabal," Ehra folds his hands, "A blade elf is not a blade elf without iron. We are eager to make an equitable exchange. There is, however, a complication. You have yet to tell us of your home. Including where we may find it to trade." </p>
<p>Slabal stares.  You can actually see her lip curl a bit.  She opens her mouth a couple times, but stops short.</p>
<p>After these false starts, she finally manages. “That… is a significant obstacle.  I have tried to consider numerous ways to overcome it, but few seem… practical.  Perhaps some context.</p>
<p>Our home is called Eschaton.  It is the last of our settlements.  For many generations, it was not; that changed when we were discovered by the- when we were discovered.  </p>
<p>That we had gone so long undisturbed, and that when discovered we suffered so greatly, forms a core part of the cultural strategy of the Crag.  It is believed that when we are obscured, we are safe.  If others cannot find us, they cannot harm us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that strategy clashes with this new need.  I had considered one option, that the Crag would conduct all trade ourselves, bringing our goods to these lands, and returning.  After having traversed the distance myself, that option seems… impracticable. At least in the short term.</p>
<p>One other option that has seemed somewhat practicable would involve the services of these River Elves.  Although I did not know of them beforehand, it is my understanding that they are capable and willing of facilitating transit of goods upon waterways.  There are some of these near my home which, while in part revealing our location, would allow the specifics to remain obscured, and minimize the difficulties in travelling in these… chaotic lands.</p>
<p>But to know if that is worth considering, I would need to know what is expected in return for this service.”</p>
<p>“Mais, if only we had a Navigator righ’ bou’ now.”  Litoria grumbles to herself a bit, giving the doorway a sideways glance.  Directly to Slabal, she continues:</p>
<p>“We ain’t gon’ take trade good for our own if’n we don’ need it.  We expec’ safe passage, libertie for maintainin’ the riverbanks, an sometime, we have ta buil’ tools fer travel that are permanen’.  Jus’ don’ tear em down.  Et breaks ‘dem engineers’ hearts.”</p>
<p>Stare. Blinkblink. Stare.  You’re starting to get the impression that she’s not actually trying to be unreadable… she just reads… differently.</p>
<p>“It is unexpected to see such an understanding of pragmatic consumption.  The briefing I received indicated that other cultures typically expected recompense for any service rendered, even ones with little effort on their part.  If all you require is full command over these waterways, I can confidently state that these hold little interest to the Crag.  Such an embarrassment of moisture is… non-trivial to endure.”</p>
<p>Back to Ehra.  “If these river elves are willing, I can indicate that our home is… speaking in very uncertain, and deliberately obfuscated terms… located in the Mountain range to the north of the very… Lake? Sea? I am uncertain.  This body of water you are adjacent to.  If we could arrange for our traded goods to be exchanged upon the banks directly to the north of this settlement, I believe that would achieve a manageable balance of convenience to concealment.”</p>
<p>Oh. Oh No. Oh no oh no oh no oh no.</p>
<p>Litoria looks suddenly <i>deeply concerned</i>.  “<i>Which</i> of the rivers to the north?  Partager is headed into that swamp as we speak.”</p>
<p>Head turn, stare, pause.  “I must admit to another ignorance.  I do not know the proper names, nor how to describe, nor, truly, the number of rivers which rest to the north.  I would need… would need Embebi for that.  She is much more knowledgeable of these terrains and climes.  My rudimentary understanding is that merely at the very banks to this ‘swamp’ would be sufficient.” </p>
<p>She stares at Litoria for an uncomfortable moment.</p>
<p>“I may be incorrect, but I think you are concerned.  Is the place I suggested dangerous?  Or prohibited by culture?  Is this Partager some kind of beast, or disaster?”</p>
<p>“Partager is our flotilla.  It is us.”  Litoria gestures with her webbed hands.  “Mais, we don’t know you’re there.  We ‘spect ta find the Totem Elves up in ther, but if’n your privacy’s so vital we could wander too close by mistake.”</p>
<p>Blink. Stare into distance.  “... I see.  If you had intended to search into the mountains for the… the Totem Elves… it is possible you could find our home instead.  I can understand how that might be a concern.”  </p>
<p>Eyes widen.</p>
<p>“...Particularly because of Echo,” she says to no one in particular.</p>
<p>"I can take you to Partager." Ink is suddenly standing directly next to Litoria.</p>
<p>Shadimon had opened his mouth, and slowly closes it again when Ink speaks. </p>
<p>“Can you take Smilisca?” Litoria gestures toward the door.  “He’s the Navigator.”</p>
<p>"Of course." Ink frowns, "Time is a factor?"</p>
<p>“Weh.”</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Ink stands up straight and taps the tattoo on his chest. The tattoo spins and spreads over his entire upper body as he begins to speak an incantation in an ancient form of elven. As the tattoo spreads to his arms, <span class="tooltip">he vanishes in a wisp of shadow.<span class="tooltiptext">Dimension door</span></span></p>
<h2 id="jump"></h2>
<hr/>
<p>"I just made so much money," Terje is saying to Smilisca.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Terje's self satisfied smirk evaporates.</p>
<p>Ink is standing behind Smilisca with eyes glowing like blacklights and fractal tattoos snaking under the skin of his entire upper body.</p>
<p>"You will come with me." He rasps.</p>
<p>He blinks.</p>
<p>"Says Litoria. Please."</p>
<p>Terje silently grabs Smilisca's arm.</p>
<p>"He can come."</p>
<p>Before anyone else can say anything, Ink begins to chant another incantation causing the tattoos to swirl even more before he places his hands on both of them and all three disappear in a rush of air and shadows. </p>
<p>Amendial stares wide-eyed at the spot the three previously occupied.  Softly, he whispers "That...was so cool."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ehra coughs. "Uh…. I suppose that worked." </p>
<p>Shadimon puts his hands over his face, wings shaking with barely withheld laughter, “I hope he tells Smisca what message he’s supposed to be passing on.”</p>
<p>“Weh, <i>‘ope</i>.”  Litoria stares at the place the cryptid used to be.</p>
<p>From outside, all can hear a high-pitched wail, that quickly dopplers right into the room:</p>
<p>"Taaaaaaaaaaante!”</p>
<p>The door thuds open and Acris slides inside, cloak askew and hair ruffled.  He scurries to Litoria and runs full-tilt into Sauver’s side.  The hippo placidly munches a cabbage.</p>
<p>He’s trying to describe what just happened, but is using Sylvan at very high speed and is impossible to follow.</p>
<p>“Looks like Ink found them,” Shadimon whispers to Dhakamari.</p>
<p>The door has hardly closed when Katiin boots it back open and storms the room like it was an enemy battle line.</p>
<p>"Why the <i>fuck</i> did Ink just kindnap my brother?" She asks, considerably louder than necessary.</p>
<p>Shadimon can’t help it; on top of everything else that has happened tonight, he turns and arches a wing between himself and the table, letting the feathers muffle his laughter. </p>
<p>After several minutes of activity, Slabal is finally required to blink.  When she does so, she opts to leave her eyes closed for a solid 5 seconds.</p>
<p>When they open again, they return to their normal, half-lidded state.</p>
<p>“I have several questions.”</p>
<p>She turns first to Litoria.</p>
<p>“Is that activity capable of averting the potential confound of Crag discovery by your people?”</p>
<p>"Es possible," Litoria answers, not sure exactly what just happened.</p>
<p>“Given your previous experience, I will place significant value on your evaluation.”</p>
<p>She then turns to Ehra.</p>
<p>“Produce for Iron is the crux of our agreement.  The phrase ‘Time is a Factor’ is a compelling one.  I will echo it now.  I can state with confidence that I should have no trouble collecting surplus Iron; when I return to Eschaton, I will collect as much as can be had on hand.  My intention is to make this bounty available on the now-narrowly-avoided banks before the season is completed.  Would you make the same commitment?”</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Ehra affirms, "I will have to wait for someone to return my logistics expert before I can plan anything too specific, but in the meantime I have a suggestion. The mild winter left us with a reasonably solid surplus, and you say time is a factor. I am prepared to allow you to take the first portion of the shipment with you when you leave, as much as you can safely carry. This is not a gift or a statement of good intentions, but instead a reflection of honor. I am confident that the crag elves will commit to this trade, as you Slabal have shown steadfastness. So I am willing to send the first portion knowing you will return the trade in kind. Is this acceptable?”</p>
<p>Stare. Nod. “It is acceptable to excess. It is truly intriguing, and informative, to see that many of the ideals held by our ancestors have echoed to today.  Embebi and I were not the only ones to make the journey- the others were merely more hesitant to encroach on your settlement.   I will see to it that they discard this untoward notion.”</p>
<p>She then turns to The Fury.</p>
<p>“I do not think that, in the short term, I can do anything for your copper needs.  If it is a different alloy you desire, I am aware of new deposits we have discovered, which likely include some trace arsenopyrite. This is how our forebears created their bronze, before the capacity to reliably work with iron was developed.  Otherwise, I can perhaps think of something which may appeal to the originator of your Gardening Project… but I do not think he will be keen to discuss it now, given the circumstances.  Do you think that This Hunger would be capable and willing to perhaps discuss it at a later date, perhaps by… by… by magical feather. ?” </p>
<p>The Fury nodded. "Unfortunately, arsenical bronze can produce lethal fumes when exposed to high temperatures for long periods of time, so we can't use that on a large scale. But I'm sure the Hunger would be more than capable of discussing future agricultural prospects with you; the Gardens are stable for now, but he has already been making plans to expand them."</p>
<p>Nod. Blink. Head turn to Shadimon.</p>
<p>“Are you well?  Do you have brain damage?”</p>
<p>Shadimon ruffled his wings and refolded them, “Entirely well. This entire evening has just been so completely ridiculous, it’s either I laugh or I start swearing. We tend to favor laughter as a response.” </p>
<p>Pause.  “So… all of these proceedings <i>were</i> abnormal?”</p>
<p>“Pretty much, yes. Though I suppose it was mostly a miracle that we avoided an open fight last year.” </p>
<p>“...I do not think I have enough exposure or context to determine whether or not that is relieving.”</p>
<p>One more turn, this time to Katiin.</p>
<p>“That individual, that you called Ink.  It appears to be elf...esque… in appearance.  Is it, or is this a coincidence?”</p>
<p>“I-” Katiin starts.</p>
<p>“Nope.” The other cryptid is sitting on the other side of the table, munching on the last of the fish snacks with her feet propped up on the edge of the table, “Elf.”</p>
<p>“Fuck it.” Katiin sits down and pours a glass of wine. </p>
<p>Slabal glances over to the Cryptid elf.  She blinks.</p>
<p>“Your capabilities are disconcerting.  I am not used to missing details.  It is alarming that your response could be moreso.”</p>
<p>The cryptid shrugs and tosses a fish snack into her mouth.</p>
<p>Slabal gazes back at Katiin.</p>
<p>“And the other individual.  The small one.  With scaled skin.  This is also an elf?”</p>
<p>Katiin takes a slow sip of the wine, “No. The dreamdust elves made peace with a tribe of lizardfolk they had come into contact with. He was allowed to come as an… envoy to ensure they stay at peace.” </p>
<p>“Ah.”  Pause.  Her gaze unfocuses, and Slabal just ends up staring at a reflection of a half-finished dish on the table.  “That answer is definitively reassuring.  It is good to know there are some limitations on how morphologically different elves can be.”</p>
<p>Another long pause.</p>
<p>“I have finished with my questions.”</p>
<p>"Well then I have a few," the Fury said. She turned to the Cryptid. "First off... what's your name?"</p>
<p>“Skulk.” Munch munch. </p>
<p>"Cool, cool, easy one out of the way. Sooo," the Fury continued, "Is there a <i>lot</i> of unusual magical forms in this area, or can you point me towards some of it? I noticed Ink has some highly unusual capabilities, and I've... been looking for some unusual sources of magic on my own. I have a friend I'm looking for, you might say."</p>
<p>Skulk shrugs, “It’s all wizard shit to me.”</p>
<p>Munch munch. </p>
<p>Shadimon’s face goes through some amazing contortions, but he manages to hold it together. </p>
<p>The Fury made a face. "Doesn't seem like Ink cares to talk about it much, I noticed. Any... particular reason for that? That you know of?"</p>
<p>“Yep.” Skulk has run out of snacks. She seems annoyed. </p>
<p>Dhakamari shoves the platter of flatbreads over toward her.</p>
<p>Skulk makes a face at it, “Nah.” </p>
<p>The Fury rolled her eyes. "Then don't suppose you've seen a phoenix wandering around the area then have you?"</p>
<p>“Only yours,” Skulk resolves to spin the plate on her fingertip by its edge.</p>
<p>Skulk pauses and catches the plate in her hands. She frowns and glances at Fury.</p>
<p>“Barrabus,” She notes.</p>
<p>Skulk goes back to spinning the dish and ignoring everyone.</p>
<p>"Seven unique flavors of damnation," the Fury sighed. "I was really hoping you didn't mean him."</p>
<p>“Yep.” </p>
<p>Shadimon raises an eyebrow at Fury, “A phoenix?”</p>
<p>"Friend of mine from way back. Big, fiery, bird-shaped. ...Though that reminds me. I take it back, Slabal," the Fury said, turning back towards the Crag Elf. "There is one metal we can always use. Silver."</p>
<p>Slabal is still staring at the table, the way she stares at things.</p>
<p>“If we had that in great quantity,” she intones, slightly lower pitched, “perhaps a great many things would be different.”</p>
<p>There is a long, solemn silence.</p>
<p>It is interrupted by light snoring.</p>
<p>“Grandfather,” Siiri touches his shoulder, speaking for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Ehra starts awake, “Oh… I apologize.”</p>
<p>“It is quite late,” Siiri looks at the group, “I know some of you are nocturnal, but we aren’t. Look, no one’s trying to kill anyone else or do any weird trials or anything, so I think we’re just going to go to bed while we have a chance.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ehra muffles a yawn, “Quite a bit was accomplished, I think. I do have one last request. I won’t tell anyone how to handle it, but… if anyone meets this tourist, please tell the rest of us as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“They will, grandfather, come on.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m not <i>that</i> old.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you are.”</p>
<p>Ehra stifles a laugh. “You’re all welcome to stay at the Fort for a few days to make any arrangements needed. I hope we see you all well again next year.”</p>
