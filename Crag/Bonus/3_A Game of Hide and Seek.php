    </p>
    <p>While Embebi is out training her new Stalkers in escape and evasion, she is somewhat frustratingly discovered by Vesnia.</p>
    <p>Vesnia confronts her when she is separated from her trainees by a significant distance. Unlike last time, she confronts her alone, with only two other riders concealed nearby keeping watch. She signals that she wants to talk, not fight. She dismounts her wolf and has a sealed waxed leather satchel with her.</p>
    <p>"Why Embebi, if I didn't know any better I would say you were avoiding me." </p>
    <p>Stock still, eyes drinking in as much detail as possible, Embebi regards Vesnia with a cold expression.  Her hands do not stray from her bow, an arrow already knocked- although it is a fruitless gesture.  The shaft is clearly blunted, no danger to anyone.</p>
    <p>The wry smile usually set upon her face has vanished, replaced by a sour look.  Yet, she makes an effort to keep the full extent of her vitriol from her voice.</p>
    <p>“A curious assertion.  Mayhaps be my vision of things, but it doesn’t seem to me that one can avoid another, unless the two were <i>supposed</i> to meet.  To me, I’d say this seems that if I didn’t know any better, that you were a-hunting me.”</p>
    <p>Vesnia frowns in return, “If I am, know that it’s for your own good. I am <i>trying</i> to prevent you from making a severe mistake.”</p>
    <p>She slowly unshoulders the satchel, and even more slowly opens it. Inside, as promised, are the pages from the Tome in protective packaging.</p>
    <p>“These are yours. I keep my promises, Embebi,” she speaks, “Do you?” </p>
    <p>Seeing the satchels contents, Embebi’s eyes cannot help but stray toward them.  A soft reverence comes to her expressions, before hardening once more.</p>
    <p>“Irony that you should mention severe mistakes.  It seems a continual motif to my life as of late.  Hard truth is, though, that we Aggro know that mistakes happen… and vow always to avoid repeating them.</p>
    <p>The promise I made in ignorance, I have kept… well enough.  Your secrecy is preserved.  And so, it seems a curious decision on <i>your</i> part to threaten your own half of the bargain by prowling in such a fashion.  Runs counter to the intuition, quiaff?”</p>
    <p>“Bargaining and promises are one thing. Trust is another. I trust my senses. Nothing else.”</p>
    <p>She gently sets the bag down, “I meant what I said. You told me that the only chance for any kind of peace between our people was for me to give you these, with no barter attempted. I presented that argument to my liege and convinced him to allow me to bring you this. I went quite a ways to get it. I still wish for cooperation, Embebi. Why do you not wish the same?” </p>
    <p>Embebi clenches her teeth.  This time, she cannot keep the venom from her lips.</p>
    <p>“You <i>know</i> why.”</p>
    <p>She finally releases her grip on her bow, allowing it and the useless arrow to tumble to the rocks.  Her hands clench and unclench, but are now free to gesticulate, to put motion to her feeling.</p>
    <p>“Know this, and know it well, and know it true.  There was no lie to my mouth when I told you that your only path for peace was to relinquish what you held, back then.  And I meant that. That, and no further.  Peace.  Not ‘cooperation’.  Not ‘understanding’.  <i>Peace.</i>  As in ‘we aren’t killing eachother just yet.’</p>
    <p>You spoke a persuasive story.  I’ll give your tongue that much.  For a time, I even believed it.  But what I saw- what I now see- well, that exposes more the truth of it, quiaff?”</p>
    <p>“And what <i>do</i> you see, Embebi? Don’t hold back. I’m not some petulant child who will lash out at being insulted. Come, tell me what you think.”</p>
    <p>For a moment, Embebi looks uncertain.  Though full of spite, hatred coursing through her, the immensity of what she now faces gives pause to these feelings.  But before long, she recovers.  This time, her mind is made up.  This time, <i>cowardice</i> will not keep her from doing as she should have done before.</p>
    <p>“You want me to put words to it?  Very well.  I’ll satisfy your request.</p>
    <p>I see one who bears a gift, but hides a blade behind it.</p>
    <p>I see one who speaks understanding, but whose true desire is domination.</p>
    <p>I see one who covets power, the means of power, and the knowledge of power so dearly, that they have lost sight of what end that power should be put to, making it its own end.</p>
    <p>I see the hunger you bring with you, that you’d crave potence so that you would even adopt the blood of madness to make yourself strong.</p>
    <p>I see the <span class="animal">Animal</span> in you.  It pains me that the first time found me so inattentive.”</p>
    <p>She rests into a relaxed stance.  Her anger has been spent through her words.  Now, her body prepares for the consequence, her stance low, her posture coiled.  She is ready to die. </p>
    <p>Vesnia folds her arms with a slight <i>hmph</i> sound.</p>
    <p>"I admit, I was rather more expecting a crack about the ears."</p>
    <p>“Oh, I’ll give you a crack about the ears if that’s what you desire.  I’ve made my terms bare.  Bid’s to you now.”</p>
    <p>Vesnia snorts, "I walked into that amush. That's the damndest thing of it all, Embebi. Whether or not you think I'm a snake in the grass… or whatever that translates to in mountains, loose scree?"</p>
    <p>“Snake in the crack.  We get them up here, too.”</p>
    <p>"Typical. Whether or not you believe me, I actually <i>like</i> you, Embebi. I do admire the Crag. I was not trying to manipulate you. Which is why I am <i>desperately</i> trying to prevent you from making a mistake. My orders are clear. I think it rather obvious that we know where Eschaton is now, hm? For the moment, that location is known only to myself and a handful of superiors. If, however, you break your end of our deal, or if the Crag tell the other lowlanders about us… or if I stop reporting, for that matter… every lowlander between here and the western sea will know where every single pebble and stone in Eschaton rests, and you must believe me when I tell you <i>I do not want that to happen.</i>" </p>
    <p>Prepared as she was, a threat of that magnitude causes the blood to drain from her face.  It is one thing to face her own death.  It is quite another to imagine the future Vesnia has promised.</p>
    <p>She does not abandon her stance, but her expression is dark.  She wishes to do the right thing, the correct thing… but she cannot reconcile the two truths of Righteous Action, and the Death of Eschaton.</p>
    <p>“...Fine,” she finally replies.  “I’ll take the bait.  What mistake am I making, you who claims in the same breath that you wish to be my friend, and will sunder apart all that I know?”</p>
    <p>"You are the one trying your damndest to make us enemies, Embebi. I know it might seem odd given what I just said, but that will only happen if <i>you</i> bring it to pass. I am the one trying to keep us from being forced to violence and conflict, and <i>you</i> are the one dead set on dragging us both down that path. I came here to give you everything that is within my power to give you, and you reply by nearly declaring war on me. For the life of me I cannot determine <i>why.</i>" </p>
    <p>“...I ask you my mistake, and you blame <i>me</i> for this situation?  <i>You</i> are the one who came unbidden!  How can you not understand?  What is it that eludes you?  You say that you admire us, know of us, and yet do you know <i>nothing</i> of what we have endured?”</p>
    <p>She exhales heavily.  Her stance does not waver, but it clear her concentration on it is broken; it is all muscle memory now.</p>
    <p>“...I am not the one who is trying to make this a war, Vesnia, blood of Andsko.  The fault likely lies deep in that blood which you lay claim to.  Do you wish me to ignore it?  Do you think all the Crag will be forever fooled by a helmet?  I am not attempting to ignite this feud.  <i>It already exists.</i>  It has defined us for an entire <i>Generation.</I>  Or do you wish to claim that it is merely coincidence that lies in the name you proudly claim, in the traits that you bear? Some <i>other</i> wolf, perhaps?”</p>
    <p>Vesnia pauses, giving Embebi a curious look. She lets the Crag's furious words echo for a few moments before replying, "Embebi… I believe I genuinely do not understand what you mean."</p>
    <p>And with those few words, what little remaining patience Embebi had is sundered… but her response surprises even herself.  It is unplanned, wild, born of disbelief and maddening sorrow.</p>
    <p>“Don’t understand? <i>Don’t understand? <b>How can you not understand?</b></i>”</p>
    <p>Her stance totally abandoned in a fury, she stamps her feet… and a look of crazed determination sweeps over her.  She advances quickly toward Vesnia, not running, but mind intent, insane action clear.</p>
    <p>“You wish me to buy this claim?  To believe that you have no knowledge of what I speak?! <i>FINE!</i>” </p>
    <p>Stopping just short of Vesnia, Embebi thrusts her bare arm in front of her face.</p>
    <p>“BITE ME!”</p>
    <p>Vesnia hesitates.</p>
    <p>"I <i>definitely</i> don't understand what-"</p>
    <p>“BITE ME, DAMN YOU! SHOW ME NO HESITATION, NO FEAR IN YOUR DISGUSTING EYES! <i>DO ITTTTT</i>”</p>
    <p>"<i>I don't know what happened here!</i>" Vesnia shouts back, "The Lycans never told us! They simply told us it was another front in the war!" </p>
    <p>Embebi glares over her exposed arm, wild, maddened eyes looming close over it.  Her entire body tenses; denied fight, and denied flight, it writhes with trapped energy.</p>
    <p>“<i>Enough Talk, Enough Claims!  Now is the Trial! Shut up, and <b>Bite Me</b>, or I swear by all the ancestors before the war you claim will be my fault WILL BE! I will use every tool and word at my disposal to bring what you fear, unless you show me that there is more than</i><span class="animal"> Animal </span><i>in your veins!</i>”</p>
    <p>At the yelling, the two guards start trotting down the hill with weapons lowered. Vesnia holds up a hand, signaling them to stop. She looks at Embebi with clenched teeth.</p>
    <p>".... fucking <i>fine!</i>"</p>
    <p>Vesnia grabs Embebi's wrist and bites down on her forearm in a violent and awkward motion. The frenzy in Embebi’s eyes is gone in an instant, replaced by an almost… creepy serenity. Staring off into the horizon, she slowly withdraws her arm. And then, in spite of everything, that wry smile worms its way back onto her face.</p>
    <p>“...Bargained well, and done.  Heh.  Maybe.  I guess we’ll see in a month’s time, quiaff?”</p>
    <p>She spares a glance at the wound, bitemarks still standing out on her gray flesh.</p>
    <p>“Hoo.  Hokay.  We can talk, now.  No reason not to, quiaff?” </p>
    <p>Vesnia gives her a baffled look, "You… thought I was some kind of afflicted?" </p>
    <p>Embebi shrugs, casually.  “No way of knowing.  Can’t trust your word, I barely know you.  Couldn’t fight, couldn’t run.  So, I fell on the only thing I could trust; your action.  ...And I guess we’ll see how that develops, one way, or another.  But <span class="animal">Animals</span>… no idea why, but they don’t bite if it can be helped.  Unless they bite first, unless it can be helped.  Didn’t do the latter, so check for the former.  Simple recon.”</p>
    <p>"Huh." Vesnia shrugs her shoulders and signals the other riders to return to their positions.</p>
    <p>"Well bargained indeed. You mean you genuinely don't know why they wouldn't bite?" </p>
    <p>Flesh paleing as the adrenaline drains from her system, Embebi finds a convenient surface to lean against.  Her stance is overly flippant.  “How should I have known?  Best I figured, probably so they wouldn’t have as much competition come supper. ”</p>
    <p>Vesnia gives her a surprised look, "They considered the afflicted version of their curse… that is, the type spread by the bite… offensive to their deity. To spread it in such a way was a crime to them. Therefore, if they bit you they had to kill you to ensure the affliction does not spread." </p>
    <p>Embebi Hmms. “Sounds like splitting hairs, to I. Does explain a thing or two, though.  Did notice that some of them were vicious, murderous, an bloodthirsty- and then the others, only part-time.” </p>
    <p>Vesnia gives her a gauging look, "I am beginning to see what I did not understand before. That's practically the first thing they told anyone they actually interacted with. For you not to know that, your conflict with them must have been astoundingly violent, even by their standards." </p>
    <p>Embebi quirks an eye.  “...Didn’t expect to hear that they had a setting other than ‘astoundingly violent’.  Way I knew the fight, it was pretty cut and clear; by the time they had made their way to Eschaton, they had left a path of carnage.  You called it a war before.  We’ve got an entirely different name for it.  ‘<i>The Extermination.</i>’"</p>
    <p>Her gaze trails to the bite, her words becoming hard and cold.  “I’m no scholar.  Even if I was, I’m not sure any left alive know why they came at us like that.  Mostly, just assumed that’s the way they was.  Not so certain of that now, with what I’ve seen left of some of the others down there.  Many of them, I marveled that they still even <i>existed.</i>  They seemed alltogether too… <i>soft.</i></p>
    <p>But times as was, when I first saw the hairs of them, it wasn’t anymore a question of <i>whether</i> or <i>why.</i>  It was only <i>do</i> or <i>die</i>. Personally, I preferred doin’. ”</p>
    <p>"Your assumptions were correct," Vesnia continues the calculating look, "The Lycans took that concept of 'kill what you bite' and applied it to their military doctrine. Once they began a fight in earnest, they saw the only possible outcome as the utter destruction of their enemy. 'Extermination' is an appropriate word. They were capable of pretending to be rational animals, yes. It was possible to work with them, even. But the second a conflict starts? They proved they were animals.</p>
    <p>"I am not an animal, Embebi, and you need not worry about your arm. I am a rational elf." </p>
    <p>Embebi twirls her hand in a non-committal gesture.  “We’ll know the full truth of that in about a month’s time.  Odd, that should feel a comfort.  One route or another, the decision will be made.  Till then, I figure little harm in accepting your words, least so far as chatting goes. </p>
    <p>To speak further of words… you speak of the… ech, crossed my tongue too frequently for my tastes.  Those things.  You too speak of thems and theys.  So, I’m to take it that none of you…”</p>
    <p>“The Lycans are dead and gone. We are elves.” </p>
    <p>Embebi breathes out heavily.  It could even be interpreted as relief.  “Gratifying to hear it… again, if true, but that’s the last I’ll speak of that condition.  As it was, when I heard you gab about that leader, well, after I learned of the…” </p>
    <p>Embebi taps the side of her head, right above her smaller ears.</p>
    <p>“...as I said, I was fretful your leader would just be a big, hairy sort.  Couldn’t get the image out of my mind.”</p>
    <p>Vesnia inclines her head slightly, “Considering our appearance, perhaps not unwise. I can assure-”</p>
    <p>Vesnia’s ear twitches slightly. She turns her head back to look at her guards. They pass her a few quick hand gestures.</p>
    <p>“Hm. It seems your pupils are learning quickly. Unless you want to introduce us, we appear to be low on time.” </p>
    <p>A deep frown sets on Embebi’s face. “No, wouldn’t be wise.  Not yet, anyways.  But…”</p>
    <p>She holds up her arm, bite marks still in plain sight. </p>
    <p>“The token’s thrown, Vesnia.  One month, one way or another.  So let’s make that a fitting arrangement.  One month, and either I return to this spot, ready to listen full… or, I don’t return at all, and… well, you know.”</p>
    <p>Reaching into a small satchel, she fetches a small roll of cloth.  Before applying it, she points towards the page.  A longing look crosses her face, but she shakes it away.</p>
    <p>“For now… let’s call it a sign of some trust- although, in truth, be hard to explain it’s discovery, circumstances given.  Take it.  Bring it in said month.  Then…”</p>
    <p>She wraps the arm.</p>
    <p>“We can bargain on proper terms.”</p>
    <p>Vesnia nods with sincerity, smile returning, “Considering what you told me about the importance of these when we last met, I understand the gravity of that. I will keep them undamaged, and I will return in one month. You will not turn into… anything inelven. That I promise.” </p>
    <p>For a moment, a look of shock flashes onto Embebi’s face, as though something just occurred to her.  With carefully steady tones, she asks; “...Should I start wearing a hat?”</p>
    <p>Vesnia actually laughs at that, “Not yet. It’s not contagious Embebi. Not-” her ear twitches and she glances back at the scouts.</p>
    <p>“It’s time,” she glances back to Embebi and gives a curt bow, “Unexpected, as always. Until next time.” </p>
    <p>Embebi holds her palm up and open… not really a full on wave, but it’s a start.  “I truly hope there is a next time.”</p>
    <p>“There will be,” and this time it sounds like it might not actually be intended as a threat. At least not completely.</p>
    <p>Without further ceremony, Vesnia hops back onto her wolf. She and the other wolf elves are gone in seconds. </p>
    <p>And not a moment too soon.  Mere seconds later, the first of her potentials crests a nearby outcrop, rest of clade in close tow.  “Stalkact! Sitrep? Targs, Hosact?”</p>
    <p>“Neg”, she intones in reply. “And stand down, keep it civil.  Nothing to get excited about, just a delay.”  She tries to sound confident, but there is still a weary tone to her voice.</p>
    <p>Few of the clade wish to do something as crass as contradict their Stalker Actual, but one keen eyed potentiate is a bit more curious than polite.  “Stalkact, your arm… Are you well?  Do you need assistance?”</p>
    <p>Embebi spins her hand dismissively.  “Neg, nothing to fret.  Just an animal bite.  Caught me by surprise, is all.”</p>
    <p>The largest of the bunch raises her enormous, bushy monobrow at this.  “An animal bite?  What kind of animal would manage to bite you?”</p>
    <p>Embebi looks off into the distance, not trusting her eyes to be as glib as her tongue.  “A bold one.”</p>
