    <h1>A Hunter's Prey</h1>
    <p id="cline">
    ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
    </p>
<p>You are <b>Embebi</b>, and you are on the hunt of your life. Everything that you are, everything that you want rides on this. You are filled with a determination that you have never felt before.</p>
<p>That, of course, is the reason you are currently pursuing ancient willed pathways through a freezing cold narrow mountain ravine packed with snow. In pitch darkness. With only a quartz lamp to guide you. In the harshest winter conditions you've seen in a decade. You have to keep going. They are out there somewhere.</p>
<p>"Stalkact," Gustaf's voice is muffled by the snow even though he's right next to you, "This is getting ridiculous."</p>
<p>You stop and regard the path ahead of you. It is a pitch black maw of icy darkness punctuated by the low groan of a freezing wind. Okay maybe he has a point. You turn back to him. You can barely see even his frost rimmed face in the dark.</p>
<p>"Stalkact, this path was willed many years ago. It has lasted this long. One blizzard won't make it disappear. It will still be here in a season, much less tomorrow. Getting ourselves killed trying to follow it in this mess is headdam, quiaff?"</p>
<p>"... Aff." You huff into the cold wind.</p>
<p>"I am not questioning your determination, but this time dying out here isn't the plan we should go with, quineg?"</p>
<p>"Neg." You grit your teeth and stop moving.</p>
<p>You consider what you were <i>just</i> telling your fellow Stalkers. Slow and steady will solve this, not bold and risky acts of heroism. It'd be pretty stupid to get yourself killed like this after all that.</p>
<p>"Aff ack, Gustaf. Let's turn back. We'll revisit this path when the snow clears. No sense in-"</p>
<p>"&lt;silence&gt;" Gustaf interrupts you with a hissed whisper of batlang, "-possible contact, above us. Listen."</p>
<p>You become as still as stone. You don't hear anything except the wind. Wait.</p>
<p>Muffled by the snow, you hear a distinct sound. One that makes your blood run colder than it already was. Metal on metal.</p>
<p>"&lt;lowanders&gt;" you whisper back, "&lt;unknown if we were seen. Move stealthily, fall back. Avoid contact. Affirmative?&gt;"</p>
<p>"&lt;affirmative&gt;"</p>
<p>You plaster yourself to the wall of the ravine and stuff the light into your tunic. Pitch black darkness envelops the ravine. You hear scrambling noises above you. Like a sound you haven't heard in a long time. Claws on stone. You hazard a glance above you.</p>
<p>You can barely see anything. There are precious few stars in the sky. Silhouetted against that you can see hulking black shapes on the ravine above you. You squint. In the dim light, you see yellow eyes peering back at you. You hear a low, canine growling.</p>
<p>"&lt;neg! <i>Neg!</i> Neg stealth, we're spotted! Fall back to camp full speed!&gt;"</p>
<p>"Aff!" Gustaf barks back.</p>
<p>With practiced motion you pull up your bow. You tuck the quartz light between your fingers, filling the ravine with dim light. Gustaf is already pulling ahead of you. You shove your way through the deep snow, trying to get back into the trough you dug getting here. Maybe if you get to that-</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>In the dim light, you see two heavy shapes drop down into the ravine with the sound of crunching snow. They are between you and the route back to the camp. Your light illuminates the golden yellow eyes. You see the beasts' lupine faces and the murky silhouette of riders on their backs.</p>
<p>"<i>Fuck!</i>" Gustaf barks before switching back to batlang, "&lt;ambush! We are cut off!&gt;"</p>
<p><i>Yeah</i>, you think, </i>I noticed.</i></p>
<p>"&lt;back to back&gt;" you order him, "&lt;don't let them separate us.&gt;"</p>
<p>Not like that'll do you much good.</p>
<p>"... Aff." Gustaf presses his back to yours.</p>
<p>Gustaf hesitates, then speaks in civlang, "It's been fun, stalkeract."</p>
<p>"... aff ack."</p>
<p>He's right.</p>
<p>You're <i>fucked.</i></p>
<p>You wish you could've died somewhere more green.</p>
<p>Two more wolf riders drop into the other side of the ravine. They pad slowly towards you. You nock an arrow and count the pairs of eyes. At least a dozen, between those in the ravine and above it.</p>
<p id="i">Why haven't they just killed us yet?</p>
<p>If those two pairs of riders had charged, you and Gustaf would be smashed gravel by now. Instead, they move silently towards you. They stop just at the edge of your light.</p>
<p>"&lt;orders?&gt;" Gustaf whispers,</p>
<p>"&lt;hold.&gt;"</p>
<p>One of the riders closest to you dismounts. The figure approaches the light. You see a mottled gray cloak lined with fur. It's a lowlander alright, wearing metal armor made from horizontal bands. Over red cloth. It holds a heavy looking metal spear. You try to remember what Saltik had described. An… auxiliary?</p>
<p>The figure enters the light. You can make out a face. It takes you a moment, but you've met many lowlanders at this point. You can't make out her ears, but her features cut her as a lowlander elf. Her eyes reflect yellow, just like the giant wolf she rides. You level your bow at her.</p>
<p>"Greetings, Crag," She speaks in a calm, confident voice, "You should lower that weapon. I wish to parlay with you, and you should accept. It's your only way out of this ravine alive."</p>
<p>Gustaf looks at you expectantly. You decide what to do.</p>
<p>It’s a serious question.  While your first thought is to fight and, probably, die, there’s something… offputting about this whole situation. If they wanted you dead, then that would already be in progress.  If they wanted you captured… well, probably the same thing.  You have no doubts in your abilities as a warrior, but two to a dozen, and in these narrow confines… even an Aggro can do that math.</p>
<p>Time is ticking.  So, rather than think, you suppose it’s just time to act.  Unorthodox, impetuous action put you here.  One way or another, it’ll be responsible for getting you out.</p>
<p>“If you want to talk, talk.  I won’t stop your message.  But if you want my hands empty, you’ll have to start the trend.  If I’m to die here, I’ll be killed, not slaughtered, quiaff?”</p>
<p>She nods slightly, "You hold your weapon with a steady hand, even now. Impressive. I respect your desire to die as a warrior and not a beast, if it comes to that. Very well. I will start with a smaller bid. That's the term the Crag use, yes? Then how about this: You may hold your weapon ready, merely stop pointing it at my <i>face</i>. In return, I won't order my soldiers to cut you down. For now. Do we have a deal?" </p>
<p>You consider thinking about that… and then stop.  There’s no time for thinking here.  What’s the first instinct?</p>
<p>Somewhat to your surprise, it turns out to be… lowering the bow?</p>
<p>Huh.  Okay, roll with it.  Worst case, it’ll add half a second to your draw time.  You’ve counted.</p>
<p>“Close enough.  Bargained well, and done.  And in turn, I’ll commend you for your stealthcraft.  It’s clear you are no stranger to this clime.  Gustaf, ease.”</p>
<p>He hesitates, but follows suit.  Although you are attempting to affect a casual bearing, attempting to match confidence to confidence with your unknown addressee, you can feel the tension he bears. You forgive him.  If you gave yourself the luxury to think on it, you’d doubt yourself, too. </p>
<p>“So.  What’s the Sit?  ...uation, here?”</p>
<p>The elf inclines her head slightly to the riders behind her. There is a slight clink of metal, and you see the glint of speartips. They are raised up, in a ready but not threatening stance. From the cliffs above you, you hear the distinct sound of bowstrings relaxing slowly.</p>
<p>"Improving," she turns back to you, "Let's keep the bids small for the moment. How about a name for a name? Who are you?" </p>
<p>Improving, indeed.  Lets see if you can’t keep this up.</p>
<p>“Name’s Embebi.  Didn’t know that would be bid, already gave away his.  Whoops.” </p>
<p>You shrug.  Hopefully, it looks nonchalant.</p>
<p>She shrugs back, "Simply trying to stay civil. My name is Vesnia Andskoti. You are… an aggro, yes? A stalker?" </p>
<p>“On target, both times.  Not bad.  You must have been listening in for a whi-”</p>
<p>Something, that nagging sensation that you had been largely ignoring as it would force you to think too much, finally pushes its way to the fore.  This is a Lowlander.   </p>
<p>Or, well, really, maybe not?  They’re up here too.  Wouldn’t that make them a Highlan-FOCUS.</p>
<p>They know too much.</p>
<p>“...We aren’t the first Crag you found, quineg?”</p>
<p>She smiles. It's not a reassuring expression. "You're the first Crag I've spoken to. I see your concern, and I can reassure you. You would like to know why I know a few things about you. That is not a difficult question to answer. Allow me."</p>
<p>She reaches into her cloak and removes something. It is a small glass square, framed with wood. She takes a step towards you and holds it up towards the light. Even from where you stand, it's obvious what it is. A page from the Tome, encased in a protective frame. She continues smiling.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you'd like to move to larger bids?" </p>
<p>Your expression hardens.  A series of conflicting thoughts rush through your mind… not the least of which may be whether the rumors about Lowlander telepathy may have some merit.  However, one thing is clear.  This is no time for your particular brand of coy levity.  </p>
<p>If you move now, you might be able to slay her.  Recover the precious page.  But it is still a serious doubt that you could return it to your people alive.  Though it rankles you to have to enter into a bid like this with nothing but your life on your side, you see little other option.</p>
<p>May as well be honest.</p>
<p>“You play a dangerous game, showing that.  You seem quite knowledgeable.  You would know that we would not be alone.  What you may not have accounted for in your stakes is that those who attend us share our Stalker skill.  Even if we should fall, here and now, it would only prolong the time until they find you once more.</p>
<p>What you hold in your hand is more dangerous to you than an enraged viper.  It can bring you no bounty, no profit.  It would be in your best interest to return it to me.  Then, I may be able to speak on your behalf.</p>
<p>So, with all hands revealed; what is your bid?”</p>
<p>Her smile widens, "Such bravado, even when outnumbered six to one. I like you, Embebi. You should, however, stop and think a little before speaking like that. Why do you think I brought this all the way up here? Light fireside reading? No, Embebi, I brought this all the way up here because I want to return it to you. Of course, for a price."</p>
<p>She lowers the page slightly, "There are more where this came from, and I am willing to bid that as well. You see, my liege has read some of the works of your ancestors. He finds it quite inspiring. My liege would like to know more of the Crag and the wisdom of their ancestors. In return, he would like to reunite you with some of the wisdom you have lost. What say you, Embebi?" </p>
<p>Your mouth is dry.  You can feel your blood begin to sing.  You tamp it down, hard.  </p>
<p>Her smile tells you what you need to know.  Her words confirmed it.  She heard, but did not understand.  With the stakes as they are, there is no room for foolish miscommunication.</p>
<p>Repeating yourself is demeaning.  Even dangerous.  It may cost you your life; you get the feeling that this is someone who is… unaccustomed to hearing neg.  </p>
<p>An image flashes before you.  Saltik’s arm.  The stomach turning ruin it was.</p>
<p>The Aggro need no more of that.  Not this soon.  Not if it can be helped.</p>
<p>“I hear you, Vesnia, of the… something… Bloodname of Andsko.  But you did not hear me.  I am unaccustomed to your way of speaking.  So I will try again.</p>
<p>What I told you was not bravado.  Not braggadocio. It was a warning.  You may think that what you hold is a valuable bargaining chip.  A precious bauble.  A coveted relic.  It is nothing so crude.</p>
<p>What you hold is our future.</p>
<p>You may think to threaten us by withholding it.  You may even think to destroy it.  In doing so, you would destroy yourselves.  Whoever you are, whoever your liege is, you must, I implore you, MUST understand.  To recover those works… even if it meant the destruction of us both… we would pursue you and yours to the end of this world, and beyond.  Not for pride.  Not for greed.  For Future.</p>
<p>I can bid no further, make no promise, until I know that you <i>ken</i>.  There can be no negotiation here that ends with you retaining those works, withholding them for a ransom.  There can only be one outcome that will prevent untold quantities of death, without end, until only one remains.  That outcome is for you to hand me that page, promise me the others… and then I, Embebi, the strange, ineffable soul that I am, will speak fondly of your desire for… whatever it is you truly desire.  I will speak of how just it would be, to return it for such a good turn done.  How I gave my word that it would be so.</p>
<p>Please understand.  For all our sakes.” </p>
<p>As you speak, the smile vanishes from her face. When you finish, she speaks quietly. Barely loud enough to be heard over the wind.</p>
<p>"I never intended to destroy it, Embebi. As you are unaccustomed to speaking to one such as me, I am unaccustomed to speaking to one such as you. Given what I have heard of the Crag, I came here expecting a hostile dealing. A competitive bid. Clearly, I was wrong. It is a good thing we are rational elves who may speak and learn of each other, and not animals who will go for the throat at the first sign of disagreement."</p>
<p>She holds up the page, "This page is yours. I can grant that. I can also explain my position further. I did not come here hoping to bid like a merchant seeking advantage. I came here to <i>learn</i> from the Crag, and hopefully allow you to learn from us. I… can't speak directly for my liege. However, if I can convince him that we can… <i>ken</i> as well, he will certainly agree to the rest. Ken… that means some form of trust, yes?"</p>
<p>She holds the page towards you with one hand. She gestures at her mounted soldiers with another. They step back. </p>
<p>Your blood quiets.  Tension leaves your jaw.  You think you may have even audibly sighed as you relaxed.  It’s unseemly, but who cares?  It’s just Gustaf here.</p>
<p>You reach out, slowly but certainly, and grasp the precious page.  </p>
<p>Funny.  You thought… imagined, more… that it would, you don’t know, tingle, or something.  But it is just a bit weighty.  </p>
<p>Before you pull it from her grasp, you look at Vesnia… actually looking at her, not her posture, her weapons, the tension in her limbs, but her, as a person.</p>
<p>“Thank you for this gift.  These are odd times, Vesnia.  Before, a request by an outsider, to even learn <i>of</i> the Crag, let alone <i>from</i> them?  It would be an unthinkable quandry.  A joke.  But I will entreat your request with all the deadly seriousness it deserves.  Make no mistake; this <i>was</i> a hostile dealing.  But any Aggro can tell you; hostile dealings do not require wasteful bloodshed.</p>
<p>What you request, I will fulfill.”</p>
<p>The whisper of a gasp.  You can feel Gustaf tense.</p>
<p>“<i>I</i> will fulfill.  I can make no promises for others.  I do not have that authority.  But for the gift you have given… the further gifts that you promise… I am more than willing to make this sacrifice.  Moments ago, I was ready to give my life.  I still am, even if it holds different context.”</p>
<p>You pull the page from her grasp.</p>
<p>“Bargained well, and Done.  What would you ask of me?”</p>
<p>She lets the page go. No resistance, no trickery. She returns her hand to her side.</p>
<p>“Secrecy,” She answers simply, “As with you, there are many that do not understand us. Those that if they learned the truth about us, would seek to destroy us. In that, we have a shared cause. All I ask is that you keep our existence as secret as you keep your own. Is that acceptable?” </p>
<p>“More than, and then some.  However, I cannot promise it will do you much good.  Curiously, these mountains seem to be crawling with outsiders.”</p>
<p>Darn.  Seems you can’t help yourself.  Come on, be serious.</p>
<p>“Beyond myself, and Gustaf, only one more soul will know of our encounter.  I can state that they, as well, value privacy.  They will see the merit in your request, for the bounty it provides.  What else?” </p>
<p>She nods, “I see the honesty in your words, and appreciate it. No one can promise perfect secrecy, and if they can they are a fool. You have promised as much secrecy as you can offer, and that will more than suffice.”</p>
<p>She takes a deep breath, “I would like to explain who I am… who <i>we</i> are slightly better. I understand that before, I may have made it sound as if my liege is some dithering noble who reads the Tome as if it were a trashy romance novel. This is not the case. It is not a mere interest, curiosity, or hobby to him. He has read the samples he has found with great passion. He has heard the ways of your ancestors, and taken them to heart. The selection of traits, the creation of generations, and of bloodlines. Of discovering the true strength that elves are capable of, beyond that of any other mortals. He… <i>we</i> have been attempting to achieve that perfection, in our own way. Our tools, however, are limited. As are yours, as were your ancestors. What we hope is that by combining the traits that we have you available to us, we may together pursue the perfection that we know is attainable. You see, Embebi…”</p>
<p>She raises her hands and drops back her hood. Her skin is dark gray, with tufts of fur running along her cheeks and up to her ears. Her ears themselves are long, tufted and tipped with fur much like that of a wolf.</p>
<p>“I am a wolf elf, and we have a similar philosophy to yours.” </p>
<p>Your stomach turns on you.  Deep in that buried part of your mind that you are <i>still</i> actively ignoring (to mixed success), you had suspected that there might be something to the wolf theme you had been noticing.</p>
<p>What this is is… perverse.  Appalling.  In truth, it helps you recognize just how perverse you, yourself are that it does not immediately set you to bloodshed.  But there is one nagging question that stays your hand.  Ancestors preserve you, your curiosity has always gotten the better of you.</p>
<p>“...Your master.  Your liege.  Is he a… wolf-elf, like you?”</p>
<p>She frowns, "I was worried you would react like this. Consider it an exchange of honesty that I revealed my identity when I could have kept it hidden, and think carefully about what it is the Crag seek. Yes. He is." </p>
<p>This time, you manage to control your visible signs of relaxation.  So, at least the pages were not <i>utterly</i> defiled.  Just… kinda.  Eugh.</p>
<p>“...I see.  Very well.  I cannot hide how your form appears to me.  But you spoke in truths, earlier.  I will weigh your actions against what I see.  But I will give you one final parting truth.  There are very few among our kind who would react as… favorably… as I have.  Your secrecy would be well advised.”</p>
<p>You can feel yourself struggling to get words out.  Your mind is clashing against itself.  Your duty versus your instinct.  Your responsibility versus desire.</p>
<p>"I understand this, Embebi," She nods, "And why my appearance may revile you. It is my sincere hope that one day, you will understand us. That all the Crag may understand us. For now, tolerance is far more than I was expecting to receive. I will return to my liege immediately. I will tell him of our encounter, and of what you said. I am certain he will allow me to return the pages we have to you when he learns how favorable our discussion was. You show wisdom, Embebi." </p>
<p>You use all the willpower at your disposal to try to keep your face from curling in disgust.  You don’t know if you succeed.  Wisdom?</p>
<p>“I will leave as well.  No more productive talk can be had this day.  Night.  Whichever.”</p>
<p>She nods and gestures. The two wolf riders blocking you from returning to camp part.</p>
<p>Vesnia pauses, considering her words.</p>
<p>She simply says, "Goodbye, Embebi. Until we meet again." </p>
<p>You say nothing in return.  You do not trust yourself to.  You just go.  It takes a moments tug to make sure Gustaf is going with you.</p>
<p>You are a maelstrom of thought, feeling, and bitter, nauseating knowledge.  As you allow your conscious thoughts to return to the surface, every replayed moment of the encounter only serves to further divide you.  Your feet know how to tread the way home.  Your mind is busy elsewhere.</p>
<p>After what seems like an eternity, you finally find words to speak.</p>
<p>“Gustaf-”</p>
<p>“<i>Neg.</i> Neg neg neg and nullchat.  Opsec.”</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“<i>Opsec.</i> I witnessed nothing.  I have no recollection.  Whatever weighty quandary you were about to share with me, I can bear no part of it.  I was not there. Opsec.”</p>
<p>You exhale.  He’s right, of course.  You have no right to share this burden with him.  If it were a lesser matter, perhaps.  But what you did, what you said… you must bear it alone.  That was the sacrifice you were willing to make.  You must bear the consequences.</p>
<p>You survived.  You lived to carry this knowledge.  To be able to act on it.  To be able to prepare for it.</p>
<p>There is no small part of you that wishes you had let instinct rule.  The dead suffer no such dilemmas.</p>
<p>You had promised that but one more soul would learn of this encounter.  At the time, you know who that soul would have been.  Now, knowing what you know… you are uncertain.  For which soul you inform could decide the fate of all Crag.</p>
<p>...When you get home, you’re punching Saltik right in his enormous face.  <i>Stupid fucking quest.</i></p>
