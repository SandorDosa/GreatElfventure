<h1>A Rocky Shore</h1>
<p>Itâ€™s late summer when Partager reaches the river banks where they have agreed to trade with their Crag. They begin
    the complicated task of delivering their shipment of sturdy lumber in exchange for numerous pails of precious and
    semiprecious gemstones. Over the past several weeks of float time, Cel and Boots have been introduced to most of the
    flotilla. They are, by now, clearly used to her presence among them.</p>
