    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <h2>Esteemed Elpahka</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p>Chosen from the earliest days of the First Generation, there are bloodlines who have always been destined to Lead.  Their wisdom is paramount, their judgement unfailing.  Known collectively as the Elpahka, these savants and sages are entrusted with the continuation of their kind, and with the pursuit of perfection which is their very reason for being.  The chief among these, chosen with great care for their purity of soul and adherence to the tenets of The Tome, is the Esteemed, a title which grants them Supreme Executive Power. They wield this power for life, guiding many generations of Crag Elves further along the Path… at least, they did, before the Path was Lost.  </p>
    <p> In these troubled times, <b>Ledret Blakenova</b> is the current Esteemed, and has been for the last three centuries.  Even in her advanced age, she remains as wise and shrewd as ever; no corruption threatens her spirit, no ailment plagues her mind.  However, it cannot be denied that she is deep within the grips of infirmity.  Her body, even though buoyed by the strength of stone within Crag Elf hearts, is slowly eroding, plain for all to see.  In accordance with The Tome, by now she should have chosen a successor, one among the Elphaka whom she had groomed to be the next Esteemed, who could be tested and tried by all who would become their peers.  However, with the terrible trial that was the Lycan War, all who she had considered are lost, and beset on all sides she could not afford to let her concentration lapse long enough to groom others.  And so, the Esteemed Fades, and still no successor is present. </p>
	<p> n truth, she fears that there is insufficient time left to properly groom a successor, and far more damning, the remnants of the Elphaka she has to choose from carry few who are obvious choices for the role: the best and the brightest of the Bloodied Generation were destroyed by madness, all to ensure that the Crag Elves would persist at all.  As such, she sees there as being only one option available; to continue her Guidance for all Crag Elves until her body crumbles to dust, her mind is lost to madness, and her spirit shrivels to nothing.  It is her most fervent wish that before she finally succumbs to time, there will be one among the Elphaka, or even among the other castes, who she can deem worthy of carrying on their long legacy; for, if none be worthy in all that time, how can the dream of perfection still live?</p>

    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Melancholic Ancient Autocrat<br/>
        Desperately seeking one worthy of continuing the journey along the Path of Perfection.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Time Erodes All<br/>
        The health of the Esteemed is failing, year by year, month by month.  None can say how much longer she can retain rule before weakness in body, mind, or soul claims her.  For this reason, though she is the 'highest authority', she is not the most potent of the Crag.

    <h2>Echo of Blood</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p>Chosen from the earliest days of the First Generation, there are bloodlines who have always been destined to Protect.  Their bodies are strong, their hearts unwavering.  Known collectively as the Aggro, these stalwart defenders were impressive specimens, even by Crag elf standards, massive and muscled, true paragons of the physical.  Their physical prowess proved sufficient to handle the internal strife and occasional purges required to keep the Crag Elves to The Path, but mere muscle proved woefully inadequate when faced up against military training and ingenuity.</p>
    <p>The Aggro of the modern day are more experienced, and far less forgiving, than their predecessors, as only those who could rapidly adapt to the harsh realities of war remained.  Few exemplify this better than <b>Saltik Bergenich</b>, known throughout the Crag Elves by his earned epithet, the “Echo of Blood”.  Though once little more than a Guard Sergeant, he earned his title for the countless tales of slaughter he left in his wake.  Witnesses to his deeds attest to his prowess as he tore through Lycan lines, moving with heedless abandon deep into their formations, the only sign left of his passing being the trail of blood, both Lycan and his own.  Time and time again he threw himself into the maw of the Lycan Elite, and time and time again he survived.</p>
    <p>For his legacy of carnage, Saltik has become something entirely new to the Crag Elves; a War Hero.  His popularity among the aggro, and even among the other bloodlines, cannot be understated, for he is a symbol of endurance, of survival, and of vengeance for the Crag Elves.  Saltik is not ignorant of this worship; rather, he embraces it, for he knows that in these times of Uncertain Paths that his kind need assurance, a sign that all will be well, and they are receiving precious little of that from what remains of the Elphaka.  Besides, why shouldn’t he be adored?  His accolades were not given to him by tradition or station, but by the bloody deeds he achieved, a saga of slaughter etched into the living stones.  He earned their admiration, and should fate be willing, he will continue to earn it: By whatever means, with whatever strength he has, he will ensure the prosperity of the Crag Elves.</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b>  Sanguine, Statuesque Warrior<br/>
        Saltik embodies the might of the Crag Elves, actively seeking to improve their lot with his hands-on talents.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Block Headed<br/>
         Though no doubt powerful and skilled, Saltik is nonetheless extremely ignorant in many matters, including those of a military nature.

    <h2>First Among Scholars</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p>Chosen from the earliest days of the First Generation, there are bloodlines who have always been destined to Remember.  Their memories sharp, their attention focused. Known collectively as the Bakshish, they were responsible for one of the most sacred tasks of Crag Elf culture; the meticulous and obsessive documentation of bloodlines, traits, magical abilities, and more within the voluminous pages of The Tome of Physical Perfection, comparing prediction to outcome and making certain that their journey along The Path was proceeding as planned.  In addition to this essential work, they also served as the Crag Elf equivalent of administrators, tax assessors, stockhandlers and other tasks essential to the smooth and uninterrupted operation of a well-oiled society.  However, in the wake of the Lycan war, the Bakshish are bloodlines in mourning; while some may have lost more members, and others more lines, none have lost so much purpose as the Bakshish.  The destruction of The Tome represents an unfathomable loss of knowledge, and it was but one of thousands of carefully kept documents which carried the right and proper instructions for balancing the needs and the goals of Crag Elf society.  </p>
	<p>Though despair over what has been lost may be crippling for some Bakshish, for others, it has motivated them into furious, manic action.  <b>Renyan Elematich</b>, a young Crag Elf who was one of the last of the Bloodied Generation to be born, has risen among his peers to be recognized as the First Among Scholars, a largely ceremonial title, but one that is still rarely given to a Crag Elf so young as he.  However, it cannot be denied that the title is deserved, for his rage against the despondency and depression that now runs through the Bakshish has motivated him to recover and recreate numerous vital pieces of lore.  Through this flurry of activity, basic foodstocks were replenished, coffers were filled with vital ingots of iron, copper, and tin, and the normal, productive pace of life resumed.  This is only the beginning, however.  There is so much more to do, so many industries to rekindle, such incredible knowledge to recover, or even uncover.  Someone’s gotta do it, and if no one is up to the task, then by the Ancestors he’ll do it himself.</p>

    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b>  Choleric Scholaric<br/>
        Renyan's temper drives him to rebuild all lost lore and administration of his broken people.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Heart as Hard as Stone<br/>
        Renyan’s opinions of his fellow Bakshish, and indeed all his Crag Elf kin, were badly poisoned by their idle, useless mourning following the end of the Lycan War.  As a result, he sees little point in propriety, manners, or even in seeking aid; if something has to be done right, then he has to do it himself.

    <h2>Layer of The Path</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p>Chosen from the earliest days of the First Generation, there are bloodlines who have always been destined to Shape.  Their hands skillful, their craft unmatched.  Known collectively as the Onagi, they are the masons, the smiths, the cooks and the artists of the Crag Elves, responsible for the elegant stone homes which they populate, the efficient iron weapons they wield, and the nutritious meals they consume.  Together with the Samra, the bloodlines which Toil, they form the backbone of Crag Elf industry; a backbone which was almost broken.  Carrying the greatest variety of Bloodlines, each dedicating themselves to the mastery of a necessary task, the losses that the Onagi faced as bloodline after bloodline was lost in the war against the Lycans were sobering.  Even now, ten years later, the Onagi struggle to cover all the duties left open; bloodlines once dedicated to a single mastery find themselfs mastering three, four, or more to cover all essential tasks.  Still, in spite of these pressures, they are recovering with commendable speed.</p>
	<p>No finer example is there of the modern polymaster Onagi than <b>Slabal Nanockova</b>, Mason, Smith, Architect, Sculptor, and Urban Developer. It is this last skillset which has earned her her illustrious title, coveted among all the Onagi: The Layer of The Path holds a position which holds deep civic and spiritual significance, responsible for the design and development of all Crag Elf communes to ensure expedient, efficient transition of resources, information, and personnel.  Yet, in spite of all of these masteries and achievements, Slabal endlessly devotes her time to mastering more forms of art and artifice, putting herself where the work is needed.  While some may praise her diligence, Slabal herself is all too aware of the truth; such constant labor is the least that is required if the Crag Elves hope to survive.  Many are eager to ignore it, but her people are in dire straights; unsteady leadership, barely recovering industry, a populace that is losing faith in their most fundamental principles.  To do any less than the very utmost that is possible is naught but folly, and it falls on the shoulders of those like her who recognize the danger to ensure their survival.  For, were the many weaknesses she knows of to be public knowledge, The Path would surely be lost forever beneath a storm of calamity and panic.</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Phlegmatic Renaissance Elf<br/>
        Slabal will exert every ounce of strength left in her to see to it that her people survive a fall more dramatic than they realize.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Focused to a Fault<br/>
        Slabal’s dedication to her people’s wellbeing has been taken to unhealthy extremes; whenever possible, she ignores all the demands of her body in order to attend to the needs of the people.  Though as sturdy as any Crag Elf, her body and mind may make her crack if sufficient pressure is applied.

    <h2>Stalker Actual</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Not as great an honorary title as others, the Stalker is a position granted to those Aggro who seem to have keen insight into the arts of moving unseen and treading unheard… a non-trivial task for such a large and bulky people.  Typically, their skills in the crafts of blending and camouflage grants them the dubious distinction of leading the longest and most dangerous of patrols outside of the walls of Eschaton… a distinction that has become all the more dubious in recent times, now that said patrols have been makeshifted into actual pathfinding.</p>
    <p>Still, for the task, you could ask for few keener than <b>Embebi</b> for the challenge.  During the Extermination, she showed an unusually keen insight in the the Lowlands, becoming not only skilled, but also fascinated by all of the greens, browns, and vegetation that the Lowland came to offer.  Some of the Aggro are a bit put off at how, in later years, this fascination has turned obsession, but with the recent revelations, it appears that she may have opportunities to indulge her interests.
</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Easygoing Wildwoman<br/>
        Embebi is much more keen and comfortable in the untamed wilds of the lowlands than in the rigid structure of Eschaton.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Loam Ranger<br/>
        Embebi’s obsession with the unusual and exotic nature of the lowlands is a frequent distraction; while perhaps the single most knowledgeable(in practical terms at least) of Crag about the nature of the Lowlands, she has a bad tendency to let her obsession get the better of her in the field.
