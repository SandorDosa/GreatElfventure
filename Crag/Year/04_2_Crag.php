<p>  </p> 
<p>A chill wind chases you into your office/living quarters, the nearly-freezing zephyr managing to insinuate itself within its confines before you slam the door on it.  Sheets of paper and vellum rustle from it’s temporary presence, and the sound of it is nothing short of music to your ears.  Perhaps if you had been allowed to go directly here upon your return, you would have been able to escape the bitter cold that has fallen upon Eschaton as the sun sets below you, but <i>of course</i> you had to be the very first to be <i>interrogated</i> upon your return by The Esteemed.  While, you admit, her questions were mercifully short and, for once, lacked any probing queries designed to call into question your intentions, character, and <i>morals…</i> that didn’t mean that the conversation was any less taxing than it normally was when forced to put things into terms <i>appropriate</i> for one so <i>ignorant.</i></p>

<p>...Okay, you may be a bit cranky.  Who wouldn’t be?</p>

<p>You are weary.  You are aching.  You are <b>The First</b>, and <i>fuck you</i> it is good to be home.  You take just a moment to appreciate how wonderful the sensation of <i>normalcy</i> is.  You cast your gaze around your room, taking in the parchments and notes, the diagrams and equipment, each exactly where you left it, each a monument to the sheer drive and efficiency with which you approach every problem laid before you.  Even though it has been <i>months</i> you’ve spent in the Lowlands, being dragged hither and yon(you’re pretty sure it was just a yon, not a yonder, but you can’t claim to have been keeping perfect track) across all manner of terrain both intriguing and despicable, you can still recall <i>precisely</i> where you were in your reclusive research into the dire future of the Crag… research that, surprisingly, did not languish, but rather, flourished from your prolonged traipsing!</p>

<p>Okay, enough waxing poetic.  While your body clamors for rest, and your mind clamors for ‘relaxation’, your <i>pride</i> recognizes that there’s still a small amount of time available before fatigue utterly claims you… perhaps, just enough time to properly catalogue your findings from this recent expedition.  While it is, of course, all safely inscribed in your travelling journal, one can never have too many copies of vital information.  Your body works on instinct, seeking out everything you require; writing stand, blank vellum, ink pot, feather…</p>

<p>Hrm.  That reminds you.  <i>The Feather.</i>  Of course, you left it safely locked in your desk while you were away… no sense in risking the loss of such a <i>valuable</i> tool on the march… so perhaps you should check it before you begin?  For reasons you cannot fully comprehend, the Lowlanders seem rather keen on broadcasting their every achievement upon it… </p>

<p>Fetching the key from your pouch, you sidle over to your desk, unlock the drawer, reach in and grab-</p>
<p>...Hrm.  Reach in and grab…</p>
<p>Your hand slides along the bottom of the drawer, feeling every corner, but you cannot lay hands upon the feather.  Frustrated, you grab a glowstone, and hold it into the drawer… only to find it completely barren.</p>

<p>Your mind comes to a screeching halt.  There could be no doubt.  The Feather was <i>gone.</i></p>
<p>In and of itself, that was a punishing blow to your research… although you had planned on perhaps finding a new informant, in light of recent events… but there was a deeper matter to be concerned with here.  </p>
<p><i>Treachery.</i> </p>
<p id="First"><i>“Fuck.”</i></p>
<p>The absence of the feather is conclusive evidence of <i>Larceny</i>.  Someone… you have a couple suspicions of who!... must have found out about it, and in your absence, <i>absconded</i> with it, and has been communicating with ancestors-only-know-who about not-even-ancestors-even-know-<i>what</i>.  Your mind boggles at the possibilities! </p>
<p>It could be some ambitious Aggro, planning their conquest of the Lowlands in Echo’s absence!  </p>
<p>Calamity!</p>
<p>Worse, it could be another Bakshish, attempting to tap into the same rich vein of knowledge you have! Usurpation!</p>
<p>Or, worst of all, considering what you’ve just learned of in the Lowlands, it could be a <i>spy!</i></p>
<p><i>Unthinka-</i></p>

<p>Your thinking of the unthinkable is shattered by a knock at your door.  Shifting thoughts without a clutch, your mind gets caught between unspeakable treachery and unbidden visitors, and for a brief moment you find yourself certain that whoever is knocking is here to cover up their larceny by <i>removing the only other person who knows there’s been a larceny.</i></p>

<p>Acting on instinct, you throw the glowstone into the drawer, slam it shut, and leap under your desk, taking inventory of what formulae you have on hand to thwart a would-be assailant.  As it turns out, that’s not much;  you drank most of it already.</p>

<p>The door creaks open, slowly.  <i>They’re making their move.</i>  Your hand goes to the lith, secreted away in your robes.  With any luck, they’ll get close enough that you can…</p>

<p id="Drivel">“...Uh… First Among Scholars?  Are you there?  I thought I saw him return…”</p>

<p>Wait! You know that voice!  The Assassin!  It’s <i>Driv-</i></p>
<p>Drivel.</p>
<p>...An assassin.</p>

<p>The incongruity of those two thoughts colliding together causes a destructive harmony in your brain, wiping the slate clean.  </p>
<p>Oh, 3rd hell.  You’re crouched under a desk, wild eyed, sweating profusely, knife in hand,  waiting to stab your trusted(?) assistant on suspicion of a murder plot.</p>

<p>You really <i>have</i> become Sivens.</p>

<p>Well, time to switch to Damage Control mode.  No sudden movements now.  Slowly, <i>casually</i>, you crawl out from under your desk, unfortunately finding that, yes, Drivel is already looking inside.  As you rise above the lip, his eyes fix on you, uncertainty playing across his face.  </p>
<p>No problem.  No worries.  This is normal.  Highly elevated scholars crouch under their desks all the time, for all manner of reason.  For example…</p>
<p id="First">“Ah! Drivel! Good to see you!  I was just… I just dropped something!  Under my desk!  Nothing to worry about!”</p>
<p><i>Shit,</i> you overcorrected.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“...Um… Worry?”</p>
<p><i>Shit,</i> he noticed.</p>
<p id="First">“Ah… yes.  Don’t want you to worry, even though I…”</p>
<p>Nothing else is coming to you.  Fuck it.  Go for broke.</p>
<p id="First">“...I am holding this lith, you see.”  </p>
<p>You raise your hand, holding the lith, tapping it on your desk top.  His eyes go wide.</p>
<p id="First">“Ah… as I said, nothing to worry about! I just use this for… cutting vellum into strips! Very handy, lets me create little <i>notes</i> you see… but, well, knowing your, ah, <i>delicate</i> temperament, I thought you might worry.  So I told you not to.”</p>
<p>He’s definitely worrying.  And probably, not just about the Lith.  Time to take control here.</p>
<p id="First">“Although I’m disappointed to see that you still seem to be worrying anyway!  Have some backbone, Crag!  Now <i>get in here</i>, you’re letting in a draft!”</p>
<p>That finally spurs him to motion.  Stepping into your dark room, he feels his way around, finding the seat in front of your desk.  He sits there in silence a moment as you scramble to get ahold of the situation.</p>
<p id="First">“So!  What brings you here?”</p>
<p>To allay any suspicions, you immediately begin putting truth to your claim, grabbing the fresh sheet of vellum you had just grabbed, and start cutting it into strips.  Unfortunately, your lith is a bit dull, it seems… you’ve really got to saw at it to get through the thin material.</p>
<p>Drivel’s eyes continually wander towards the lith.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“...Err… you… asked me to come see you.  As soon as you got back.  In your letter.”</p>
<p>Your letter?  <i>Oh right,</i> your letter!  <i>Oh right,</i> the New Research!  <i>Right!</i></p>
<p>Finally back on solid footing, you put the lith and shredded vellum to the side, causing Drivel to visibly relax.  Heh.  We’ll see how long <i>that</i> lasts.</p>
<p id="First">“Ah, yes, the Letter!  And your new assignment!  <i>Very</i> exciting things happening there!”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Uhm… yes.  About the previous assignment…”</p>
<p>You wave your hand dismissively. </p>
<p id="First">“No need to fret about that one, Drivel.  I know full well what a handful those Heads can be!  Don’t worry about it, I’m sure they can take it from here… it’s their problem now, as this New Assignment is one that relies specifically on your skillset!  As I recall, <i>your</i> specialization was in <i>Lowland Esoterica</i>, yes? “</p>
<p>He looks uncertain, but finally replies.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“Err… yes.  That was… I guess still is… the department I’m under.  But, about the previous project, I feel I should tell you…”</p>
<p id="First">“No need for apologies, Drivel!  Don’t worry about the Past.  Instead, there’s new trails to be blazed!  Now, tell me, Drivel… as part of your mastery of various Lowland Esoterica, would one of the parts of that study be in Lowland… <i>religious</i> practices?”</p>
<p>Again, he looks uncertain, but finally, lets out a sigh.  You’d say it’s a sign of relief, but you can’t help but feel that it was tinged with frustration.  Well, you’re no stranger to <i>that</i> when it comes to the Heads of those departments.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“The... religious practices of the Lowlands?  Uhm… Yes, I think that falls under the purview of Esoterica.”</p>
<p>You quirk an eyebrow.  </p>
<p id="First">“You ‘think’ it falls under Esoterica?”</p>
<p> Ah, that focuses his attention nicely.  </p>
<p id="Drivel"> “Err.. Yes! Yes, Lowland Esoterica includes the study of the religious practices and theology of the Lowlands dating back to before the First Generation, Yes.”</p>
<p>You plaster a smile on your face, acting the part of the pleased teacher.  </p>
<p id="First">“Good Crag!  You should be confident in what you know.  Tell me, Drivel… what do you know of the Lowlander <i>gods?</i>”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Uh… well… we… know of a number of them?  And their portfolios, and general dispositions?  I’m afraid that’s a very broad question, First Among Scholars… I’m n-not sure where you want me to start.”</p>
<p id="First">“No need to lecture… at this point, anyway… it’s simply that I wanted to confirm you’re the right Crag for the job!  You see, Drivel, while I was travelling the Lowlands recently, I had quite the <i>revelation</i>.  As we know, of course, Lowlander Religious practices are deeply rooted in superstition, a stopgap for primitive minds that had not quite mastered the understanding of the forces of nature and arcana at play, yes?”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Uh…” </p>
<p>He hesitates.  No matter, rhetorical question.</p>
<p id="First">“Yes, of course we know that… our Ancestors puzzled out many of the poorly understood mechanics that led to such superstitions, after all, freeing us from them, but the Lowlanders are bereft of their genius.  <i>But</i>, Drivel, while we <i>all</i> know this to be true… it would seem that superstition is not all there is to these practices!”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“…Uhm… well, you see...”</p>
<p id="First">“No troubles, Drivel, of course there was no way to know… until now.  But while I was in the Lowlands, Drivel, I witnessed… what can only be called <i>miracles</i>.  And I state that in no poetic terms, but by actual textbook definition;  observable, tangible proof of <i>direct divine intervention</i>.  An impossible task, made possible through no means available to mere mortal beings!</p>
<p>And so, knowing that such is <i>actually</i> possible… that’s where <i>you</i> come in, Drivel.”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“…M-Me?”</p>
<p id="First">“Yes, indeed!  Your foundation in the basic knowledge of the Lowlander divinities will aid you, alongside my copious and impeccable notes about what I observed, as you seek to further uncover this hitherto unknown, and <i>untapped</i>, potential. “</p>
<p>He looks bewildered.  This actually squeezes a little bit of sympathy from you… you know that Drivel has been somewhat of a… stress reliever, for you, but based on some of the previous work he’s done, he’s not entirely useless… and, in this case, you actually <i>would</i> like to see some results from him.  Perhaps it’s best to narrow the scope somewhat at first.</p>
<p id="First">“In <i>particular…</i> I’d like you to focus, for now, on seeing if you can uncover… or possibly, <i>reinvent…</i> any divine rituals relating to, ah, <i>fertility.</i>  I’m certain there must be Lowland Divinities who consider such part of their ‘portfolios’, and, between you and me, I think having insight into such might come in handy in regards to your previous project… and may not go amiss, concerning that the Next Generation is approaching soon!”</p>
<p><i>That</i> gets his attention, and well it should.  This is the first time you’ve entrusted anyone else with any element of your research into Cragkind’s impending… difficulties.  Of course, you’ve left out the specifics, but even <i>mentioning</i> research of this nature has the potential to arouse suspicion… and, worst case scenario, lead to others discovering what you did. </p>
<p>Of course, the likelihood of <i>Drivel</i> piecing all of that together seems… well, laughably low.  Instead, hopefully he’ll take it for what it seems to be… just some forward-thinking research into a new and exciting field of magical exploitation.  That said, if it <i>does</i> turn out to all be hokum… well, at least it was <i>Drivel</i> looking into such frivolous pursuits, and not the First Among Scholars.</p>

<p>Speaking of, it looks like he doesn’t know what to say.  Again, you can sympathize… it is a somewhat… audacious task you’ve given him.  Maybe, in this instance, a little bit of carrot is appropriate.</p>
<p id="First">“I know you’re skeptical, Drivel.  Honestly, in your position, I think it is only <i>correct</i> for you to be so.  After all, you haven’t read the notes yet!  But, let me assure you; while it is a little… <i>unorthodox,</i> I wouldn’t be giving you this assignment if I thought it would be a waste of time.  In spite of what others may think, Drivel, I’ve found you to be quite the capable Crag, and immensely respect the diligence you’ve shown in previous research.  Indeed, it may very well be time for others to see, in no uncertain terms, the same things I do.  Let this task be a Trial for you, Drivel… give me some detailed insight into this, and you can consider yourself to be Scholar <i>Savant</i> Drivel!  You’ll have earned it.”</p>
<p>As you expected for someone of such meek disposition, the promise doesn’t immediately light a fire under him… but, he knows, as well as you do, that he cannot possibly refuse such an offer.  To do so would be academic suicide… it would be an admission of his incompetence.  And, admittedly, he <i>is</i> incompetent(or, at least, so you thought at first…), but that has rarely been a barrier to advancement for those with connections… and today, <i>you</i> are that connection.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“…T-That… is most gracious of you, First Among Scholars.  Of c-course, I’ll do my utmost on this new task.  Is there anything else?”</p>
<p>You smile… and this time, there may even be a tinge of genuine approval in it.  </p>
<p id="First">“As the topic is rather broad, I’d say an initial discover period is in order.  Why don’t you do some preliminary research into it, and then let’s meet again in a fortnight, see what you’ve found and how we can focus in from there?  Other than that, unless you have any further questions, you are dismissed.”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“…Of course.  No other questions.  Thank you, First Among Scholars.”</p>
<p>He stands up… and then places a massive sheaf of papyrus and vellum on your desk.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“…Uhm… your Letter requested that I compile my findings on the previous project.  Here they are.  I-I’ll get started on the new p-project, now.”</p>
<p id="First">“Ah, yes, of course!  Good Crag, Drivel.  I look forward to our next meeting.”</p>
<p>With that, he makes his way out of your office, gently closing the door behind him.  </p>
<p><i>Ancestors,</i> that was refreshing.  It’s possible that your months out in the Lowlands put you <i>a bit</i> on edge.  </p>
<p>...Speaking of Ancestors, <i>Ancestors</i>, what a stack of documents.  Drivel is nothing if not thorough… although, perhaps, one could say he is nothing <i>but</i> thorough.  On a whim, you decide to look at the Extract document on top of the stack…</p>
<p>...And then the summary.</p>
<p>And then the procedure.</p>
<p>And so on until, dawning realization sinking into your mind, you have worked your way through the entire stack.</p>

<p>Inth hell.  <i>He did it.</i></p>
<p>There is no question.  You’ve checked and double checked the equations, the arcanic balance.  <i>It will work.</i>  Provided sufficient ambient charge, of course, but that’s always an issue… and is addressed in full.</p>

<p>...Your stomach turns to stone as the shocking realization hits you.  </p>
<p>Drivel may not be the meek, incompetent tool you thought.</p>
<p>Under all that snivelling… he might be a <i>threat.</i></p>

<p>...Could <i>Drivel</i> be the one who took the Feather?  Is that how he knew to put all these distantly separated pieces together?</p>

<p>Argh, something about that still seems <i>wrong</i>.  It just doesn’t seem to fit.  You can’t quite put your finger on it, but you simply can’t see there being anything underneath his timid…</p>
<p>…underneath...</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>Once more, you reach for your desk drawer, unlocking it and opening it.</p>
<p>And then, you keep opening it.</p>
<p>You pull the drawer completely out of it’s groove, and then gently, hesitantly, you flip it over.</p>

<p>There, affixed to the bottom with some resin-coated strips, is the Feather, gleaming softly in the light.</p>

<p>...Right.  You did that, under the influence of powerful cognitive expanders, right before leaving.</p>
<p>You even factored in that you’d forget about it, so no one could trick it’s location out of you, until state-dependent memory kicked in the next time you took the expanders.</p>

<p>...As you twirl the feather between your fingers, it occurs to you that you might need to be a little concerned about how paranoid you can get.</p>

<p>Oh, look.  There is a message.  Huh.</p>

<p><i>“We request gemstones...:”</i></p>
<hr>
<p>Four thousand, two hundred and sixty seven planks.  Not a small number, but sadly, not quite large enough for what you need.  </p>
<p>Wood is a curious substance.  It is surprisingly durable for how easy it is to carve, and surprisingly hard despite its light weight.  For those without will, it is far easier to shape wood using tools than it is to shape stone.  Properly lacquered, it is waterproof, and it is even flexible enough that it can easily expand and contract as the weather changes without requiring complicated spacers.  All that said, you prefer not to use it too extensively in construction, as there is the fundamental  issue of it generally only being usable for about a century, maybe two, at a stretch before even lacquer cannot keep it from deteriorating.</p>

<p>One use that you can confidently state it is ideal for, however, is scaffolding… and that is where you currently find yourself in a predicament.</p>
<p>You are <b>Slabal</b>, and although much of your supply worries have been resolved, this is a difficulty you cannot see being easily solved.  No one, yourself included, anticipated that wood would become a constraining factor on the numerous projects that you still have lined up, but, unfortunately, that seems to be the situation you are in.  </p>

<p>You look to the Bakshish next to you.  While the answers she has given you regarding your supply situation have been largely optimistic, she seems somewhat disappointed, even embarrassed, about this particular piece of news.  In spite of this, she continues to provide details in a calm, collected manner, dispassionate and free from the excesses of drama that you’ve often noticed from her Bloodline.  Indeed, the only reason you can tell at all that the situation embarrasses her is the flush to her cheeks as the subject has come up.  That said, you’re not entirely certain why she would be embarrassed.  You may be misreading that.  Or maybe there is something you’re missing.  Speaking of…</p>
<p id="Slabal">“If I understand correctly, this is the full inventory for all three settlements, yes?  Or is this just for Eschaton?”</p>
<p id="brightpink">“I’m afraid it’s the former, Layer of the Path.  Again, I cannot believe we managed to have such an obvious oversight.  Granted, our use of Hardwood has never been this high historically, but I still consider it a failing that we did not consider this outcome.”  </p>

<p>Oh well.  There are still some projects that can be managed with what remains.  You’ll just need to be mindful of supply, and mete out appropriately until additional planks can be made.  No time like the immediate moment for that.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“I see.  When can we expect more Hardwood to become available?”</p>
<p>She hesitates.  That probably does not bode well.</p>
<p id="brightpink">“Well… unfortunately, with current demands, especially with what The Blight took from us… growing additional Hardwood was not considered a priority.  As such, no additional Hardwood has been in the schedule.  I can rectify that as soon as possible, but with a median maturation period of roughly 19.34 years… I cannot see any usable Hardwood being made available until at least 13 years from now.  And that is an optimistic estimate.”</p>

<p>...Ah.  That explains the embarrassment.  It’s not just a short-term failure, it was a failure to anticipate need.  That said, you are well aware that the majority of that need was because of the accelerated pace at which your reconstruction projects had been advancing.  Still, that does leave a somewhat immediate issue;  the amount of planks you currently have likely would not account for mere maintenance required within that period, much less for any further expansion.  That could be an issue.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“That is quite unfortunate.  We will likely require half-again this amount in order to maintain our current structures.  I assume that other avenues of wood collection have already been considered?”</p>

<p id="brightpink">“We… are still in the process of evaluating that.  Of course, the most sensible source of additional timbers would be from the lowlands… but our closest source for such was unfortunately… deforested, broadly.  Furthermore, the dangers revealed by that… incident, have many of our scholars concerned about whether Lowland wood can be easily collected; after all, in addition to identifying which arboreal structures are appropriate for our purposes, they may feature other complications to their collection that we are not currently aware of.  And that is on top of the dangers presented by the Lowlands in general.”</p>

<p>Those are valid points, although you do think that the danger posed may be a bit overstated.  However, that’s not really your place to evaluate.  It is somewhat frustrating, however, to think that in this instance, caution might cause a greater problem than it may solve, if an alternate supply of timbers cannot be located soon enough.</p>

<p>Oh well.  No sense arguing it.  There may be steps that can be taken to reduce the maintenance requirements, perhaps by utilizing additional ceramic tiling… although that would require-</p>

<p id="First"> “Ah, it seems that happenstance favors me once more.  Good morning to you, Layer of the Path.”</p>

<p id="brightpink">“Oh… First Among Scholars.  My apologies, I did not hear you approach, or I would have greeted you properly.”</p>

<p>Deep in your architectural thoughts, you struggle momentarily to bring yourself back to the present.  As you take in the scene, you notice an odd expression passing between the two Bakshish.  Sadly, the significance of it eludes you.  </p>

<p id="First">“It is of no significance, Scholar Walter.  Of course, a good morning to you, as well.  Layer, I trust that she has been assisting you to your satisfaction?”</p>

<p id="brightpink">“Yes, First Among Scholars, it is a simple matter of current stockpiles.  Little that would merit your attention.”</p>

<p id="First">“Ah, I see.  And I suppose there is no doubt you have about the… <i>satisfactory</i> nature of your assistance, Scholar Walter?”</p>
<p id="brightpink">“I would see no reason it would be called into doubt, First Among Scholars.  While the details may or may not be of varying satisfaction, the conveyance of such was transacted impeccably.”</p>

<p>...There is definitely something going on there.  While you are not certain of the specific context, the two of them are definitely acting… well, you cannot confidently claim they are acting unusually.  Bakshish have a number of internal rituals to which you are not privy, just as there are likely any number of behaviors of your fellow Onagi that other Crag may not understand completely.  This may be another one.  Regardless, from tone and posture, you can’t help but think there is some sort of argument being had here, in spite of the complete lack of disagreement.</p>

<p id="First">“Well, Scholar, if it has been conducted <i>impeccably</i>, then I’m certain it would meet my personal standards… and, therefore, you may continue on your duties.  I will handle assisting the Layer from here.”</p>

<p id="brightpink">“That does not seem necessary, First Among Scholars.  <i>I’m</i> certain that there is likely other tasks which could better use your attention, and would not wish to burden you with this <i>inconsequential</i> matter.”</p>

<p id="First">“While I <i>trust</i> your opinion on the importance of this matter, Scholar, I will note that it is not merely this function, but another which compels me to intervene.  I am simply noting that your assistance is no longer <i>required</i>, and, indeed, would be <i>redundant</i>.  <i>Vis</i>, you are dismissed.”</p>

<p>In spite of her generally placid features, Scholar Walter’s lips turn downward.</p>

<p id="brightpink">“Of course, First Among Scholars.  A good day to you.”</p>

<p>He watches as she leaves.  His expression is… well, completely unreadable.  You still aren’t sure what happened there… and, frankly, it may not be the best use of your time to try to parse it out.  You are actually curious as to why The First would insinuate himself into this interaction; you have a suspicion as to why, but you hope to be proven wrong.</p>

<p id="First">“Ah, my apologies for that exchange, Layer of the Path.  You know how it is, Scholars do tend to be somewhat defensive about the quality of their efforts.  It is a difficult habit to break… for some.”</p>

<p id="Slabal">“I see.  I do not consider it to be of significant consequence.  I believe my discussion with Scholar Walter was largely concluded.”</p>

<p id="First">“Ah, good.  Then that means I can move immediately to the topic I had at hand.”  </p>
<p>He glances around furtively. When he resumes speaking, he does so in hushed tones.</p>
<p id="First">“I assume you recall the… lowlander communication artifact that you wisely placed in my hands, yes?”</p>
<p>Ah, that.  You do remember it.  You palm the affirmative.</p>
<p id="First">“Well, I have been keeping abreast of the signals passed between, and curiously, it seems that one of the Lowlander types, the Rivers, are actually interested in expanding our trade.  Apparently, they desire ‘gemstones’.  While I considered making a barter of such for academic purposes, it did occur to me that, in truth, you would likely be the one best suited to make that call.  After all, you did head the first Trade arrangement, so it seemed only fitting.”</p>
<p>Your brow inclines slightly.  There’s a lot to unpack there.</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to your mind is actually a bit of a surprise;  it cannot help but note the… <i>convenience</i>, of this happenstance.</p>
<p>You are not a superstitious Crag, by nature.  There are some who truly do believe that the spirits of the Ancestors not only watch you, but are even capable of interceeding on your behalf.  While you do not doubt that your Ancestors have some presence among the Crag,  you have always believed that the only benefits they can give are those they passed down to you through The Path. </p>
<p>Apparently, however, this strains credulity somewhat.  You have a shortage, no ideal way to resolve it, and then literal seconds later, a solution appears in the form of Lowlanders who literally build their entire way of life around the material you are short of?</p>
<p>It’s enough to make a Crag stop momentarily to ponder the whimsical nature of the world before returning to business.  So, you do that.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Indeed, it seems that this request comes at an advantageous time.  As I was just discussing with Scholar Walter, we are suffering from a somewhat debilitating lack of appropriate timbers.  However, we by no means lack for semiprecious, or even precious, stones in return.   If you could convey back that we would be interested in Timbers, particular those best suited for load-bearing and scaffolding purposes, then we can bring a multitude of gemstones for them to choose between at our next exchange.”</p>

<p id="First">“I am most gratified to hear that I can be of assistance! Of course, I will convey your message post-haste.”</p>

<p>In spite of what he says, he does not actually move with any kind of haste.  Instead, he continues lingering nearby.  You get the feeling that he actually would like to stay a while longer.  Under other circumstances, you might have been inclined to help him with that, perhaps putting forth another subject for discussion or analysis, but there is far too much to do already.  So, you merely wait in silence.  As you have learned…</p>

<p id="First">“...Yes.  Ehem.  I should go do that now, I suppose.  A Good Day to you, Layer of the Path.”</p>

<p>...he’ll eventually get bored, and move onto his next task.  </p>

<p id="Slabal">“As well to you, First Among Scholars.”</p>

<p>Social niceties thankfully completed, you turn on your heel, making your way back towards your workshop.  </p>
<p>Hrm.  While it might be a bit too early to consider the timber problem resolved… after all, there are a number of reasons the exchange might fall through, or they may not have the appropriate timbers… you nevertheless consider it to be highly probable that the issue is resolved.  And, with that in mind, that alters some of the priorities you had.  </p>

<p>In particular… it may be prudent to take the on-hand timbers and utilize them in a project that, if completed <i>before</i> the upcoming exchange occurs, could actually facilitate said exchange significantly…</p>
<hr>
<p>Your muscles ache.  While normally, such aches and pains are trivial to ignore, this time they are calling your attention  not due to intensity, but rather, due to the <i>novelty</i> of the pain.  You are familiar, sometimes warmly so, with the trivial aches and pains that come with a treacherous peak traversed, or a sheer cliff scaled, or a frigid stream forded… these are all the marks of your ability, your specialty.  This pain, however, seems to have its origins in <i>in</i>action.  Your feet, your calves, and, appropriately, your glutes all give subtle complaint for how you’ve been holding this position; standing straight up, shoulders squared, eyes straight ahead.  Appropriately, you think, because it all helps to highlight how much ceremony is a <i>pain in the ass.</i></p>
<p>You are <b>Embebi</b>, and you are bored out of your mind.</p>
<p>Of all the things you were dreading with the return of Echo and the Euclast, this particular issue blindsided you; as Embebi Arckerova, Named and Titled Stalker Actual, you were of course given a place of honor for any Rite or Ritual of note which occurred within the Great Circle.  <i>Technically</i>, such a place already existed for you just because of the Title you bore, but while beforehand it was fairly trivial to skimp on such events, your position now, and the active role you have taken in guiding the Aggro in Echo’s absence, means your absence would be <i>noted</i>.  And so, even though you managed to avoid your <i>own</i> naming ceremony, you find yourself caught as the Senior Named and Titled recognize the achievements and valor of those warriors who fought in the ‘Coldwater Incident’.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, having to put up with such ceremony wouldn’t be so bad… unfortunately, thanks to the Esteemed’s order that those Crag capable of carrying on the Ancestor’s Legacies be recognized and named, you’re not having to deal with one or two namings, but a full <i>half dozen</i>.  On top of that, Galfin’s Art is in full swing today, as the majority of those recognized are among his Euclast, and Ancestors Condemn if he doesn’t take every opportunity to spe<i>cif</i>ically pro<i>nounce</i> e<i>ver</i>y <i>word</i> and <i>line</i> with the <i>ut</i>most <i>clar</i>ity.  </p>

<p>Confronted with such brain-draining pomp, it’s little wonder that you prefer to focus on the <i>physical</i> pain you are experiencing.</p>

<p>You feel a massive hand land upon your shoulder, lightly tugging you, relatively speaking.  Glancing backwards at the source, you are surprised to see Echo of Blood; you must have really spaced out there, because last time you saw him, he was standing at the head of the ritual; looking at where he was, you can see that some of the Senior Senret have already moved to close the massive gap he left.  </p>
<p>He gestures with his head, clearly indicating for you to follow him;  While you have been dreading this encounter, you find that you dread it slightly less than the prospect of listening to Galfin pronounce the Recognition of Valor for the fourth time today.  Before you manage to make a conscious decision, you find your feet moving automatically, falling in step behind his massive form, adopting the longer stride necessary to keep up with your sib.  </p>

<p>Another hallway.  Another corridor.  And, ultimately, another meeting room, located on almost the opposite side of the circle from where the other one is.   Or, rather, was.  The Onagi removed it when they renovated the Circle, replacing it with an infirmary.  The irony is not lost on you.  Here, however, once more the two of you take your places on opposite sides of the narrow table. For the first time in many months, you meet his gaze, staring into his gray orbs.  While you expected anger, or accusation, instead what you find there… confuses you.  There is anger, of course.  There’s always anger.  But it’s alloyed with an expression that you can’t quite place.  You’re not sure if that’s better, or worse, than just seeing anger.  Finally, he speaks.</p>

<p id="Echo">“...It looked like you were about to succumb out there.  I figured it would be better to have you walk away than have to be carried away.  It’s a bit more seemly.”</p>
<p>...The first words he’s spoken to you in over a year, and it’s a jab.  Quite frankly, you rate that as a best-case scenario.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“I wouldn’t have been the first there to get carried away, and by many meanings.   I cannot fathom what possessed you that you would let <i>Galfin</i> master the ceremonies.    Crag are made to endure, but we are all as chalk to his chert when it comes to Drama.  I fear those that remain on the field will face a Pyrite Victory.”</p>
<p>A small smile, almost nonexistent, rests upon his lips. </p>
<p id="Echo">“<i>Intensive</i> training, Embebi.  Far too long you’ve escaped from this particular hardship, so you’ve built up no resistance.  You were always one to learn through doing, so I figured I’d throw you off the steep end, climb or die.”</p>
<p>How very like him, if true.  You suspect, more likely, that Galfin was ‘persuasively persistent’ about an opportunity to express his Art.  Still, you decide to play along.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“How fortunate I am to have such a dedicated instructor, so willing to sacrifice my sanity for my own good.   Sounds good on tablet, training like that, your students only ever fail once.  If that’s the case, however, to what do I owe this magnanimous rescue?”</p>
<p>His smile fades at that, and that inexplicable expression returns.  You can’t help but feel nervous.</p>
<p id="Echo">“Perhaps… I have begun to understand that there are trainings that sound good both on and off tablet.  And, while I do not doubt your endurance, it occurred to me that if any one of us should be deserving of reprieve, it should be you.  I have heard much in a short time.  A great deal of it concerns you.  Embebi… once, I had asked if you would shoulder a burden alongside me.  From all I have heard and seen, it seems I was mistaken in that assertion.”</p>
<p>Ah.  Jocularity over, you guess.  And it explains what is likely the real reason he called you away from the ceremony.  With everyone at the center of the Circle, less chance for the upcoming shouting to be overheard.  Before you can respond to that accusation, however, he continues.</p>
<p id="Echo">“In truth, it would appear that you would not require my shoulder at all.”</p>
<p>...uh.</p>
<p id="Echo">“When I descended into the Lowlands, at your suggestion, I believed it would be little more than a lark.  A temporary distraction, an opportunity to vent my frustration against weak and ignorant lowlanders who believed they would have something worth showing me.  What I actually found there, I would never have forseen… an irritating pantoum.  But unlike all others, this repetition did not leave me lesser at its conclusion.</p>
<p>With each passing week, I found more and more of myself laid bare, certain knowledge confronted by harsh, flensing truth.  It was pain, but a bearable one, a <i>desirable</i> one, that pain that any True Aggro welcomes as a masterful tutor.  So constant, so entrancing it was, that I did not truly note the passage of time.  It took many months for me to realize that in my gluttony for excoriating realization, I had inadvertently abandoned the very people I was intent on preserving.”</p>
<p><i>Ancestors.</i> And  you thought you had gotten your fill of Art for today.  Poetry is not quite as grating as Drama, when it comes to it, but you find yourself groaning internally as Echo delves deep in his grab-bag of gold-plated words.  He probably was practicing this speech…  but, thinking on that, it’s actually somewhat relieving.  Since Echo’s generally not one for bait-and-switch monologues, you’re starting to think you might not be in trouble after all.</p>
<p>You immediately regret that line of thinking when Echo, leaning easily across the narrow table, puts his palms on your shoulders.  He looks into your eyes with that unfamiliar expression.  Way to jinx yourself, Embebi.</p>
<p>Crud.  You must have winced, because then he winced.  So, also, way to play it cool, Embebi.</p>
<p id="Echo">“...Embebi.   <i>I’m sorry.</i>”</p>
<p>-asdfkg-</p>
<p id="Echo">“There is so much that I have done… so much I have laid upon you, asked of you, and given so little in return… and yet, in spite of the fact that time and time again you have proven yourself, still I found a place in my foolish mind to doubt you.  I doubted your wisdom, I doubted your truth, and as I traveled the Lowlands, I doubted your ability.  As I finally sought return, having had my fill of that Mad place, I doubted what condition the Aggro, nay, the Crag would be in upon my return.  Yet another foolishness of mine to claim.  I returned to hear of what you have done, what you have achieved, what you have <i>become</i>, and…  and so, I am Sorry.  For doubting you.  For not believing you.</p>
<p id="Echo" class="whisper">...For hurting you.”</p>
<p>For a long, long moment… it felt like minutes, when it was… well, probably still minutes, actually… you just sit there, eyes locked with Echo’s… Saltik’s… parsing what he’s saying.  Quite frankly, you don’t know what you should feel.  Your instincts aren’t much help here;  they’re still stuck on trepidation, or perhaps outright fear, and you don’t think that’s going to change any time soon… especially not in this cramped room.  </p>
<p>Lacking any kind of instinctual or rational response for this outpouring of… contrition?... you fall back on what any Crag would in this situation.   <i>Rote.</i></p>
<p id="Embebi">“Saltik Bergenich…. Echo of Blood… if it is Forgiveness you seek, <i>I have none to give you.</i>”</p>
<p>His expression hardens.  No, hardens isn’t the right word.  His expression <i>solidifies</i>.  From uncertain to certain.  He knows the words.  It is a blessed familiarity.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“If you have Failed as you claim, then you have not failed me.  You have failed Yourself.  The Aggro.  The Crag.  I cannot forgive you.  Neither, can you forgive yourself.  You must not seek Forgiveness.”</p>
<p id="Echo" class="whisper">“ I  must seek Penance,” he intones.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“You must seek Penance,” you intone simultaneously.</p>
<p>The two of you repeat the words every Aggro youth is certain to hear at least once during their training.  Penance.  An old word, archaic, but it carries all the right weight to it.  Forgiveness, at a price, and one which proves you are striving to earn it.</p>
<p>That said, while the rote saying is comforting, you… don’t really know how to properly <i>apply</i> it in this context.  It’s not like this is actually a teachable moment or anything.  Unfortunately, Saltik looks just as lost as you.</p>
<p>You sigh. </p>

<p id="Embebi">“Sib… I understand.  I think I do, at least.  But… well, how else can I put it?  I accept that you are… “ </p>
<p>Eugh.  You don’t even really like saying the word ‘sorry’.  It sounds just… <i>wrong</i>, coming from the <i>Echo of Blood.</i></p>
<p id="Embebi">“...that you <i>regret</i> some of the choices you made.  And, honest said, theres a fair number of them where I agree, you should regret them.  I can’t say if I agree with you on all counts.  But...  arrgh, how do I say this! It’s the most obvious thing in this blighted world, but I can’t find the right words for it!”</p>
<p>Twisting your shoulders, you shift yourself from his grasp, and then slap both of your palms on the table in front of you.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Sib, you’re the <i>Echo of Blood</i>.  You can be wrong, you can be impulsive, fourth hell, you can even be <i>stupid</i>.  But you can’t be <i>sorry</i>.  Symbols don’t get to be <i>Sorry</i>.   You are the Chief Among the Aggro, the Greatest of our Kind, and so no matter what eye-opening revelation you might have had down in the Lowlands, I can’t <i>allow</i> you to lose your confidence over it!  SO...  how do we approach this?”</p>
<p>You find yourself back on familiar grounds as Saltik’s expression grows stormy.  Right.  Even when making a point, he doesn’t appreciate being called <i>stupid</i>.  That’s a button you need to be <i>very careful</i> when pushing.</p>
<p id="Echo" >“...Embebi, I’m... trying to clear the air here.  I know that things… they haven’t been right between us.  Not since the argument.  It’s been near on two years, and still, I can feel your fear.  And I know it wasn’t just the bones.  It's because you saw what I could do, what I could say… what I could <i>justify</i>.”</p>
<p>So this is all about that.  You don’t like to admit it, but he’s right.  It wasn’t just the injury.  It was how, when he spoke of the strength of the Animals, he spoke with more than rage… he spoke with <i>jealousy</i>.  </p>
<p id="Echo">“I was struck by a madness of my own, a lust for an advantage, <i>any</i> advantage, which could make the future of the Aggro look less bleak.  I was desperate.  Angry.  At my own failings, and at the fate that had been thrust upon us.  The fate of the Bloodied Generation.”</p>
<p>He looks away from you, staring at the burns that still warp his flesh.  In all likelihood, the scars are permanent now; not even magic can remove them.</p>
<p id="Echo">“...I should have listened to you.  Heeded the madness in my own words.  Even then, I think, I knew you had spoken the truth of it… the truth of these <i>Wolves</i>… but I was so tired of facing nothing but poor fortune that I… well.”</p>
<p>Uh oh.  The way he said <i>Wolves</i>.  Of course, you knew well that no matter what, Echo would not have taken kindly to your dealings… but the way he says it makes your blood run cold.</p>
<p id="Echo">“I’m glad I <i>did</i> listen to you the second time.  What I saw in the Lowlands, what I found… it helped to open my eyes.  To see how far madness had consumed me.  ...And to see how mad this new world we inhabit is.  I thought I had seen the worst of the horrors this world was capable of.  I’m getting fatigued of how often I can find a new low.”</p>
<p>He looks back at you.  There’s a fire in his eyes now… not just anger, but also determination.  You struggle to control your face.  You have a sneaking suspicion that…</p>
<p id="Echo">“You were right, Embebi.  By all the words I heard while travelling the Lowlands, the Wolves are known by their true nature.  These Wolves are not a source of salvation… they are a <i>pestilence</i>.  A blighted, malformed sickness, left adrift in the wake of their fallen masters.”</p>
<p>Of course. That would be the way of things in your life, wouldn’t it?  A vein of Irony so rich it could put Eparchy to shame.   First you condemn, and he defends.  Now, he condemns and you… better keep your mouth shut, if you know what’s good for you.</p>
<p id="Echo">“And yet, in their absence, these wolves seek to see the return of the <b>Animals</b> by even the most heinous means.  They sabotage.  They infiltrate.  They sow chaos.  It is even said that they have found a way to distill the Blood of Madness into a poison, as capable of spreading that sickness as surely as an <b>Animal’s</b> bite. They are a Curse… and yet, perhaps, they may be my Absolution.”</p>
<p>Fuck, fuck, <i>fuck</i>.  Don’t let it show.  Don’t let it show how his words effect you.  You should know nothing of this.  You shouldn’t react, except perhaps in revulsion.  You certainly shouldn’t be questioning how such accusations could possibly be true.   You especially shouldn’t fear that they <i>could</i> be true.</p>
<p id="Echo">“I have taken it upon myself.  For their crimes, for what they are, for what they seek to become, I will see them stricken from The World.  This will be my Penance.  To the Crag.  To myself.  To you.”</p>
<p>Fuuuuuck</p>
<p>He looks away again.  Although the fire in his eyes is still there, his expression becomes… pensive.</p>
<p id="Echo">“...And to ensure it is done correctly, I will look to you to guide me.”</p>
<p>...what?</p>
<p id="Embebi">“What?”</p>
<p>His lips purse, like he’s tasting something overly sweet.</p>
<p id="Echo">“...Even one such as I can learn, with sufficient blows to the skull.  I will not once again heedlessly endanger our people in my attempt to do right by them.</p>
<p>In the Lowlands, I heard a saying, spoken by the Blades as I wandered among them.  It threw some of the greatest failings of my life into sharp relief, and helped me to realize, finally, why I so often find myself frustrated in these uncertain times.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“...What was the saying?”</p>
<p id="Echo">“ ‘Measure Twice, Cut Once’.  A simple wisdom, given to a youth, and yet so evocative of their martial creed.  Even from a culture as alien as theirs, it spoke to my Aggro soul.  </p>
<p>Even with the greatest weapon, the strongest body, you will do little more than flail wildly if you do not have the measure of your foe.  But the warrior who has the measure of his foe, so certain as to know him twice over, will need but one cut to fell him.</p>
<p>Embebi… I must call upon you to be my Measure.  To find these Wolves, to discover where they live… and then, to tell me how they <i>are</i>.  How they act, how they march, how they war.  It is a great task I give you, for it seems they may be as well hidden as Eschaton itself… but it is my belief that they reside within the very same range as us.  How else would they be so capable on the mountainside, as to surround a trained Stalker such as you?  But I do not expect they will perform such a feat twice.</p>
<p>It is a painful thing to ask you, Embebi, to help me conduct my Penance, but I will be Condemned by the Ancestors before I once more let my pride and desires blind me to what is best for our people.  ‘The Sharpest Weapon is Nothing Without the Sharpest Mind to Wield It.’  I once told you I am a Weapon that Bleeds.  Even though it was said in the throes of rage, it held every ounce of Truth then, and holds every ounce of truth now.  I am a Weapon, Embebi.  And you are the Mind that shall wield me.”</p>
<p>An elegant poetry, expertly crafted, seeming a great wisdom… and, of course, an even bigger pain in your ass than the Ceremony.</p>
<p>What’s more, even under the best circumstances, it’s easier said than done… but, actually, that might work to your advantage.  After all, as it turns out, you might not need to worry about Echo launching an immediate assault at the first sight of Wolves… If he’s serious about wanting to go in Forewarned of their numbers and abilities(for once), then that might give you the time you need to figure a way out of this… or, you think traitorously(or is it patriotically?), you figure a way to ensure the Crag <i>can</i> win this war.  With Echo working with you, instead of at his own purposes, that seems far more likely than it did a year ago… but you still don’t put great odds on it.</p>

<p>But, regardless of what you ultimately do… there’s little to be gained by refuting him now.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“As you say, Sib.  My Stalkers and I will learn all we can.  When the time comes, we will do everything in our power to ensure that this time, we will not go in blindly.”</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn’t say anything about how blindly you’re going into this <i>right now…</i></p>
<hr>
<p id="Esteemed"> “-considering everything I have heard,  I cannot help but think it was a triumph of the deepest wisdom, of the truest divine guidance, that led to your presence at this gathering, <b>Jahnni</b>.  I can scarcely imagine how things might have progressed in your absence.  You have performed the duties of your Creed beyond all expectations.”</p>
<p>In return for such high praise, you give a gentle smile.  You briefly consider thanking the Esteemed for her words, but think better of it; best to let her say everything she wishes to.  After all, it would do no good to interrupt her ancient wisdom.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“...Before I continue on, I must ask, as one Elpahka to another...What did you think of the Lowlands?  Of its people?  How did they Impress upon you?”</p>

<p>You had anticipated a question like this.  Fortunately, you have already concocted an answer that should please her, and which also appeals to your own sensibilities.  You speak quietly, but confidently, <i>normally</i>, as befits one of your stature addressing one such as the Esteemed.</p>

<p>“I have reflected a great deal on what I witnessed, Esteemed Elpahka.  And what I have discovered comes as a surprise even to myself.  The Lowlands, it’s people… the Impression I have is one of <i>familiarity.</i></p>
<p>It is an easy thing to see the differences.  The differences of our bodies, the differences of our minds.  But it is likewise easy to see the similarities.  The way they strive for a better future, for themselves, for their progeny.  The way they plan and prepare, fearing for the worst, but faithful that preparation will see them through any calamity.  The way they rely on each other, trusting each to do their part.</p>
<p>They are not like us.  But they are also not <i>unlike</i> us.”</p>

<p>You study her reaction clandestinely.  What you see is deeply satisfying.  Although she sought to suppress it, there is a twinge of smile upon her ancient lips.  She has seen the wisdom of your words.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“A fitting impression, Jahnni.  One that I believe serves me well, a powerful counterpoint to all that I have heard otherwise.  It is easy to see strangeness in the Lowlands.  Unfortunately, it seems that makes it also easy to ignore all of its … <i>familiarity</i>.  What a fitting word.</p>

<p>I am pleased, Jahnni.  Beyond pleased.  Were you of a different Creed, I may have already seen fit to grant you a Name in this very moment. However, in recognition of your traditions, I instead see no reason I should not grant your earlier request.”</p>

<p>So you had heard correctly.  You did not have much time to get up to speed before being summoned, but you had heard that the Elpahka had been encouraged to find fitting souls for any number of Name which had found itself Orphaned.  Unusual, but these are unusual times.   Of course, you had no need for such.  It was not the way of your Creed.  The Mountain Mothers practice a deeper humility.</p>
<p>While she has not moved much during your debriefing, The Esteemed now takes upon a more formal pose, resting one hand against the precious slab resting upon her table.  She stares at you, her head held as high as it can, milky eyes staring straight at you.  Her other hand is held, palm up, toward you.  Her every motion, every stance, it all declares one truth; an <i>Authority</i>, peerless, unquestionable. </p>
<p>It is time for a Proclamation.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“Mountain Mother Inferior Jahnni.  The foremost of your Creed was lost to chaos and carnage.  Since then, you have been without full guidance, forced to continue on by whatever means were necessary, as all Crag were forced to do.  Now, in these times of recovery, you have proven to I, the Esteemed Elpahka Ledret Blakenova, that there can be no question as to your wisdom, your diligence, and your Right.  Therefore, it is in my Wisdom that I affirm that you are worthy of the Title of Mountain Mother Superior, in absentia of the prior Superior.  Though the traditional succession has been broken, let it continue once more, firm in the knowledge that of all your Creed, it is known to be in Full Truth that you are the one most deserving of the Title.  Let your noble soul guide your Creed to serve the Crag, as all Elpahka are called to do.”</p>

<p>For once, it is an actual struggle to keep your grin from exploding on your face.  Though it is not proper for one of your Creed to feel such overwhelming pride at this accomplishment, you find it impossible to quench in this moment.  You know that you will need to perform a corrective penance for this internal outburst later, but for now, you must simply endure.  </p>

<p>With the Proclamation heard, there is little more to discuss with The Esteemed.  In short order, you are dismissed from her presence, free to return to the remnants of your Creed.  You walk the streets of Eschaton, drawing in the sights and sounds; while it is pleasing to once more be in such familiar surroundings, you will not be truly comfortable until you have returned to the Temple Monastery.</p>

<p>From the Central Square of Eschaton, it is possible to pinpoint the Temple Monastery of the Mountain Mothers, built into the very slope of the mountain.  The climb up will be long and arduous, even for a Crag, but it is a trip you have endured many times.  As you begin your climb, you cannot feel the fatigue or cold, so buoyed are you by your achievement… and by the knowledge you must share.</p>

<p>Stepping foot within the ancient walls of the Monastery, you finally feel a true comfort.  Built into the very living mountain itself, the Monastery was able to avoid the worst of the Extermination… as well as avoiding the determined hands of the Onagi in recent years.  It may now be the single oldest structure built by Crag hands… if such hands could be said to even have been Crag by the time it was made.</p>

<p>Swiftly, you reunite with those Mothers who remain in Vigil.  Bearing the word of the Esteemed, they are quick to recognize your elevated status… hardly surprising.  There are few among the remaining mothers who would contest your higher stature;  the Esteemed’s Proclamation was merely to make your position official for any who may have had doubts.  There can be no room for such uncertainties.  Especially not with the monumental times in which you may live.</p>

<p>With their recognition, the word is sent forth.  An Agglomeration is to be held.  All of the Mothers, from across Eschaton, are to congregate, to recognize the new Mountain Mother Superior, and to hear your wisdom. </p>

<p>Hours pass.  You harden yourself for what is to come.  Right before the Agglomeration begins, you pass the point of no return; you claim the Circlet of the Mountain Mother Superior.  A simple circlet of iron chain, holding a single inset oval of Lapis Lazuli against your forehead.  When nestled securely against your temples, the links are tightened, then closed; once donned, by tradition, you will wear this circlet until the day you go to join the Ancestors.  In spite of its tightness against your skin, it is surprisingly comfortable.</p>

<p>It is time.  The Mothers are assembled.  The Agglomeration has begun.  You must share your wisdom.  For the sake of yourself, and all those present, you hope that it is truly wise.</p>

<p>“Mountain Mothers.  You know who I am.  But know now that, through the blessing of the Esteemed, I have been fully recognized.  I am your new Mother Superior.  Through my service to the Crag People in the tumultuous reaches of the Lowlands, I proved to her my worthiness. In the days to come, I hope to prove that worthiness to each and every one of you.  I do not exaggerate when I say that there will be ample opportunities for me to do so.</p>

<p>Mothers.  I have gone to the Lowlands.  I have seen its people.  I have heard their ways, seen their actions, listened to their words.  And above all else, what I have seen has opened my eyes;  for all their strangeness, for all their apparent madness, one truth has rung clear… they are so much <i>more</i> than we have thought.”</p>

<p>As the assembled Mothers rest within the central chamber, you walk the perimeter, hand gliding across the ancient frescoes and reliefs which hold the truths of your Creed apparent for all to see, and for only the Mothers to truly <i>comprehend.</i></p>

<p>“They are organized.  They are cultured.  They are civilized.  At every encounter, I found myself amazed at how far they have come from the darkest times… from the times of the First Generation.  It is clear that the perils which engulfed all our kind did not prevail as long as was feared.”</p>

<p>Your hand stops on one etching in particular; an inscription, holding words that were spoken by ancient tongue, written by ancient hand.</p>
<p>It is nothing so superstitious as a <i>prophecy</i>.  It is nothing so crude as a <i>portent</i> or <i>auspex.</i></p>
<p>It does not predict the future;  It merely elaborates upon <i>A</i> future.  A future which may be present.</p>
<p>It is a circumstance. A condition.  A <i>contingency.</i></p>

<p>“Mothers… my observations leave little doubt in my mind.  There is more than enough evidence, and more is there for the finding, obvious as daylight.  One need only pass among the lands below to see them.  By following in my footsteps, you will see that I speak only the Truth.</p>

<p>The Contingency is clear.</p>
<p>The Descension Is Imminent.“</p>

<p>A defeated wind howls against your bastion.  It promises searing truth.</p>

<p><b>Economic</b>: <i>With resources both rare and regular tricking in from Egersis, the stockpile shortages which threatened to bottleneck further growth are being slowly replenished.  Alongside the future promise of additional organic materials from the Rivers, soon there should be no obstruction barring the path to Slabal’s penultimate, then ultimate, stages of her Reconstruction efforts.  Before those proceed, however, it seems that opportunity and necessity have finally met at the correct time; the time has come to see Eparchy fully realized into what she intended it to be.  </p>
<p>Ever since she attended the otherelves potluck, she has realized a vital, concerning truth; aware of Eschaton’s existence, it is only a matter of time before one of their number will stumble upon the ancient secret of the Crag.  To forestall this, she believes it necessary to create a lure; a settlement, easily accessible to the Otherelves, located at a relatively low elevation, so that their full attention may become focused on it rather than the true heart of the Crag People.  With it’s bounty of Iron and other raw materials, and it’s position close to the Stream of Consciousness, Eparchy is ideally suited to be this Lure.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Infrastructure(Investment)</b> skill to apply the aspect Dejima District to Eparchy.  Constructed of attractive stones, and built to house any number of Otherelf merchants, ambassadors, visitors and otherwise, the district is separated from Eparchy Proper by a beautiful wall.  Though by no means impenetrable, the message it conveys to all who come is clear; ‘You are Welcome… conditionally.’</p>

<p><b>Political</b>: <i>The Mountain Mothers are but one of a handful of Creeds held by the Elpahka of Eschaton; while Bakshish have their Studies, and Aggro their Specialties, these Creeds allow each Elpahka to find the way in which they may best serve the Crag People.   True to their namesake, it is the calling of the Mountain Mothers to address those issues of the Crag which must be undertaken free from passion or feeling, handled with a heart of stone; Funerary rights, hospice, and similar matters of mortality and woe.  Had The First’s initial solution to the Blight been accepted, it would have been the Mountain Mothers who would have had to shoulder the burden of executing it.</i></p>
<p><i>This is their Responsibility, Harshness… or, rather, the Responsibility for which all know them.  Within their deeper chambers, among those who are initiated, another Responsibility is held, one dating back all the way to the First Generation.  It is this Responsibility which now compels Mother Superior Jahnni to direct her peers to bold action, for though she believes in truth that the Descension is upon them, she must have the consensus of the Mothers before she can proceed in confidence.  And so, the order is clear.</i></p>
<p><i>Go to the Lowlands.  See what she has seen. See what is.  Know what must be.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spycraft(Espionage)</b> skill to represent the Mothers going forth to see and gather information from the Lowlands.  Their form of espionage is most unconventional, however; it does not rely on blending or going unseen, but rather, upon a fundamental misunderstanding of intent.  The Mothers go into the Lowlands as curious observers, travelling in groups of two to three;  it remains to be seen whether those who receive them will identify the nature of their questions as more than merely curious.</p>
<p>For the first of their investigations, a choice is made owing to simple matters of distance.  Of all of the Homelands of the various Lowlander kin, the closest by far belongs to the Fires; Surt, it is called. Once there, where they go next will rely heavily on what will occur, but plans are in motion for the future...</p>

<p><b>Military</b>:  <i>Time is running out.  This truth weighs heavily upon Embebi;  her sib’s vow to find the home of the Wolves will be difficult, if not impossible, to shift.  She knows that, much like how Vesnia must now labor to keep her superiors from committing to prideful folly, now she must do the same if the Crag are to have any chance of surviving.   Only one option seems even close to viable;  a notable discovery, that which she was initially searching for.  If the Wayward Kin, or whatever else lurks within those dangerous reaches, can be found, it may prove ample distraction… and, furthermore, may provide fitting example of the ability for Crag and Wolf to operate together.  Though her sib’s claims of Wolf treachery shake her to her core, she cannot deny what she has seen and heard; perhaps through this trial, she can prove to him, and to herself, that the sickness that would lead to such treachery is not fundamental to their kind...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use <b>Reconnaisance(Pathfinders)</b> skill to search the marked terrain in the indicated Search Area.  The search is being restricted to a single area, owing to the dangerous nature of the terrain and the approaching onset of winter; caution is the primary watchword here.  Though time is short, haste makes waste; Slow is Smooth, and Smooth is Fast.</p>

<p><b>Mental</b>: <i>In the latest of the numerous indignities that have been piled upon Drivel, he now finds himself faced with an unquantifiable task.  The First has found Religion, in the most literal way possible, and now wants to know how to exploit it.  While the nature of Lowlander divinities is technically counted as past of Lowland Esoterica, all of his knowledge is focused on the Whos and Whats, not so much the Whys and Hows.  Still, of all the tasks given him so far, this one is the least… impossible?  After all, all The First initially requested was information collated about this ‘new’ form of magic; it’s not as if he expects Drivel to go from nothing to a fully fledged ritual, right?</i></p>
<p><i>...Right?</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spirituality(Research)</b> skill to pull together preliminary notes regarding Lowlander gods of fertility… reading between the lines, probably best to consider that in any sense of the word.   While there are obvious choices like Theria, for her natural inclinations, or Almada, for her prosperity, it may be worth considering figures like Bronix, for his own brand of fertility, or Caelestros, as she is said to be the Patron of all Elfkind.  However, there is little sense in disregarding any of the known divinities right now, since this is just the discovery phase.  Who knows who may be best suited to aid the Crag?</p>


<p><i>As Drivel works on his assigned task, however, The First must consider his own prospects;  While it is easy to chalk up his recent… overreactions to the perils encountered in his latest expedition, he cannot shake the feeling that something about recent events has… well, shaken him.  There is so much that he took for granted that has been challenged; the nature of Divinity, the truth of the… Lycans… the character of his informant… and even the competency of Drivel. Drivel. If he cannot properly grasp Drivel, then he’s thoroughly screwed.</i></p>
<p><i>When confronted with such doubts, there can be only one answer; Nose to the Lectern, burning the midnight oil.  In his latest expedition, he collected much that may help fill in the gaps in his culminating his research into The Lowland Ilk.</i></p>
<p>Working in secret, trusting only his own notes, relying only on his own mind, The First will motivate aspect Stone the Crows using a Fate Point. This allows him to use the <b>Academics(Research)</b> Skill to attempt to resolve the needed research for The Lowland Ilk solution to the Threatened Generation.  Though it was many seasons ago, he still has a great deal of old research to roll into his new, providing a Boost die on this check.</p>


<p><b>End of Turn</b> </p>

<p><b>Results-</b></p>
<p><b>Economic</b>- The Dejima District goes up without a hitch. Really, did we expect anything else? We could talk all day about how you are just coming off of a building material shortage, how making the district ostentatious enough to impress visitors requires a lot of materials, and that doing this right is fairly difficult. We could mention that with the upcoming need for gemstones, careful resource management will be needed to allow both projects. We could caution that this is not just a show floor, but also a distraction and a defensive fortification. Crafting it properly will require careful nuance to be both inviting and firm in its limits. To entice visitors, but discourage them from exploring further. To be both beautiful, but also provide good sight lines and defensive positions in case a visitor decides to try to take advantage of you.</p>

<p>We could mention how all this makes what appears to be a simple mercantile district into an actual major undertaking. How this would be a challenge for anyone to create, how it’s a marvel in and of itself, something to be taken as quite a challenge.</p>

<p>But this is Slabal we’re talking about.</p>

<p>It’s not a problem.</p>

<p><b>Political</b>- Thankfully, no one gets thrown out of anything. The Mothers report that things went generally well, but the fires were extremely confusing. The Mothers were questioned at the gate, but after explaining that they were merely here to talk with locals they were allowed in.</p>

<p> Surt is, on a calm day, a riot of activity, bickering political factions, religious nutcases, random bursts of flame, and bizarre arcanic activity. They did not visit Surt on a calm day. It seems that one of their political leaders, the Hunger, was on trial for being an <b>Animal</b>. The Mothers… aren’t really sure why that’s a thing that requires a trial, or how that could even be in question really, but it seems to be the topic on everyone’s lips. The normally fractious factions in Surt are going at it full tilt while the Mothers visit.</p>

<p>They were generally unsure how to negotiate this volatile landscape, so they decides to play it safe. They stuck to public areas and talked to regular people. That alone was wildly eye opening to them. They are utterly shocked that such a society could be so chaotic and still function. The fires are passionate and argumentative, wildly disparate and contentious with each other to the point of violence, and yet there is something there. Some kind of bond that the Mothers don’t yet understand, but that is plain for them to see. Something deep and powerful, something that connects them all, something that the fire elves themselves don’t seem to really recognize exists, but it drives them nonetheless.</p>

<p>There is great power and potential here, and it has nothing to do with elemental arcana.</p>

<p>The Mothers leave on reasonably good terms. Among all the other bizarreness in Surt, a few mystic seeming crag is hardly cause for alarm. They would likely be welcomed back, they believe. Unraveling the strange enigma that is the fire elves is going to take more than one trip, it seems. They are a strange and poorly understood group, even among lowlanders, hells, even among themselves. The Mothers, though, clearly understand that there is something to their strange intensity, an order to their chaos, a method to their madness. The Mothers are eager to learn more.</p>

<p><i>While you technically failed to pass an Espionage check, the counterspy elements in Surt were a bit busy this season. You didn’t get any detailed information, but you also didn’t anger your “host.”</i></p>

<p><b>Military</b>- Vesnia is not able to help you directly in your mission to the high peaks. Her group is still reeling and recovering, and breaking in the replacements for their losses. They can get replacements, apparently, so that’s a bit unnerving news I guess. Still, she gives her all the mapping information she has as well as spare supplies as you make your way up the difficult pass to scout the treacherous peaks on your own. The best that she can offer is her solemn word that if you don’t make it back as scheduled, she will take her pathfinders to look for you as soon as they are able. Not much comfort, as that would be winter.</p>

<p>Embebi is on her own.</p>

<p>This, of course, means that Embebi’s victory belongs entirely to her. All those months and months of practice, all that careful planning, all that development of cautious methods and deliberate strategies all come into play, as does a little luck.</p>

<p>The weather stays good, with clear skies and very few storms. That’s nice, becuase it’s fucking freezing up here and you can barely godsdamned breathe the fucking air holy hells. It takes all of Embebi’s skill and endurance to traverse the terrain, and all of her caution and discipline to do so without getting anyone hurt, but that is exactly what is accomplished.</p>

<p>The territory is successfully mapped. Unfortunately, you didn’t find your wayward kin this time. You did, however, find evidence! More discarded tools, and a few discarded bodies. Only just a few though. The evidence suggests that the group made it through here. Tracks, old camps, and the like. Their trail leads roughly northwards. They are likely within one of the two marked territories north of here, the territory directly to the east of here is less likely.</p>

<p>Also interesting is the effects of this High Mountain Peaks Aspect the territory has. In addition to Pathfinding or Rangers, any military actions taken by a faction that does not have an accurate map of the area automatically takes one difficulty upgrade (or extra challenge die if it’s a check without difficulty dice) for every territory of this they cross through. You, of course, now have an accurate map of this territory so you know the precious few safe passages through it.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting revelation, and evidence as to why the wayward kin went this far. Not even <b>Animals</b> could effectively wage war all the way up here. Maybe they were hoping the wrath of the mountains would hit any pursuers worse than it hit them.</p>

<p>It's not over yet. There is still jagged and desolate peaks to check, still your wayward kin to find. As Vesnia demonstrated last season, the high mountains are deadly even to the most skilled and prepared. Despite this, Embebi has proven that it can be done. She is back on the trail of her kin, and has proven that she the capability to reach them.</p>

<p>For the first time since she took the name, she truly feels Unbound.</p>

<p><b>Mental</b>- Drivel keeps things simple.</p>

<p>In all honesty, he narrowly avoids overwhelming himself. He starts off with the major deities, but ends up unsatisfied. The most obvious answer, Calestros, doesn't really satisfy him. She's the deity of elves, sure, and they're trying to make more elves, but past that… well… he's not sure. She doesn't have much of a portfolio for fertility, and his texts mention her chaotic, unpredictable, and outright mad personality. Maybe not the most stable start. He keeps looking.</p>

<p>Theria and Bronix both directly have fertility as part of their portfolio. Theria, however, deals specifically with animals. Animals don't plan things, so the deliberately planned methodology of the Crag would clash with that - not to mention the possibility of downright gross side effects. Theria followers like animals. Sometimes they really like animals. Ew.</p>

<p>Bronix has a similar problem. Sure he loves fertility and "boinking" (his words), but he's the god of half-breeds. He's highly chaotic by nature and seems to revel in mixing the most wildly disparate creatures possible willy nilly. You might be able to channel that if you go with First's lowlanders idea, but there's a strong chance that Bronix might deliberately throw any careful lineage plans you have in favor as making things as deliberately weird as possible. Suboptimal.</p>

<p>Almada's right out. She's all for human prosperity. We have enough of that thank you. Same goes for most of the other greater deities  - the have no interest in elves.</p>

<p>Drakauluos might work, but they would have to be integrating draconic or reptilian traits into their bloodlines, and it seems he sometimes gets carried away.</p>

<p>With no answers there, Drivel turns to lesser deities. That's where he really almost loses his train of thought.</p>

<p>The Bakshish have information on literally hundreds of lesser deities. That information however is extremely disjointed. Some of the entries are literally a single sentence, sourced from lowlander rumor and heresay.</p>

<p>Drivel almost finds a candidate - Ahanneah, the goddess of sex and carnal pleasure. Something about demons in there, but that's probably no big deal. Kinky, but it could work. Carnal pleasure generally results in fertility, right? Yeah, that's close enough.</p>

<p>Drivel goes through a few days of… uh… detailed research on Ahanneah and produces one unnecessarily detailed depiction of a Church of the Voluptuous Ass in Eschaton. This is very embarrassing in hindsight.</p>

<p>As the season draws to a close and he dreads the prospect of showing First he has produced nothing but a drawing of a giant ass in the middle of Eschaton, Drivel suddenly realizes he's approaching this wrong.</p>

<p>Deities are not a buffet of domains and portfolios that you pick from like a buffet. They are individuals, fiercely competitive with eachother and always pursuing their own goals. Whatever deity is picked will doubtlessly shape the Crag's future in the direction of their own objectives.</p>

<p>If that's the case, there's only one choice.</p>

<p>While all the other deities would see the Crag as tools in pursuit of their desires, to Calestros, the Crag are her desires. Calestros doesn't seem to care how her followers are elves, just that they are seeking their own facet of perfection. Hey, perfection seems to turn up a lot in reference to Calestros. If the Crag's goals are perfect elves and Calestros' goal is perfect elves… what could go wrong?</p>

<p>Drivel maybe doesn't perfectly understand the situation, but he has landed at a good destination. Calestros is the best choice. The Crag will receive an upgrade to develop any fertility related rituals with Calestros as a patron.</p>

<p>First has like a bunch of work in front of him.</p>

<p>In some ways, it's frustrating. Every lowlander trait he discovers opens up another two or three related traits to catalog and document. As he finishes documentation on traits, his to-document pile only seems to grow. There's a staggering amount of variation in the lowlanders, far more than the Bakshish ever anticipated. Every trip he has taken to the lowlands confirms this.</p>

<p>And yet, that's why he finds the work oddly soothing. Yes, this is grunt work. Yes, he could accomplish this much faster with a team instead of doing it alone. He decides, however, that he wants to do it alone </p>

<p>This is clear cut. Discrete. A clear Path with a clear endpoint and a clear measure of progress. Sure his work pile grows, but he also places down an impressive amount of decisively completed work.</p>

<p>It's a nice change of pace from the decidedly nonsensical problems he faced in the lowlands. I mean a… the… uh… Lycan? Talking to him? Helping elves? Helping his contact, who was somehow also an animal? Preposterous.</p>

<p>Wait, was he just writing out traits that he saw in the <b>Animal?</b> Eugh! Disgusting! Unfathomable! He disposes of that page. Probably.</p>

<p>In the end, he doesn't conclusively complete the catalog. He does, however, make a significant amount of quantifiable and concrete progress. It's turning out to be a bigger project than anticipated, but that's a good thing! The ever growing list of positive traits in the lowlands means the chances of the lowlander solution to viability is ever more feasible.</p>

<p>The research isn't finished, but real progress has been made. In addition to the boost die, further Research on the Lowland Ilk will receive an upgrade.</p>
