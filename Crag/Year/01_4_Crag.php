So, have you thought on my question?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah. &nbsp;That. &nbsp;You got distracted. &nbsp;This view of Eschaton is distracting. &nbsp;Every time you look out, you see more work to be done. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c25">&ldquo;No, Ledret, I did not. &nbsp;I was distracted by worldly matters. &nbsp;However, I&rsquo;m afraid I am ill suited to answer the question. &nbsp;The past is as it is. &nbsp;To consider a single change to it is to unravel cause, and effect, and thus render all other assumptions moot. &nbsp;All I can tell you is this; if at any point I had thought of better choices, better ways, I would have told you, suggested them. &nbsp;I do not think you would have been so proudful as to reject them out of hand. &nbsp;I cannot claim to always follow your wisdom. &nbsp;But I can confidently state that that is because you are better suited to wisdom than I.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c11 c25"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She doesn&rsquo;t react. &nbsp;You hope that your response is helpful. &nbsp;All you know is that it&rsquo;s the truth. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the truth is not always helpful.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pagoda is silent once more. &nbsp;It is quiet enough that you don&rsquo;t hear, but feel, the heavy tread of boots ascending. &nbsp;Then you can hear the tortured click of that stone that you still need to repair. &nbsp;Either that&rsquo;s all the Elpahka together, or&hellip;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You ascend the stairs, two steps at a time, like usual. &nbsp;However, there is no pep in your step today. &nbsp;Too much as of late has conspired to ruin your mood.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">You are </span><span class="c22 c10">Echo</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Without any hesitation, you have thrown yourself into the fangs and maws of the </span><span class="c22 c10 c28">Animals</span><span class="c4">, and spilled so much of your </span><span class="c4 c2">own</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;blood that their foul taint had no chance of taking root. &nbsp;With nary a moment&rsquo;s thought, you have barrelled into creatures one and a half times your size, with the only consideration being how it would taste once you triumphed over it. &nbsp;You cannot count the number of times that you have been threatened with death, dismemberment, infirmity, and pain, and faced it all without fear.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately for your mood, as you approach the pagoda, your gut is wrenched with trepidation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not additional danger you fear. &nbsp;No, what you fear is that, for the first time in your longish life, you are forced to consider that the Esteemed, who is about to decide your fate, and the fate of all Crag, may not actually be all that wise.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There had always been hints of it, in retrospect; how she dithered on The Blight, how she tolerated The First&rsquo;s casual disrespect; you shudder, remembering his sharp, acerbic tongue during your recent journey. You are immensely thankful that your Stalker, Embebi, handled most of the back-and-forth on that far-too-long expedition, but even then you found yourself all too often at the wrong end of one of his tantrums. But all that paled in comparison to what you have learned; the moment that opened your eyes was the report from a small number of Euclast who encountered an Outsider on patrol.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">She parlayed with them. &nbsp;Bargained with them. &nbsp;Let her decisions be </span><span class="c4 c2">rejected </span><span class="c0">by them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">And, in the end, she </span><span class="c4 c2">trusted a lowlander</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c2">let them go back to their lowlands</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">You were never devout in your study of </span><span class="c4 c2">The Tome</span><span class="c4">, but as one of the Aggro, you knew good and well that you and the Euclast&rsquo; descent into the Lowlands was one of raw necessity, and one which was constantly fraught with the peril of discovery. &nbsp;You and yours had to be constantly on guard, from both others and yourselves, lest you accidentally let slip where your homeland lay. &nbsp;It was better to die than to loose your tongue, for already once discovery had led to the greatest tragedy ever recorded&hellip; the LAST tragedy ever recorded in </span><span class="c4 c2">The Tome</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">And, in a single day, in a single </span><span class="c4 c2">hour</span><span class="c0">, she overturned that ruling, and made all you and your sacrifices pointless.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is not an act of Wisdom. &nbsp;It is not even an act of Madness. &nbsp;It is an act of Foolish Carelessness. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The kind typical of the Infirm.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are not looking forward to this meeting. &nbsp;You dread what you may have to do if your suspicions are confirmed.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are not looking forward to this meeting. &nbsp;You dread what you may have to say if your suspicions are confirmed.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Echo arrived. &nbsp;Many, but not all, of the other Elpahka have arrived. &nbsp;There were some whose duties were too precious to relieve, even for something as important as this.

there is no such sign.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"><br>Worse tidings come from the fruits of my Associate&rsquo;s labors. &nbsp;The Heads of many Studies have toiled night and day to discover the truth of the Blight, to uncover its weakness. &nbsp;They have succeeded. &nbsp;And they have found that it&rsquo;s weakness&hellip; is our demise.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The Blight lives in the soil. &nbsp;It spreads itself keenly and eagerly, infecting any plant it touches. &nbsp;The smallest clod, the tiniest strip of filth, is sufficient to carry the Blight to another doomed field. &nbsp;Worst of all, while any plant lives in that soil, the Blight will continue to live. &nbsp;Seedling, Shoot, or Stalk, it does not judge; it will take its toll, and live on. &nbsp;In truth, our efforts to counteract our losses, harvesting earlier, planting soon after, constantly attempting to make up for the shortages of the last harvest, only exacerbated it&rsquo;s growth. &nbsp;By now, the Blight may exist in all but our most carefully cultivated plots. &nbsp;If it were not for the actions of the Onagi, inspired by Slabal, holder of the Inspired Bloodname of Nanock, The Layer of the Path, there may have been no uninfected crops remaining at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;Odd, that. &nbsp;It was not uncommon to recognize the accomplishments of others, but he named none of his Associates before naming Slabal. &nbsp;You wonder why. &nbsp;Still, this seems a good time to interject.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c20">&ldquo;A Dire Tiding indeed, First Among Scholars. &nbsp;Tell me, with all that you have learned and seen, have the Bakshish devised a solution to this Blight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nods to you. &nbsp;There is no trace of his arrogance now. &nbsp;You can see the sorrow set upon him.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;The Blight has now taken a dreadful toll, and one that is impossible to ignore. &nbsp;What I share with the Wisdom now, I ask that you keep in full confidence, for it&rsquo;s widespread knowledge could be a telling blow to the heart of our people. &nbsp;<br>Our agriculture&hellip; has utterly failed. &nbsp;Our seed reserves are all but gone. &nbsp;Even if we were to plant every last grain, even if all of it could be spared the Blight, we would not be able to feed our people. &nbsp;Worse than that, to even attempt another harvest would only hasten our demise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">With all that we have discovered, we find that there is only one possible solution to the Blight.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We must immediately harvest or destroy all of the current crop of Snow Lentils. &nbsp;We must render the soil devoid of plant life. &nbsp;Indeed, we must poison it so no weed, no fungus, no plant at all may take root. &nbsp;And we must leave our fields so poisoned for a full season.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Perhaps two.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To say you are shocked is an understatement. &nbsp;The gasps echoing in your Pagoda reveal how terrible this is. &nbsp;Perhaps in the times before the Extermination, it would have been possible to let the fields lay fallow an entire season without trouble. &nbsp;Perhaps even as soon as few years ago, it would have been possible to do so and still conceivably survive. &nbsp;But now, already taxed to the brink? &nbsp;It is a death sentence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the End of Eschaton.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To your shame, you cannot compose yourself properly. &nbsp;Too quickly, your mind is assaulted with images of wasting and famine. &nbsp;Of Death. &nbsp;Instead, it is another voice that rises to quiet the panicked murmur which was arising.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c25">&ldquo;The situation is suboptimal. &nbsp;With our reserves already so taxed, we could not expect to have enough to feed the population should we cut our current harvest short, let alone delay the next one, or even the one after that. &nbsp;Even if we were to significantly expand the quartzhouses, which allow us to carefully screen for the Blight, I do not think we would make up the difference. &nbsp;Have you found a solution to this shortage?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c11 c25"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Blessed, precious Slabal. &nbsp;Her voice was so cool, so collected. &nbsp;A calming influence for a panicking people. &nbsp;You can even see it in The First&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;How he squares himself, not despondent, but&hellip; resigned.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He takes a deep breath, steadies himself. &nbsp;You can hear his voice shaking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there are no guarantees, but&hellip; we&hellip; </span><span class="c16 c2">I</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;have devised a solution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The first is to do as The Layer has suggested. &nbsp;We must have more of these Quartzhouses. &nbsp;I wish I could claim they were to feed our people&hellip; but, instead, they must be used to replace what we have lost. &nbsp;Once the fields become usable once more, we will need the seeds and pulses from these safely contained planters to be able to produce a full harvest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">However, in this, we still face our ultimate shortage; usable soil. &nbsp;While numerous enchantments exist to purify or enrich soil, these have so far proven useless against the Blight; we still do not fully understand why. &nbsp;Instead, I will guide the Bakshish on studying </span><span class="c19"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-everlasting-dung/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1576645751306000">ways</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;of creating fresh, totally new soil, similar to how some of our greatest are able to create water, or even food. &nbsp;This capability could be of immeasurable utility to the Crag people; although we find our local territories barren, if we had the ability to produce our own rich loam, then our only true limit becomes surface area!</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">...But, while a promising new capability, I cannot imagine this being developed quickly, or easily. &nbsp;In truth, I can find no other workable solution to&hellip;

Indeed, when the Aggro descended, these elves were not our enemies, did not seek to extinguish us, but fought a common purpose to ours, fought to protect themselves from Extermination, as we did. &nbsp;And now, having met with one of these Lowlander elves, I believe the truth of it is clear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">The enemies of the First Generation are gone. &nbsp;History has swallowed them, and in our seclusion, we escaped whatever calamity claimed them. &nbsp;Now, The World is filled with brand new enemies, brand new horrors, ones which threaten not just us, but all of our Elven kin as well. &nbsp;The gods have spoken, and we must respond; The Elven People have need of us, and we have need of them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">In my discussion with the Traveller, I learned of a number of nearby encampments. &nbsp;We will go to them, speak to them, and let them know that we exist; for now, until trust can be established, we will conceal the exact location of Eschaton, but we will barter with them. &nbsp;Crag craft is fine, and we have plentiful resources, for the Bones of The World themselves shape to our will. &nbsp;We will speak to them, trade with them, and through them, we shall alleviate our ills until our own lands become sufficient again, until we can become whole once more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">Through them, we may even learn once more of the long lost knowledges gained by the First Generation; we may relearn how the made </span><span class="c20 c2">The Tome</span><span class="c8">. &nbsp;We may reforge The Path, and alloyed by our newfound kin, it may be all the stronger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have spoken true, and clear. &nbsp;The way is certain. &nbsp;The future, hopeful. &nbsp;You open your eyes to look upon your Wisdom, the best of the Crag people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something is wrong. &nbsp;You do not see hope. &nbsp;You see fear. &nbsp;Anxiety. &nbsp;Anger. &nbsp;Concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pity.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You glance quickly over to Slabal. &nbsp;She is looking at you, the way she looks at people. &nbsp;Impassive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You look to The First. &nbsp;He is sneering. &nbsp;Angry. &nbsp;Sickened.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh no.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What have you done?</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">don&rsquo;tgrindyourteethdon&rsquo;tgrindyourteethdon&rsquo;tgrindyourteethdon&rsquo;tgrindyourteeth</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You weren&rsquo;t sure what to expect when the Esteemed interrupted you&hellip; admittedly, you were hesitating, after all, it&rsquo;s not everyday you have to square up and admit that the only options left to your people are horrible&hellip; but to have been interrupted for that mad tripe?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4 c2">ludicrous</span><span class="c4">.

They aren&#39;t hunters by nature or training, so instead of pursuing the decided to drive game into their waiting hammers. When detached scouts couldn&#39;t reliably get the animals to flee in a predictable nature, someone had the bright idea to start fires in order to force them to flee in specific directions.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">Given the current condition of the Aggro, this went as well as you&#39;d expect. Quite thankfully and quite by luck, this expedition happened during the rainy season so the wildfires were extinguished before they rolled across the entire lowlands. Your Aggro weren&#39;t so luck. Like the game they were trying to drive, they found themselves fleeing and frequently trapped. The piles of random supplies like ladders, ropes, ten foot poles, and nets that the Aggro packed in their &ldquo;survival&rdquo; kits ironically do provide the tools for some to escape the flames, but there were still many trapped. The Echo did everything he could to save his soldiers, but even he was driven back by the flames.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">The Aggro have taken </span><span class="c7 c2">Heavy Casualties</span><span class="c7">. If they spend two turns Garrisoned and inactive, passive recruitment and convalescence will bring this up to </span><span class="c7 c2">Light Casualties</span><span class="c7">. Alternatively, you can use the </span><span class="c2 c7">Drill</span><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;trapping to recruit fresh replacements for the losses.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">In addition, the Echo is shaken by his failure to halt the losses. He will take a Setback die next turn.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">Despite all this, the Aggro were technically successful. They bring back as much food as they are able to carry. Thanks to their losses, however, it&#39;s far less than projected. It&#39;s not enough for everyone.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">You can use the Aggro&#39;s supplies to negate one of the stress points dealt by the Blight next turn- either to your Economic track by distributing it to those most critical to the operations of the city, or to your Morale track by distributing it to those most in need.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c10">Pathfinding- </span><span class="c11 c7">Layer Slabal in fact finds the trip wildly unpleasant. In fact, no crag elf has been this far from Eschaton since the Aggro left for the war. The trip doesn&rsquo;t go well, for quite a long time. They struggle with mapping and accurately measuring distance for over a week before Slabal has a bright idea.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">We&rsquo;re aiming for an </span><span class="c7 c2">entire ocean</span><span class="c7">. Specifics don&rsquo;t matter as much. Keep Eschaton directly behind us, setting sun to your left, rising sun to your&hellip; No, </span><span class="c7 c2">damnit, </span><span class="c7">never eat sea weed&hellip; Rising sun to the left, setting sun to the </span><span class="c7 c2">right</span><span class="c11 c7">. Keep going that way until you hit ocean, then move to your right along the coastline until you hit elf.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">Slabal isn&rsquo;t able to map anything, but late in the season he and his pathfinders are able to reach Fort Alfyr. They are greeted by bewildered yet welcoming Blade Elves who tell them they are about a week early for the Potluck...</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c10 c17"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c10">Mental- </span><span class="c7">The First&rsquo;s plan turns out to be an issue of scale more than skill. Indeed, the initial experimentation with the Defoliate spell is extremely promising. Several gardens are saved, and usage of the spell allows new glass house gardens to be constructed safely. Most excitingly, soil in gardens razed by Defoliate indeed starves the blight after about a week of waiting. With a glass house over a defoliated blighted garden, the First is able to successfully plant and grow crops in soil that had previously been blighted. There </span><span class="c7 c2">is</span><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;a way to kill it!</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">The issues seems to be in scaling it up. Even a small sproutling carried by the wind can feed the blight. For this to work, you&rsquo;d have to defoliate </span><span class="c7 c2">all</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;of the farmland in Eschaton and continue the effect for a solid week, two to be safe. Straight up killing that much plant life requires an </span><span class="c7 c2">astronomical</span><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;amount of magical energy, and the First simply isn&rsquo;t able to get it all together for now.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">Still, a proof of concept is made. A few rare strains of grain are saved. A glimmer of hope in the first truly blight-saved growth is found. The First receives a </span><span class="c17 c10">bonus die</span><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;on his next attempt to use magic to kill the blight, even if it&rsquo;s not in a ritual.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">----</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">&quot;Home&quot; is only a word. To the crag elves, it is a word that conjures fear and anxiety. Eschaton has been home for as long as any elf can remember. Eschaton is the </span><span class="c7 c2">only </span><span class="c7">home that the crag elves can even conceive of. Yet now, they are at risk of being starved out. Even the crag elves cannot eat cold unyielding stone. The crag elves aren&#39;t just anyone, though. Though they are stubborn and hard headed, they are resilient both physically and mentally. Though they are showing cracks, others would have shattered under the strain they have endured. Eschaton </span><span class="c7 c2">will</span><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;survive.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">You are not, and will never allow yourselves to become, refugees in your own home.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">For completing your first turn and in recognition of the steadfastness with which the crag elves have faced utter disaster, you are rewarded with one skill point to distribute wherever you would like. In addition, you receive one refresh point which may at this time be exchanged for a stunt of your choosing.</span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c11 c30 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c7">----</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Burned, but not yet Broken, the Aggro&rsquo;s bounty makes its way into grateful Crag hands. &nbsp;Seeing the most immediate need to be reinvigorating the strength of the people, the nutrition is distributed first among the Samra and Onagi to restore their flagging bodies&hellip; and minds. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c12"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The results of the </span><span class="c10">Conventional Warfare</span><span>&nbsp;check are applied to prevent another tick of </span><span class="c2">Morale</span><span class="c11 c12">&nbsp;damage.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">While many of the bloodlines made great strides this year to attempt to aid a Failing Home, One stood head and shoulders above the rest. &nbsp;The Elpahka (political) bloodlines, though frequently relying on the Onagi or Bakshish to carry them out, were nevertheless responsible for the careful orders and wise use of resources which allowed the Crag to survive in spite of the increasing scarcity of necessary nutrition and services. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c11 c12"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Having fewer failures than any other bloodline this year(although some call cheating since they outright skipped one), the Elpahka receive the Skill point to invest into the Political Spectrum. &nbsp;<br>They eagerly place it in </span><span class="c10">Recovery, </span><span>hoping to use it to help Eschaton get back on its feet once this scarcity finally passes.<br><br></span><span class="c2">However, praise also needs to be given to the unsung throng of Samra laborers; the essential core of Crag culture, they often find their labors directed in direct aid of one vital task or another. &nbsp;Without them, no other Bloodline could function for long. &nbsp;Though times have been tough, Samra are tougher. &nbsp;They will endure the coming year with stoic fortitude.</span></p><p class="c3"><span><br>To represent the general nature of Samra helpfulness, the Refresh point is not traded for a feat, instead allowing more copious use of Fate Points to get things done.</span></p>
