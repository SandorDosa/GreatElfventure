<p>A sharp wind screams over the mountanside.  Funneled through the streets of Eschaton, the powerful fall winds are further concentrated into a gale as they pass through it's narrow confines.  Were it not for the curtains now drawn around your pagoda, the noise would be almost deafening.  This, in and of itself, would not be entirely unwelcome.  Even in Noise, there may be wisdom.</p> 

<p>You are <b>The Esteemed</b>, and for the first time in many months, you feel you truly deserve that title.  It has been a long, difficult path, but, through the guidance of the Ancestors and the will of the gods made manifest, you were able to tread it, and your people followed in kind.  </p> 
<p><i>Your people</i>.  A smile tugs at your lips.  For so long, it had been difficult to remember what that truly meant.  When all seemed lost, when every Fate seemed to be against them, your people were still strong... and you were strong alongside them.  Although you would never wish to repeat the trial which came before you, the lessons it taught were plentiful.  The chief among these; to guide a people, you must be among them.</p> 

<p>That said, probably not today.  Too windy.  Wisdom must give way to pragmatism in some cases; while you do not doubt Miigra's ability to find her way, there is a nonzero chance that such a gale might snatch you up entirely.  Not exactly the end you were hoping for.</p> 

<p>You quickly cut off the line of thinking about <i>what</i> end you were hoping for, exactly, by opening your eyes once more.  They burn, but once more are clear, allowing you to again make out the new object that has taken permanent residence upon your normally clear table.  A single sheet of scraped vellum, it nonetheless was one of the most precious of gifts that was bestowed upon you by your recent trials.  So precious was it that you had the Onagi will it encased within clear quartz, and even now Bakshish youths are copying this page, and many others like it, over and over to ensure no single point of failure exists.</p> 

<p>A bold title, and fifty simple lines beneath it.  So little, and yet, so precious.</p> 
<h2>The Ledger of the Exodus</h2> 
<p>And, a little below halfway down the page, scribed in careful hand;</p> 

<p><i>Blaken, the Insightful</i>.</p> 

<p>You place your hand on the thin slab.  The finish is perfect.  Completely smooth.  Cold to the touch.<br></p> 
<p>Your past. Your future.  To the Crag, they are one and the same.</p> 

<p>And, now that the present has been resolved, it is the future to which you must now turn your attention.</p> 

<hr>
<p>A sharp wind screams against your robes, and it promises to blow you off the mountain.</p> 
<p>You take another step against the blustering gale, one of a small number of Crag who likewise have business to attend to so urgent that they would endeavor to struggle against the elements themselves.  Other, wiser Crag have already holed up for the day; only those providing the most essential services are still out and about.</p> 
<p>Essential services including, apparently, answering the summons of ancient crones.</p> 
<p>You are <b>The First</b>, and you are fairly confident that you are too sober to be dealing with this.  Or maybe not sober enough.  All you can say for certain is that you are not the correct level of sober right this moment.  You might have had an opportunity to fix that, were it not for the fact that the Elpahka sent to summon you was <i>very insistent</i> that the summons be answered right that moment.  Very insistent, and very big.  You bet that if you had tarried, she'd probably be carrying you to the pagoda now.  Maybe that would have been for the best.</p> 
<p>You lean forward into the wind.  Not far to go now.  If you can just-</p> 
<p>A sudden crossbreeze staggers you.  In your inhibited state, you forgot to account for the wind dynamics in the intersection.  You feel your balance failing.  You stumble, trying to right yourself, but it's no use.</p> 
<p>Oh well.  Nothing for it.  You draw your arms in and prepare to eat shit right in the central plaza.  At least not many people are out right now.</p> 

<p>...Funny, it usually takes less time to fall than this.</p> 
<p>And usually the pressure from the wind doesn't feel like arms.</p> 

<p>You crack your eyes open. Sturdy arms embrace you, arresting your fall.  Gazing up, you see a familiar, placid face; one you have not had the opportunity to see in many weeks.  Or has it been months?</p> 
<p>Amethyst eyes, blinking in the wind, gaze down at you, piercing through you.  Amethyst hair, nearly the same color, whips wildly around in the wind.  </p> 

<p>It's difficult to articulate what you are feeling right now.</p> 

<p id="Slabal">"Are you well, First?  You seem to be having some difficulty standing."</p> 

<p>Roused by her words, you immediately stumble to your feet.  If you could articulate things better right now, it would probably be a pretty creative stream of invectives.  Fortunately, before any of those can slip loose, what little people skills you have manage to assert themselves.</p> 

<p id="First">"Ah, ah, Fine, Layer, perfectly fine! Perfectly erect, thanks to you!"</p> 
 
<p>By the time your brain catches up to your mouth, your internal monologue engine seems to have thrown a belt. </p> 

<p id="Slabal">"I can continue assisting you with that, if you require.  I can confidently state that I have significant experience with such."</p> 

<p>You feel like you should be able to think some words right now, but it seems words no do good in think hard at time.<br>Fortunately, there's a part of you that seems to be sufficiently exasperated at your general incompetence with any form of social interaction that doesn't involve yelling.  You begin walking once more, this time taking the treacherous crosswind into account.  It takes you several paces before you even realize you were moving again.</p> 

<p>By the time some semblance of conscious thought reasserts itself, it's now far too late to make any kind of response and not have it sound awkward and dumb.  Best to cut your losses, you figure.  For her part, the Layer seems no more perturbed than ever at your complete lack of response.</p> 

<p>You almost welcome the climb up to the pagoda that you must now endure.  It's good to be able to direct your ire elsewhere.</p> 


<p>By the time you finally manage to struggle past the weighted curtains currently keeping the gale at bay, you are feeling much more like yourself; nothing like physical exertion, infantile embarrassment, and general indignity to chase away any lingering intoxication you may have been enjoying.  Now, it's time to see what the fourth hell was so important that you had to trudge through all of tha-</p> 

<p>A dozen heads turn to gaze at you as you enter, windblown and disheveled.  The congregated Named and titled of Eschaton stand in a broad circle, illuminated by half a dozen crystal lanterns distributed throughout the room.  Their expressions range from mild annoyance to mild amusement.  Chief among the latter are those expressions belonging to your own Heads of Studies.</p> 

<p>-this wasn't just a normal summons.  This was a call of the Wisdom.</p> 
<p>Your mind, somewhat scattered of late, manages at this moment to recall a brief interaction with a young Elpahka you had a day(or two?) ago.  While the details were fuzzy, there was something about needing an ultimate report on the Blight.  You remember handing him a "root-or-bega" for his troubles and sending him on his way.</p> 
<p>This also puts the somewhat brusque nature of your summons a few minutes ago into context.</p> 

<p>Okay.  You think you can conclusively say that you weren't sober <i>enough</i>.</p> 
<p>Curiously, you don't feel any more embarrassed than you had already.  There must be some sort of upper limit.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">"Welcome, First Among Scholars.  While I believe I speak for all of the assembled Wisdom when I say that we appreciate your diligence in pursuing your <i>studies</i>, it would be preferable if you could learn to proportion your time appropriately in the future.  In any case, now that all are present, we may proceed.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">Given the circumstances, I believe it is appropriate to get directly to the current matter.  Renyan, holder of the Keen Bloodname of Elemat, First Among Scholars.  This wisdom has assembled to hear of the current nature of the trials which have troubled the Crag over the past year, to reaffirm our understanding of the solutions to them, and to discuss what our next steps will be, not just for this difficulty, but for all of the Crag.  We shall start by hearing your report on such."</p> 

<p>You respond without missing a beat.</p> 

<p id="First">"Of course, Esteemed Elpahka.  I am prepared and ready to illuminate all of the Wisdom on this matter."</p> 
 
<p>You absolutely aren't.</p> 

<p id="First">"Assembled Wisdom.  Less than a full year ago, we were all brought together to fully discuss the nature of the troubling disease we dubbed The Blight.   Much of the information I provided then has now been confirmed, and so I will not unduly waste time by repeating it.  Instead, I believe your interest lies in what stage the Blight is at presently.  This salient information, I can convey to you, hopefully to your satisfaction."</p> 
 
<p>You don't have any documents, don't have any notes, haven't practiced any of this.  Hopefully, if you keep talking, you'll figure out what to say eventually.</p> 

<p id="First">"Our efforts to cleanse the soil of Eschaton of the Blight met with great resistance; even knowing how the disease lived, travelled, and remained, our ability to directly act on this information directly was limited.  However, while we could not conclusively act on it directly with the resources on hand, there were many who contributed all that they could to do to see to it that what could be done, was done.  Among these are many of my dutiful colleagues, the Heads of their Studies, who pursued every conceivable avenue of research to give us the edge over this difficult task.  Those such as Olafan, holder of the Staid Bloodname of Turogh, Head of the Studies of Aetherics.  Edrian, holder of..."</p> 
 
<p>Okay.  That'll buy you some time.  As you rattle off the Heads of Studies by rote, you take a moment to consider what you need to tell them.  You wish the answer was simpler.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, the ultimate fact is that for all your research, you <i>still</i> don't understand where The Blight came from, why it's so resistant to tried-and-true methods of clearing disease from cropland, how it so tenaciously attacks the hardy crops that your ancestors left you, or even if your geniunsane plan to just burn it all out will turn out ultimately successful; while a small number of the fields are beginning to return to service, your saved soil returning life to them, all it would take is a single slip up, a single field insufficiently burned to ash and dry, cracked earth, and the entire thing could spring back up full force.  And although you've run the numbers, and they are looking ever more positive, until you truly understand how this damnable Blight works, there will <i>always</i> be the chance it could threaten your livelihood again.  All it would take is some fool Samra, or some ignorant youth, or even a malicious hand of some Lowlander or <span class="animal">Ani-</span></p> 
<p><i>Come to naught.  Wasted.  Purged.</i></p> 
<p>...</p> 
<p>Your brain is doing a pretty excellent job of coughing up really important information long after it was supposed to.</p> 

<p>The rubbings of those runes are still on your worktable.  At the time, you considered them a curiosity, likely some bizzare and vile practice conducted either by desperate <span class="animal">Animals</span>, or, far more likely, some sick Lowlanders who sought to emulate them.  That was before you knew just how desperate your own fight against the Blight was going to be.  How close it had come to doing what they could not have done before.  How near it was to destroying Eschaton, more surely than their engines and soldiers ever did.</p> 
<p>But if it wasn't just some barbaric sacrifice... if it was, instead, an invocation to whatever malign spirits that They would deign to worship... then that could explain <i>everything.</i></p> 
<p>In spite of its tardiness, you still find reason again to exult in your unparalleled intelligence.  Time to check in on where you're at in your rote list.</p> 
<p>Ah, good, almost done.</p> 
<p id="First">"-aturgical Matrices.  It is through the efforts of these great minds, and many more, that we have arrived at our current understanding of The Blight.</p> 
 
<p id="First">The Blight can be Contained. We know that it lives in soil.  If that soil is isolated, it cannot travel.<br>The Blight can be Starved.  It feeds on plants, but without them, it cannot spread and propagate.</p> 
<p id="First">The Blight can be Killed.  Though immune to purifying magics, starvation and flame allow us to eliminate all traces of it.</p> 
<p id="First">And because of these fundamental truths, in time, with careful practice, The Blight can be Eliminated.</p> 
 
<p id="First">But it cannot be <i>Prevented</i>."</p> 
 
<p>You scan the room for reactions to that.   You see smiles drop from faces, worried expressions appear.  Good. They should be worried.  </p> 

<p id="Esteemed">"While your proclamation was quite dramatic, First, it is lacking in substance.  What do you mean by it?"</p> 

<p>Oh, of course.  Only the Esteemed can be dramatic, everyone else should be naught but echoes of her voice.  Fuck that.</p> 

<p id="First">"What I mean, Esteemed Elpahka, is that although we have learned much about how to Combat the Blight, we still know precious little of its origins, its source... and whether, even if we should eliminate it down to the last grain of dirt on Eschaton, it could ever appear again.  Without that fundamental knowledge, we will <i>always</i> be at risk.  </p> 
 
<p id="First">Fortunately for all of us, I have been intently focused on this particular facet of The Blight, its <i>Cause</i>, while my learned colleagues busied themselves with handling it's <i>Symptoms</i>. And while, even for all efforts I have put into this research-"</p> 
<p>-about three minutes and counting-</p> 
<p id="First">"- I have been unable to discover any conclusive evidence, I do have some promising leads.  However, in order to capitalize on them, I'm afraid I must humbly request a broader freedom of action."</p> 
 
<p>There is a pause. You force yourself to keep looking directly at the Esteemed.  While it would bring you no end of joy to see the deflated expressions on the pompous faces of your "colleagues", now it is important to show firm purpose.  After all, this may be the excuse you have been looking for.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">" 'A broader freedom of action.'  First Among Scholars, it concerns me to think that you believe that what you have already done does not demonstrate the broad freedoms given to you.  Without consulting myself, or the assembled Wisdom, you took it upon yourself to enact this curious plan which saw much of the ancient heritage of Eschaton put to crude purpose.  Even now, many hallowed halls which once stood proud testament to what we have endured are now little more than defiled, filled with filth and loam.  While I will not question the intent behind this plan, I question whether it could not have been achieved in a more sensible manner.  And yet, even after hearing of this casual defacement of our history, I allowed it to continue.  </p> 
<p id="Esteemed">Considering that I have already allowed this, First, what possible request would you have?  What would stay your hand, compel you in this circumstance to ask permission, rather than beg forgiveness?"</p> 

<p>Hah! As if you would <i>ever</i> beg forgiveness from her.  While you admit that you've made mistakes and missteps, there is no one person in the whole of Cragkind <i>more</i> responsible for your current predicaments than her!  If only she had <i>listened</i>...</p> 
<p>But enough of introspection.  Now is the time for bold action.  A wicked smile curls on your lips.</p> 

<p id="First">"Esteemed Elpahka, soul of the Crag people, and all of our assembled Wisdom, I... beg that you attend to my words carefully.  They will seem unusual.  They will even seem Unorthodox.  But there is reason behind them, and more than reason, necessity.</p> 
<p id="First">Esteemed, by your own words, you have said that in order for the Crag to go forward, in order for us to understand what we must understand in order to thrive in this uncertain time, that we will need to Go Forth from Eschaton.  We will be forced to seek for knowledge and wisdom within the wilds of the Underlands,  within the abandoned and barren stretches of Mountainside which surround us.  By ancient custom, by traditional wisdom, the ones entrusted to Go Forth are the Aggro.</p> 
<p id="First">But, as much as it pains me to say this-"</p><p>Heh</p> 
<p id="First">-, I am afraid that this ancient custom does not take into account the idea of those Going Forth should Return with Wisdom Intact.  While none would question that the Aggro are the bloodline who can be trusted to go into such hostile environs, to face our foes, and return with victory clutched in hand, their attempts to return with detailed knowledge and intricate accounts of said environs have been... <i>inadequate.</i>"</p> 
 
<p>You feel your pulse quicken.  Your senses, dulled by what may perhaps be an overindulgent habit, now are brought to full sharpness as adrenaline floods your system.  Mindful of your throat, you glance around the room, looking for the Great Lummox to come bounding for you once more.</p> 
<p>Curiously, you find him totally absent.  Odd.  Not unwelcome, mind you.  But Odd.  Fortunately, it looks like the other Named Aggro in attendance are showing more than enough chagrin in his stead, but unlike him, have the decency to keep their place.  That's a relief, then.</p> 

<p id="First">"What I would request, Esteemed, is the permission to pursue the wisdom you had previously laid forth, to seek answers in the Lowlands, and to do so with keen eyes and minds, rather than capable bodies and brawn.  I would request a new Study, one which has not traditionally existed, nor had ever been alluded to.  I would request that I be allowed to establish the Study of the Exterior, to be populated by those whose Bloodlines give them keen insight into such an unusual field of knowledge, and to be granted full access to the talents and knowledge of the Aggro specialists known as the Stalkers, until such time as our own ranks fill great enough that we, the Bakshish, can fully assume the Responsibility of Going Forth... With Wisdom."</p> 
 
<p>There.  The die is cast.  What you have requested is paramount to Blasphemy.  Not only have you suggested a new Responsibility, one which was not set by your Ancestors, but also it is one which has so much overlap with an existing Responsibility that it could threaten its very meaning.  </p> 
<p>It is a wild request.  Brash.  Impetuous.  And also, completely necessary. Even the Esteemed must be capable of seeing that.  The events of the last years prove it utterly.</p> 
<p>Now, you have simultaneously forced her hand, and given her an out.  If she refuses-</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">"First, I am disappointed in you.  While I am aware that your youth makes you more prone to such inappropriate, and unwarranted, statements as to malign the performance of our Honored Aggro, I would have hoped that your station and title would have indicated a maturity to place you above such.  I wish I could claim that this was the first time I have been so disappointed by your behavior.  Your casual disregard for propriety and tradition has become overt as of late.  As for your Request, it is-"</p> 

<p id="First">"<i>Esteemed Elpahka</i>, <i>before you speak, I would have you know that if my words seem inappropriate, it is not because of my failings, but because of y- because of these times!  Please, for the sake of all of us, for the sake of our Ancestors Legacy, please hear me!</i>"</p> 
<p>Your pulse pounds in your head.  You can barely hear your thoughts over it.  You struggle to reign in your tongue.</p> 

<p id="First">"Esteemed, if you see naught but disrespect in my words, then I implore you to look deeper! I do not state such things to be hurtful, or cruel, or whatever playard antic you may think me capable of when you gaze upon me and see only my youth!  Esteemed, honored Wisdom, we need only look to the present to see the truth of the matter!  <i>Change is upon us!</i>  It is damnable, it is accursed, but it is now inescapable!  Elpahka, even you yourself suggested not long ago that we would have to look to the exterior for our solutions!  At the time, I did not see that wisdom.  But I cannot, <i>we cannot</i>, deny the truth of what we have ourselves witnessed!  </p> 
<p id="First">In our Ancestors time, their chief concern was to protect all of those who Walk the Path from the ravages and predations of the Exterior.  It is for this reason that Going Forth was to be the Responsibility of those most capable of enduring hardship and strife!  But to <i>learn</i> from the Outside?  To study it, uncover its secrets, and find its hidden dangers?  Dangers like The Blight?  That requires more than hardy frame! It requires cleverness, scrutiny, meticulousness! It requires <i>Bakshish</i>!"</p> 
 
<p>Oh fuck.  Oh fuck.  You're losing it.  Whatever combination of adrenaline and panacea that enabled you to be so brave as to <i>interrupt the Esteemed</i> <i>mid sentence</i> is failing you.  You can feel yourself petering out.  Time to double down.</p> 

<p id="First">"Esteemed Elpahka, I request of you, I beg of you, if it is the impropriety of my request, or the youth of the one who delivered it, that is giving you pause, then I ask that you please analyze your own words!  Youth does not preclude wisdom!  Truth is not always polite!  The World in which we find ourselves is harsh, vicious, and far more cruel than I could ever hope to be.  My words are merely a reflection of that fundamental cruelty.  If that reflection disturbs you, then please understand; you will do nothing to change a reality by asking the mirror to alter itself. You will only succeed in warping your own perception."</p> 
 
<p>Aand that's it.  You're done.  Probably in more ways than one.  If there's anyone here who didn't already have good reason to hate your guts, then you've certainly given them plenty of reason now.  But <i>fuck them. </i> <i>Fuck them and their stupid head-in-the-gravel stubborness.</i></p> 
<p>Just... fuck them all.  </p> 
<p>Ugh.  </p> 

<p>There's a prolonged silence.  </p> 
<p>Someone coughs.  Hacks, really.</p> 
<p>To your shock, it's none other than the Esteemed.</p> 
<p>Never, in your whole life, have you ever seen her do so.</p> 
<p>And you are not the only one rattled by such an open display of... of infirmity.</p> 

<p>She recovers quickly.  Her voice, when it starts, is just as strong as ever.  Perhaps even moreso- forcefully so.</p> 
<p id="Esteemed">"...First, I see no further reason to comment on the nature of your words and request.  I believe more than enough time has been spent on it. However, there is abundant wisdom in your quote.  It is easy to mistake what we See for Reality."</p> 

<p>-Quote?  You were just kind of spitballing there.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">"I will note, however, that a great deal of time could have been saved had you merely controlled yourself.  As I was prepared to state, your Request does bear some consideration.  These are uncertain times.  Already, we have been forced to find Paths where previously, we would expect none.  However, such steps must always be done with careful consideration and forethought.  I will place due diligent thought towards it before informing you of my decision.</p> 
<p id="Esteemed">For now, I ask that we place aside all theatrics.  Answer simply.  Do you believe we know how to resolve our current issues with the Blight?"</p> 

<p id="First">"...Yes.  We have found a solution that seems to work."</p> 
 
<p id="Esteemed">"And, having accounted for this resolution, will we be able to resume our normal operations in Agriculture?"</p> 

<p id="First">"...If we proceed with utmost care, and continue to exploit our... externally obtained nutrition sources in the short term, then yes.  We should be able to resume normal operations within the year."</p> 
 
<p id="Esteemed">"Excellent.  That was all that we required to hear.  Thank you, First Among Scholars."</p> 

<p>Exhausted, you surrender to the ritual.  You find an empty spot in the semicircle of standing Wisdom, and take your place in it.  You ignore the stares you get as you do so.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">"Assembled Wisdom, the purpose of this assembly was not to dwell overmuch on our Present, but instead, to look to the Future of our people.  Though our trials and tribulations have been great, you have heard from the words of those knowledgeable that they are... for the most part... under control, or concluded.  And as such, the question lies of to where all Crag should currently focus our attention.  I believe that the answer has become evident.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">You will all know that recently, an effort was made by those of us within the Elpahka to do all that we were capable of to see to the needs of all the people of Eschaton.  I, myself, was among those who did so, speaking among all the Bloodlines, Seeing them, Hearing them, Knowing them.  In those efforts, I saw a great many things;  Want, Resilience, Pain, Endurance, Despair, Resolve.  I saw sharp minds, strong bodies, and wise souls, all working in harmony to ensure our survival, to ensure our continuation, to ensure our Journey along the Path will continue forward until we reach our hallowed Destination."</p> 

<p>"No theatrics," she said.  Typical.  Ancestors forbid anyone should manage to talk more than her during one of these assemblies.  </p> 

<p id="Esteemed">"But, for all that I was encouraged by what I saw, I could not help but feel that something was missing.  Something equally important to our survival.  Something that has been, whether by necessity or mere inattentiveness, forgotten.</p> 
<p id="Esteemed">I saw little of Youth."</p> 

<p>That catches the attention of everyone in the room, yourself included.  Looks like she found the one topic that could distract them from focusing on your fatigue.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">"The Extermination, the Loss of <i>The Tome</i >, the Blight; all these troubles and more have disrupted our normal way of things.  It is understandable.  In particular, the Loss of <i>The Tome</i> means that every step we take now must be carefully considered, and executed with utmost precision.  Because of this need for caution, it is only wise that we would hesitate when pursuing the single most important thing that we must do, that our Ancestors had done, and which all who came before us, all the way to the First Generation, have conducted with the utmost sanctity and care.  After all, without <i>The Tome</i>, the chances for mistakes, for <i>Missteps</i>, are altogether far too great.  Though such caution is warranted, we must not allow ourselves to fall completely to inaction because of it.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">The time has now come.  Through the Strength of the Aggro, we have survived every attempt that the <span class="animal">Animals</span> levied against us during the Extermination.  Through the work of the Onagi, we have begun to rebuild from the devastation they brought upon us, and more than rebuild, we must grow, to bring Eschaton back to the grand heights which it once occupied.  Through the diligence of the Bakshish, we have now survived The Blight, and furthermore, we have already managed to recover writings long thought lost- a seed by which we may attempt to recover all which we need to know to restore our future, to Rebuild the Path, and thus continue boldly towards our Hallowed Destination.  And it is through the Guidance of the Elpahka, and through the toil of the Samra, that all of your efforts will be brought to the ultimate goal of our people.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">Eschaton must grow.  Knowledge must be recovered, or even recreated.  Our fields must grow abundant once more, our people strong and hearty, our will and safety restored.  All of this must be made in preparation.</p> 

<p id="Esteemed">We must prepare for the Next Generation."</p> 

<p>In spite of yourself, you feel a swell of pride in your heart.  A swell of purpose.  A swell of Hope.</p> 
<p>For all that you've said against the old Crone, you'll admit this; she knows how to give Hope.</p> 
<hr>
<p>The powerful gale blows against your frame.  It crashes against you, buffets, pushes with all its might.  </p> 
<p>It feels good.  It feels like conflict.  Along your right side, it even feels like pain, that distant, echoing thrum which all Aggro consider an old, faithful companion.  You'll relish that pain while it lasts; it is the aftereffects of the tincture given to you to regrow the nerves within your once-ruined flesh.  </p> 
<p>When you first consumed that tincture, it felt like your entire side was on fire once more.  </p> 
<p>That pain was the highlight of your week.</p> 

<p>You are <b>Saltik</b>.  It has felt somewhat disingenuous of you to think of yourself as Echo of Blood recently.  It's an excellent title for an excellent fellow, a master of war and slaughter... not for someone who misunderstood the basics of prey-hunting in his arrogance.  Not someone who killed his own warriors.</p> 
<p>You would give almost anything to have another opportunity to prove that you deserve it.  Another fight.  Another war.  </p> 
<p>Thanks to the high winds, no clouds impede your sight; from this outcropping, far from Eschaton's walls, you can see the great expanse of the Lowlands stretching out beneath you. The greens, the yellows.</p> 
<p>The conspicuous patch of black.  </p> 
<p>Yet even now, so soon, the greens threaten to consume the black.  That fits the Lowlands Perfectly, you think.  A ravenous patch of Green, consuming everything.</p> 

<p id="Embebi">"Ah, so you can walk in the daylight!  I was beginning to worry that the fires had turned you into a gneissferatu."</p> 

<p>You roll your eyes, but still end up chuckling.  You glance over your shoulder at your sib.  </p> 
<p>Her face is bright, vibrant.  It's part of the reason you decided to meet her out here.  She looks so drab within the walls of Eschaton.  Out here, in her element, she seems so much more... alive.  The sight of her cocksure expression does more to lift your spirits than the pain ever did.</p> 

<p id="Echo">"Intensely amusing.  Perhaps you should have made Wit your Art, instead of Song.  I'll bet it only took you the whole of the day to craft that stinging barb."</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"I always aim to impress."</p> 
<p id="Echo">"When you deign to aim at all.  I feel compelled to remind you of your stunning display with those honey beets."</p> 
<p>Now it's her turn to roll her eyes.</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"You're never going to stop holding that one over me, are you?"</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Sib, I can do nothing but hold things over you."</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"Ugh, for one so tall, you are so attracted to low hanging fronds."</p> 
<p>That one gets a genuine bark of laughter from you.</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Okay, okay. Well parried.  Telling blow to you."</p> 
<p>That brings her smug back at full force.  Good.  Hopefully that confidence will put her in the right frame of mind.</p> 

<p id="Embebi">"... So, what's the sitrep?  Do we have new marching orders?"</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Neg.  What we have is a situation.  And a complicated one."</p> 
<p>She cocks her head to the side.  You shrug.</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Esteemed held an Assembly.  I waived off, claimed recovery.  Probably a good thing, all considered.</p> 
<p id="Echo">Apparently the First, insufferable little craglet he is, did everything in his power to besmirch us.  I suppose those rumors about his earlier opinions were true.  Not only that, but he made an enormous scene, demanding that the Responsibility of Going Forth to be handed over to the <i>Bakshish</i>, of all Bloodlines.  I say it is fortunate I was not there, for had I been, I may have finished the other half of the strangling I gave him before."</p> 
<p>You jest, of course.  Maybe.  Pondering on it, maybe not a jest.  Well, definitely jest about doing it at the Assembly.  That would be in poor taste.</p> 

<p id="Embebi">"... He said all that, quineg?  Curious.  I kenned he was a cranky cragling, but wouldn't have expected him to have the stone to try and call us out before the Assembly."</p> 
<p>You quirk an eyebrow at her.  That wasn't the response you expected.</p> 
<p id="Echo">"...Sib, did you understand?  He proposed to seize Going Forth from us.  Your particular purview, as a Stalker.  I even understand he suggested making you and yours into little more than tutors till his brain brigades were prepared to tromp into the unknown with pens at the ready!  How aren't you livid?"</p> 
<p>Her lips quirk into a bemused expression.</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"I suppose because it seems so... outlandish.  Makes me think there may be an element of exaggeration to it.  Let me guess- you sent Galfin in your place?"</p> 
<p id="Echo">"...Aff.  But what does that matter?  He is the chief of the Euclast.  He is named and titled.  It's an appropriate substitution."</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"Well, aff, but his Art is Drama.  He has a tendency to... overblow things.  I know The First has a reputation for being... crude, but I would hardly imagine him to 'do all in his power to besmirch'.  See, that phrase just rings of Drama.  I bet it was a direct quote."</p> 
<p>You sigh, a prolonged, dramatic expulsion.  With lungs like yours, you can make it last.</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Embebi, you're missing the important part.  What if the Esteemed considers his demand?  She has sided with him in the past, when she forced us to attach his pack of pen pushers on our expedition around the mountainside.  Don't you remember how much of an ox-tempered... petulant... ill-mannered... <i>invalid he was</i>?"</p> 
<p>Embebi's expression turns dark.  Second Hell.  Yes, you went too far.</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"I would hardly call him <i>that</i>, sib."</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Ack.  You spent more time dealing with his crying than I did.  What would <i>you</i> call him?"</p> 
<p>Embebi is quiet for a moment, staring over the vista.  Then, she gets that smug grin again.</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"I'd probably call him... Cute."</p> 
<p>Now it's your turn to look dark.</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Cute."</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"Aff.  Foul tempered, sure, but... he just really wanted to prove himself.  He reminded me a lot of Genjin, in sibclade?  Back then, he also was ox-headed, sour, had a big mouth, but you knew he cared; he just didn't know how to show it, Quiaff?"</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Well, that big mouth of his was what got him into trouble.  He caught a spear in it."</p> 

<p>Well, now you've killed the mood.  Good.  The conversation was getting away from you anyway.</p> 
<p>After a long pause, you restart it, more to the point.</p> 

<p id="Echo">"Sib, you could be right.  But the Esteemed's decisions of late have been... unpredictable.  Set free from the guidance of The Tome, she seems to think that no course of action is truly unthinkable.  The fact that the First could voice such a suggestion, or close to it, at all shows how lowly he holds the Aggro.  </p> 
<p id="Echo">Right now, your Stalkers are one of the few of the specialists who are still largely intact.  The Euclast are still recovering, the Saccrolith number a paltry dozen, many soon senret, none of the Phanerists still live, and the specialty may be lost... you and yours are currently the shining ristars of the Aggro, our sign to the other Bloodlines that we are still to be valued, to be respected, that we have <i>worth</i>.  We need you to prove that worth.  And I need you at my side.  Both in the field... and in Wisdom."</p> 
<p>She tenses up. </p> 
<p id="Embebi">"Sib.  You know I can't.  I'm not..."</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Neg, sib.  You are.  You deny it, but any who observes you can tell that you are more than worthy, more than capable.  I won't let you use that excuse any more."</p> 
<p>She sighs.  Hah.  Yours was better.</p> 
<p id="Embebi">"Okay.  Maybe.  But... I can't even begin to think of who I would challenge.  What gives me that right?  I may be skilled at loping through the lowlands, or a pretty good shot, but what good do those do me against one of true, proven skill?  And besides... all the ritual, the trials, the ceremony..."</p> 
<p id="Echo">"Yes, I've heard that excuse before, as well.  I know the truth of it, sib.  You are an enigmelf to many, but not to me.  It is not the difficulty in gaining it that stays you.  It is what duties would entail after that does.  It cannot be helped.  These are trying times.  I need every ally I can get, every voice I can leverage.  I need you to be one of them.</p> 

<p id="Echo">Your team was the one responsible for finding those Lost Crag in the Lowlands, Quiaff?  The ones who returned to us some measure of <i>The Tome</i>?  Much knowledge, nearly lost, was returned to us by your discovery.  As much as they may revile the Aggro, that fact cannot be disputed.  You were responsible.  And so, the senior Named and I have decided that you should be among those who benefit first from what was discovered.</p> 

<p id="Echo">Names, sib.  Names nearly lost.  Names that they nearly took from us, as none lived to pass them on, none lived to remember them.  But now they are found. They are Remembered.</p> 
<p id="Echo">Since none hold them, a new method for earning one has been devised.  A trial, created by the senior named and I, for each name.  Complete the trial, prove your worthiness, and the name will live once more, born again to be carried on.  And for you, sib... I think there's one that fits you quite well.</p> 

<p id="Echo">So, here's some marching orders for you, sib.  Take your Stalkers.  Return to the field.  Your discovery proves that there are Crag who survived the purges of the other settlements, who hide to this day in nooks and crannies.  Scour the mountainside.  Seek with passion.  Find more of our lost kin, and return with them.  Do so, and you will have earned your Bloodname.</p> 

<p id="Echo">Arcker, the Unbound."</p> 

<p>Hah.  Look at her face.  You knew that'd get her.</p> 
<hr>
<p>Ancestors, what a day.  Whataday whataday whataday.</p> 
<p>You are once more the <b>First</b>, and after that disaster of an assembly, you had to put in some time doing some more intimate one-on-ones with your various Heads.  Sure, you ruffled some feathers during the assembly, but with a little bit of finagling and discussion, each of them understand it wasn't <i>them</i>, particularly, that you had any issues with.  </p> 
<p>So, in short, you lied your fundament off.  No worries.  It's all for the greater good.</p> 
<p>By the time you stumble back into your personal office, the sun has nearly managed to dip beneath the horizon.  Using the last remnants of light, you manage to light your oil lantern, then spread it's guttering flame to a few choice candles set in strategic locations.  </p> 
<p>Of course, immediately after doing so, in preparation for another long night, well, burning the midnight oil, you suddenly realize just how <i>tired</i> you are.  Tensions ran high today.  A lot of harsh words were said.  A lot of intriguing proposals were made.  A lot of plans for the future were drawn.  Frankly, you're spent.</p> 

<p>You look over to your desk.  Those rubbings are still there.  You're not sure if there's really any more you can glean from them specifically; It's possible there were some clues that were missed in that old cavern, however.  And, moreover, there could be MORE of those little grotesque ritual chambers out there.  </p> 
<p>However, that's all guess and supposition right now.  Really, practically, all you can do is wait, and see if your suggestion you made takes root.  You still can't <i>believe</i> you actually had to stone to go through with that!  Sure, you had been imagining, perhaps even fantasizing, about being given free leave to explore all these fascinating surrounding climes, but it was only through a perverse mixture of liquid courage and rage that you actually <i>up and did it</i>.  </p> 
<p>And speaking of liquid things...</p> 
<p>The last two vials you prepared this morning sit on the small table next to your bed... a little nightcap, and then a little night-night.  </p> 
<p>What the first hell.  You did good today.  May as well reward yourself.</p> 
<p>You extinguish all but one of the candles you had <i>just</i> lit, but you don't let that get you down.  With anticipation, you slam back the penultimate potion for the evening,  take a comfortable position in your reading chair, and then you let the <i>universe unfold itself.</i></p> 
 
<p id="i">The Beauty.</p> 
<p id="i">The Vastness.</p> 
<p id="i"><b>The Colors</b>.</p> 

<p id="i">Ancestors, you needed this.  So much stress.  So many things to juggle.  So many people to piss off and please.  If only you could-</p> 

<p>There's a noise echoing in your mind.  A dull thud.  Repeated a few times over.</p> 
<p>You look around the room, blearily.  What is that?  Where is it coming from?</p> 
<p>You find the source.  Your door.  What?  What the third hell?</p> 
<p>The sound happens again.  Your door bulges inward.</p> 
<p>Someone is knocking?  Who?  What could be important this time of night?</p> 
<p>The thud again.  The bulge is more pronounced.</p> 
<p>...That's not knocking.</p> 

<p>You leap to your feet.  You don't know what's happening.  You scrabble for meaning while you scrabble for something else.  Something you think is important.</p> 

<p>Your door thuds, and bulges inward, before opening entirely.  It slams open, a blustery gale pushing it all the way in.  A massive looming figure fills the doorframe.  It also fills your heart with fear.</p> 
<p>Ancestors preserve you.  It's Echo.  He heard what you said today.  He's mad.</p> 
<p>You feel something, gripped in your hand.  The something important you were looking for.  It's the thing that Slabal made for you.  Made especially for you.</p> 
<p>The Kuthe.</p> 
<p>Echo advances into your room.  You can't read the expression on his face.  It's too dark.  You can't make out anything apart from his hands.  They grasp at the air, opening and closing.</p> 
<p>You try to back away.  There's nowhere to go.</p> 
<p>The massive hands reach out for you.  Instinctively, you swing whats in <i>your</i> hand.  You hear a ripping noise, like parchment tearing.  Crimson joins the panolpy of colors, staining everything.</p> 
<p>The hands don't stop.  You can't stop them.</p> 
<p>Your neck hurts.  It's being crushed! <i>You can't Breathe!</i></p> 
<p>You feel yourself lifted into the air.  Your legs kick.  Desperate to do something, you jab forward with your weapon.  Over and over again, it jabs into something both soft, and hard, at the same time.  Your nose is filled with the scent of iron.  Yet, you cannot inhale the scent; you cannot inhale!</p> 
<p>Redness and blackness tinge the color palette of the universe.  You were tired before, but it is nothing before this tiredness.  So overwhelming.  So complete.  Perhaps if you relax everything will be okay.</p> 
<p>Perhaps all the pain, the hurt, the frustration, the suffering will all end.</p> 
<p>You go limbs go slack.  You can't think anymore.  Your eyes close.  You fall...</p> 
<p>...back against your chair.  You whang your head against the backrest.</p> 
<p>Your eyes snap open.  You gasp for air, sucking it in, hungry for it, greedy for it.</p> 
<p>You cut your gaze around the room.  It's completely dark.  You can't see anything.</p> 
<p>Are you blind?<br>Are you dead?</p> 
<p>Light flashes.  Lightning, from the storm beneath you, dimly paints your room with illumination, before being followed by a rumble.</p> 
<p>The candle you had lit is out.  Blown out by the wind.<br>Your door swings inward.  Blustering gales push it against the wall again and again.  Thud.  Thud.  </p> 
<p>Carefully, as if afraid of waking the darkness, you try to raise to your feet.  You put your hands against the armrests.  You end up stabbing your favorite chair.</p> 
<p>You become aware of the Kuthe, trapped in a deathgrip in your hands.  You become aware of pain in your fingers.  You also become aware that, in spite of this pain, you have no desire to release the weapon.  </p> 
<p>Once again, you try to rise to your feet, with less stabbing.  With careful motions, you maneuver to your desk, fumbling for your sparking flint.  It's a bit difficult with one hand, but eventually, you manage to light your oil lamp.</p> 
<p>The guttering flame throws your dark room into relief.  Your scattered desk.  The kuthe scabbard on the floor.  Your door, still swinging, it's latch slightly warped, slipped from its catch.  The weapon in your hand.</p> 
<p>There's no blood on it.</p> 
<p>There's no blood anywhere.</p> 
<p>You reach for your neck, stop, then reach for your neck with your free hand.</p> 
<p>It hurts.  Kind of.  You're pretty sure, anyway.  That's pain, right?</p> 
<p>You look at your chair.  It's been stabbed.  Someone stabbed your chair.  Wait, you were that someone.</p> 

<p>The thudding gets to you.  You move to your door, and with some effort, manage to push it closed.  The latch is easily bent back into shape.  It still thuds against the blustering winds.</p> 

<p>You lean against the door, making sure it's held shut, and then slowly, suredly, you slip to the floor, boneless, energyless.</p> 

<p>...You thought they were supposed to be <i>pleasant</i> hallucinations.</p> 
<p>A furious wind bangs against your door.  It promises retribution.</p>

<h2>New Developments</h2>
<h3>The Next Generation</h3>
<p>Of all of the Crag's Rituals and Traditions, few are more precious, more sacrosanct, than the announcement of a Next Generation.  It is the fundamental purpose of the Path, to find a way by which careful selection and concentration of traits may allow the rise of the Perfect Elf, free from infirmity, pain, or foolishness.  However, in the wake of the loss of The Tome, and all the trials which followed it, these preparations were halted, put aside for more immediate concerns.  However, it is the wisdom of the Esteemed Elpahka that such concerns have largely passed, and that now they must do everything in their power to begin to prepare once more for this nigh-sacred procedure.</p> 
<p>In order to prepare for this development, numerous tasks must be completed.  In particular:</p> 
<ol>
    <li>A Settlement, preferably Eschaton, must be grown to at least Town size, in order to accommodate the new population, and the rebuilt infrastructure required to handle the Next Generation.</li>
    <li>All Tracks must be free from any stress, and ideally remain so for a full year.</li>
    <li>Due to the recent food troubles suffered by the Crag people, a permanent foodsource capable of supporting all the Crag, but separate from the Farmlands of Eschaton, must be established, in order to ensure full confidence that a Blight situation will not happen again.</li>
    <li>Most importantly, and most complicated, the currently available traits of the Crag people must be compiled, analyzed, and considered, to determine the best way to make progress towards the Hallowed Destination.  This task, in particular, is best assisted by making progress towards rebuilding or recreating <i>The Tome</i>, as its essential instruction into the needed traits for this generation is vital for ensuring proper results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Should all of these conditions be met, it will be the responsibility of the Elpahka to consider the results, and determine whether or not the time is truly right to begin the Next Generation.</p> 
<h3>Who Shall Go Forth</h3>
<p id="i">The First's arguments that the task of Going Forth should belong to those with greater capability for careful record-keeping has merited some approval.  However, the Aggro and their Stalkers have no intention to relinquish this ancient Responsibility freely.  Depending on how each bloodline performs in this task, the Aggro may yet retain the responsibility... or see it claimed by the Bakshsish.</p>
<p>This Development will track attempts by both bloodlines to explore and understand this new World.  Whomever manages to demonstrate their ability will retain or gain the Responsibility.</p> 
<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic</b>: <i>While the Onagi are eager to contribute to the growth of Eschaton, it is the thoughtful consideration of the greatest of their number, the Layer of the Path, that they should probably finish their current project before moving to a new one.  Outpost Eparchy was created with the intention to extract, purify, and ultimately trade raw materials for useful succor; a practice which she sees little reason to abandon, considering that starvation is still a very real threat.</i></p> 
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Infrastructure(Investment)</b> skill to grant the aspect <i>Pumping Iron</i> to Outpost Eparchy, representing the outpost's fundamental concern as an extractor of raw minerals.</p> 
<p><b>Political</b>: <i>Heeding the words of the greatest of their number, the Esteemed, the Elpahka set about directly towards fulfilling their requirements towards preparing the people for the Next Generation.  The fact that this is likely the same thing that they would have been doing in the wake of the blight is just a coincidence, they swear.  In any case, the foremost concern of all is to restore the faith of the Crag People; In due consideration, the wisest way to do so is to simply give them an opportunity to Rest.  Duties are relaxed, toils rescheduled, and reserves dipped into to allow the Samra to recover their strength.</i></p> 
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Recovery(Leadership)</b> Skill to move two points of stress from the Morale Track onto the Economic track, representing the use of stored(nonfood) resources while giving the exhausted, spent Samra an opportunity to relax.  At the same time, they will also attempt to remove one of these two points (total Difficulty 3).</p> 
<p><b>Military:</b> <i>Eager to prove their abilities, and perhaps be fortunate enough to find some more remnants of lost Crag lore, Embebi and her Stalkers are making a circuit of the Mountainous Terrain surrounding Eschaton.  The Greatest of their number, the Echo of Blood, continues to generally sulk in his room as the wounds of both himself and the Euclast mend.</i></p> 
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Reconaissance(Pathfinders)</b> skill to explore two mountainous squares </span><span>(route marked in easy-to-read-against-red-background red</span><span>).  As the terrain is mostly mountainous, the stunt <i>The Stone is our Home</i> is applied. Additionally, as they are attempting to find lost remnants of their history among the crags and summits, Embebi will spend a fate point to Invoke the aspect <b>Our Legacy is Set in Stone</b> to provide an additional Proficiency Die.</p> 
<p><b>Mental:</b><i> Coincidentally mirroring the actions of the Onagi, while the Bakshish are eager to begin the work of collating Traits and Bloodlines needed for the Next Generation, the greatest of their number, the First Among Scholars, harasses and harrangues several of them who previously traveled with the Stalkers.  Investigating the already mapped lands to the East, where Outpost Eparchy was founded, they insist they are investigating some additional deposits, while in reality, they are clandestinely researching the cave in which the gruesome, hobgoblin-fueled ritual was found.  Perhaps it will provide some insight into the origins of the Blight, or perhaps an entirely different threat to Eschaton...</i></p> 
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Unknown(Research)</b> skill to investigate the nature and potential consequences of the odd ritual found in the Eastern cave. As it is currently uncertain whether the ritual is more Arcane, Mystic, or Spiritual, they will instead work on the fly; They'll roll one Ability dice they would have should it be something other than Mystical, and let that stand as the result. In a worst case scenario, this preliminary research will let them know which field is most appropriate to focus their efforts in the future.</p> 
<h4>End of Turn</h4> 
<h2>Results</h2> 
<p><b>Economic</b> - You have successfully added the Aspect <i>Pumping Iron </i>to Eparchy! In fact, building the outpost into a mining settlement is damn near relaxing for the Onagi after all the absolutely crazy things they have been asked to build lately. This is a path well trod, for once.</p> 

<p>The Onagi prepare Eparchy for extraction duties with room to spare, ahead of schedule, and under budget. Due to their success, the first use of this Aspect will also get a boost die, no matter when it happens.</p> 

<p><b>Political - </b>Once again, the Elpahka prove their wisdom and their worth in their pursuit of keeping the hearts and souls of the crag intact. The First probably would have been furious at such an expenditure of precious resources when the margins are still so thin and so dependent on outside forces, but the Elpahka are confident in their decision and he's busy.</p> 

<p>Most importantly, they turn out to be right. While history and the Tome will record the drama and effort of the other castes' efforts to fight the blight, it was the steady effort of the Samra that kept Eschaton from being a group of wise elves dispensing orders at corpses and rocks. They have toiled and suffered in silence this whole time, with no idea what was happening above them or if their next season would be their last. Their suffering was so great that it was immediately apparent to even the Seeker over a year ago. Since then, it had only gotten worse.</p> 

<p>Many of the Samra were skin and bone, having withstood suffering that would have broken even the vile power of an <span class="animal">Animal</span>. The Elpahka's decision to lift the burden on them for a time, to allow them to rest and recover, may end up being a critical one for the future.</p> 

<p>They are allowed to rest and recover, to regain their strength, to recover from sickness and despair, to spend time with their families and have time to properly mourn their dead. This respite is a gift that will not be forgotten.</p> 

<p>Not only did you perform all of the Recovery actions planned, but the Samra return to work with renewed effort, vigor, and even contentment. Whichever action next turn best represents the actions of the common Samra gets an <b>upgrade.</b></p> 

<p><b>Military - </b> With the weight of both the future of the Tome and of the Aggro on her shoulders, Embebi rises to the challenge. Moreso, she does this in true crag fashion. If the last year has taught her anything, it's that while flashes of dramatic heroism are great, the crag's greatest strength is in the slow and steady path. She applies this to her newfound goal of demonstrating the worth of the Aggro through her pathfinders. The Tome will not be found in a season and she plans accordingly.</p> 

<p>Instead of the all-in expeditions of the past year, Embebi focuses her efforts on preparing her pathfinders for years to come of searching some of the most dangerous terrain the world has to offer. Another disaster like the burning of the lowlands cannot happen. After speaking to Saltik and seeing how low he has been brought, she understands the hubris that led the Aggro to that tragedy and is determined that it won't happen again. Her steadfast leadership and stony determination are an inspiration to many floundering crag. She will make this work, no matter how long this takes.</p> 

<p>Which is good because you don't find much in those two squares. They both have the <i>Mountains </i>and <i>Treacherous Highlands </i>Aspects, but not much else. Still, her slow and steady approach means there were no injuries in exploring the dangerous terrain. In addition, they find discarded Crag equipment and supplies in this area that prove some of the crag who fled the purges went higher into the mountains. Rangers might be able to determine a specific path these refugees took, but they might not. Either way, they have proof they are on the right track.</p> 

<p>While you don't get any specific bonuses, Embebi's approach to leadership will reduce the chances of fatalities with further pathfinding.</p> 

<p><b>Mental</b> - Come to naught. Wasted. <i>Purged.</i> Combined with <i>Sacrificed to Luna.</i> You don't sacrifice without a purpose. It's literally in the definition. It has to be significant. It <i>has </i>to be. The First knows well that there is no limit to the depravities that the <span class="animal">Animals</span> are capable of, and worse their twisted minds can come up with quite devious and subtle plans. The timing is too convenient, as is the location. It's barely more than a day's walk from Eschaton. It <i>cannot</i> be a coincidence.</p> 

<p>The First recruits the Bakshish that know the most about <span class="animal">Animal</span> depravity. Those that he can trust, as well as those that he knows he can bully into silence. He successfully passes off his actions as a further mineral surveys, camping his research team in Eparchy and seeking out the cave.</p> 

<p>The first survey team left as soon as they realized what the place contained and wrote a basic report. It has not been touched since, not even by scavengers. The dry mountain air has preserved the bodies somewhat, as well as the scene.</p> 

<p>The ritual must have been a violent one, and the participants unaware and unwilling. They appear to have been attacked in the night. The hobgoblins were soldiers, but some of them didn't have time to don their armor. Some may have even been killed before they got out of their bedrolls. Whatever group did this, they were interested in killing these hobgoblins with ruthless and brutal efficiency, with as much mercy as sadism - none of either. Total war, total slaughter. No survivors. Typical of <span class="animal">Animals</span>.</p> 

<p>The First is more interested in what happened after the deaths. The hobgoblins appear to have been dead when beheaded and branded. <span class="animal">Animals </span>never do things like that without a purpose. It was clear ritualistic intent. The First and his team analyze every possible detail they can think of - the positioning of the bodies, the stacking of the heads, the spacing of the blood patterns, the order in which they were killed. He leaves out no detail, takes no chances. Infuriatingly, he finds precious little trace magic. If it started the blight it was some time ago. They could have covered their tracks. He persists. He won't underestimate them. Not this time.</p> 

<p>The Bakshish try every avenue of research available to them, from researching the foul religious practices of the <span class="animal">Animals</span> to the known ways they have used magic in warfare. The cruel details of their purges. The details of their disgusting beliefs and how they might apply to a ritual like this. The First pours through every text available about the runes for weeks to find some connection. Meditations in the chamber, both alchemically enhanced and otherwise.</p> 

<p>As winter falls and the cave grows frigid, they are no closer to understanding any of it. There is no reference anywhere to a ritual like this or that combination of runes, and more esoteric methods of pursuing knowledge only muddy the waters. This ritual seems random, but it <i>can't </i>be. <span class="animal">Animals</span> don't do things like this at random. Unless it's the work of the insane? Some mad group of beasts wandering the land? Some idiot lowlander trying to mimic their former masters? Maybe some lost group of pathetic and depraved slaves trying to summon their masters back like they were some kind of spiritual beings? A horrifying prank?</p> 

<p>Increasingly frustrated, the First decides to look into <i>how</i> the brands were made. Maybe the symbols themselves didn't fuel the ritual, maybe the process of creating the symbols <i>was </i>the ritual. Sure enough, his examination determines that there is an extremely faint magical aura in the symbols themselves.</p> 

<p>The First spends an inordinate amount of personal resources pursuing this. Despite the insistence of Bakshish casters that the lingering aura is too faint to learn anything from, he does not give up. He pours his entire intellect into this. Every obscure formulae he knows, every reagent he can find to amplify the faint aura, every mind-bending concoction he can imbibe at once, until he can hear colors, see magic, and feel time. Through his drug-fueled haze in the cave, he can see a faint white shape cutting down other faint black shapes. The white shape huddles over the fallen black shapes and in his muddied mind the First sees the cursed runes glow faintly with magic on the fallen. Across time and space, he focuses the remaining fragments of his rational mind on deciphering the origins of the spell. Against all odds, inspiration strikes and the First completes the impossible task of learning the magical origins of the runes.</p> 

<p>It's an orison.</p> 

<p>A <i>fucking </i> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/brand&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1576733988098000">orison.</a></p> 

<p>I mean there's something off there because wow that's a specific spell, and hey that narrows down the possibilities of who could have - the First is unable to make any kind of excuse for how useless this has been. A howl of inarticulate frustration echoes through Eparchy.</p> 

<p>You are no closer to understanding the purpose or origins of this ritual, only that the most powerful magic used in performing it was a freaking 0th level spell and not some nation scale ritual.</p>
