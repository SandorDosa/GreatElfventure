<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You are&hellip; Shit. &nbsp;No, wait, you aren&rsquo;t shit. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re just&hellip; who the fuck are you again? &nbsp;Hang on, let&rsquo;s go through the checklist.</span></p>
<ol class="c19 lst-kix_zf4sdwv6y44s-0 start" start="1"><li class="c6 c20"><span class="c2">You immediately started thinking in a checklist. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re probably a pretty organized guy.</span></li><li class="c6 c20"><span class="c2">Fuck you. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re also a pretty rude guy, you guess.</span></li><li class="c6 c20"><span class="c2">You&rsquo;re a guy, at least you&rsquo;re pretty sure you are, so that cuts your options down for who you are significantly.</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">Based on these three factors alone, you&rsquo;re about 90% confident that you are </span><span class="c16 c12">Renyan</span><span class="c2">, that guy who others think is so smart they named him the first one to have to deal with this oxshit.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Oh judgemental ancestors, it&rsquo;s coming back to you now. &nbsp;Yes, you are the First Among Scholars&hellip; huh, it doesn&rsquo;t bold when you&rsquo;ve already been identified&hellip; and you have been having a really weird, uh, last three months.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Lots of discoveries there. &nbsp;Lots of ups and downs. &nbsp;Probably the biggest down was when you were about to suggest selectively culling the population, and then that big&hellip; big&hellip; biggy bigelf went and took all of that courage you were mustering up and threw it directly off the mountain, upstaging you at the part where you were going to turn history.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">That was pretty bad. &nbsp;Yep. &nbsp;Pretty bad.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">But then there was the weird bit that when the Aggro started actually doing that thing they said they would do, they actually put in some effort to scope the place properly, and inadvertently totally validated your theory that the lowlands could have exploitable agriculture land. &nbsp;If only someone competent had been sent the first time around, a lot of shit around here would be pretty different. &nbsp;That was&hellip; kinda good? &nbsp;In an I-Told-You-So sort of way? Of course, then they started ripping it to shreds. &nbsp;Not great.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">But then, thinking of agriculture, after that display, the heads pretty much totally ignored your plan to make new dirt. &nbsp;Instead, they kept following up on the things they were doing. &nbsp;It was pretty bad that you got ignored, you took that one kind of hard, but really, that was a net positive all things considered; they not only totally validated your theories- yes, you were 100% correct, even pretty much about the pad-time needed- they also got motivated to figure out ways to make it go faster, AND even, on their own initiative, worked with the Samra and Onagi to make more of those quartz...things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s Really a plus, because those sad sacks of shit weren&rsquo;t doing </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">anything</span><span class="c16 c18">&nbsp;before you whipped them into action, so you can pretty much take credit for this new burst of energy! </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">Nice</span><span class="c2">! &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">Although, speaking of the Onagi, then there&rsquo;s the fact that the Layer of the Path, who you really wanted to try to coordinate with for your soil-making plan, just kind of...disappeared. &nbsp;Which had you really stressed out for a lot of reasons that are difficult to articulate, especially right now. &nbsp;You were pretty sure she wasn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">definitely</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;dead, since when you actually broke down and asked the old crone about it, she said not to concern yourself and to tend to your own tasks, which probably at least meant she knew what was going on. &nbsp;Still, given her track record of late, that tidbit was a pretty strong down force through the season.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">But hey, at least progress was being made! &nbsp;So as long as the Aggro kept bringing in the food, you could keep the fields fallow, let the Blight die off, and then everything would be back to normal!</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s when they set the entire world on fire.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Or, at least, it kind of seemed like it. &nbsp;The smoke was so big and high you could see it from your workplace. &nbsp;That was a pretty bad week. &nbsp;Without that supply of food, the whole fallow plan was pretty screwed. &nbsp;It would even be too late for your original plan. &nbsp;That was kind of a combined &ldquo;aw shit&rdquo; and &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, so really mixed bag.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">And then the mixed bags arrived. &nbsp;Whoo boy.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">The Layer of the Path came back! +<br>She brought an absurd amount of food! ++<br>The food came from Lowlander elves. --</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Who she pretty much had to tell about Eschaton.---<br>And probably where it&rsquo;s located.----</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">And the whole thing was the Esteemed&rsquo;s idea, so basically her farsighted wisdom saved the day.------------</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Probably while dooming you all. +?</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s when you decided to...</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;consult the Spirits of the Ancients.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Well, one ancient in particular. &nbsp;Sivens. &nbsp;Tedious shit that he was, he still gave you a stoppered decanter of fermented&hellip; something&hellip; the first time you tried to take the Elemat Bloodname from him. &nbsp;And failed. A consolation prize. &nbsp;You preferred to use it as your Totem of Unbridled Ire. &nbsp;The inherent patronizing nature of it kept you studying and honing your mind long into the nights. &nbsp;He certainly didn&rsquo;t give you one the next time you invoked Bloodrite. In fact, you never saw him again. &nbsp;You heard a building fell on him. &nbsp;It sort of disappointed you that his death wasn&rsquo;t ironic in any way.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">That decanter&rsquo;s empty now. &nbsp; Since the whole world was going mad, it just made sense to join them the best way you could.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">...You really do have to say, for a guy with what is probably a splitting hangover, you&rsquo;re holding up pretty well on the cognition front. &nbsp;Wait. Do you actually have a hangover?</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You crack open an eye. &nbsp;The sun is bright, check that, ow, but not really causing any splitting headache. &nbsp;How&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You open both your eyes- looking to the side this time, clever you- and rediscover what you&rsquo;ve been rediscovering for, by your estimate, the last week worth of mornings in a row.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">A collection of vials, four of them empty, one full, labeled </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">Drink this</span><span class="c16 c18">. &nbsp;In smaller text beneath, </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">No, really.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Sivens&rsquo; final lesson, tucked in small scroll at the bottom of the decanter. &nbsp;Probably intended to keep you from challenging him again, considering the consequences, although you bet he wasn&rsquo;t planning for you to almost choke to death on it.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">&nbsp; A simple little alchemical formula for something whimsically called a </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">Polypurpose Panacea</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You grab the vial of pink viscous liquid and hammer it back, muscle memory knowing what your state-dependent doesn&rsquo;t. </span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18 c5">Time to get shit done.</span></p>
<hr><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">The expanse of Eschaton sweeps beneath you. &nbsp;From here, even the Pagoda of the Esteemed is beneath your gaze. &nbsp;You had discovered this particular outcropping as a youth, and visited it frequently; the panorama it provided always seemed to calm you. &nbsp;Even from here, the boundaries of the Greatest of the Crag settlements cannot be taken in a single eyeful. When you are younger, the sight of it filled you with calm and awe.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">Now, having traversed the Floor of the World, the great expanse of the Lowlands, and all the mysterious dangers that lurk within, all you can think of is how </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">boring </span><span class="c2">it is. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Speaking of boring, you figure now is as good a time as any for repast. &nbsp;While still perched and observing, you deftly fish into your sidepouch, pulling forth another curious gift of the Lowlands. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">To your understanding, the tuber was called a &lsquo;Potato&rsquo;. &nbsp;There was some disagreement as to whether that was </span><span class="c16 c18">po-tah-to or po-tay-to</span><span class="c2">, but what could not be disagreed with was it&rsquo;s utility as a marching ration. &nbsp;You&rsquo;d estimate that one of these brown spheroids contained as much packed energy and nutrition as any cliff rye cracker, if not moreso.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You bite into the thick root with a resounding crunch.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">Shame about the taste, though.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">As you chew, you consider your next course of action carefully. &nbsp;You observe your next destination, your next target, with keen eyes, trying to imagine the sequence of events to follow. &nbsp;With practiced stillness, ingrained from over a hundred successful hunts, you tend to the needs of your flesh while your mind is free to plan, to prepare, and to foresee. Through this talent, one of the chief skills in a Stalker&rsquo;s retinue, you can determine one thing with utmost surety.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You are stalling.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">You are </span><span class="c16 c12">Embebi</span><span class="c16 c18">, and if you&rsquo;re being honest with yourself, you&rsquo;ve kind of been stalling for nearly the past week. &nbsp;When you returned to Eschaton from the Esteemed&rsquo;s bizzare, but not totally unwelcome, mission into the depths of the Lowlands, you were almost- </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">almost</span><span class="c16 c18">, not actually, but </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">almost</span><span class="c2">- grateful for the disaster which had struck in your absence. &nbsp;Searching the burnt fields, checking every crevice and cranny for signs of life, had kept you occupied for days, allowing you to ignore the unpleasant conversation you had been&hellip; dreading is the wrong word, but you can&rsquo;t really think of a better one in its place. &nbsp;But now, with the survivors (or otherwise) found, there is nothing left to excuse you. &nbsp;You know what you have to do.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You sigh, openly. &nbsp;Such brooding isn&rsquo;t like you. You hadn&rsquo;t been-</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Wait a moment. &nbsp;You were about to brood about brooding.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Okay, time to nip this in the bud. &nbsp;You jam the rest of the tuber into your mouth, working at it as you hop down from your perch. &nbsp;Steady hands and strong jaws work in parallel, and before long, you drop back onto one of the crumbled walls of Eschaton. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">The trip to the Great Circle is a short one, but still manages to be unpleasant. &nbsp;Not just for the signs of deprivation and weary that still strike the Crag, there&rsquo;s also the simple fact that, for some reason, ever since the Extermination you have been&hellip; increasingly uncomfortable in confined spaces. &nbsp;Compared to the unbroken horizon of the Lower Plains, to have your sight constrained by artifice and construction just feels&hellip; well&hellip; constricting. &nbsp;However, as you finally walk into the familiar halls, such confinement gives way to pleasant nostalgia. Eschaton may be home to all Crag, but the Circle is Home to the Aggro.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">The door before you is thick, set with iron bands, and you throw it open before you have any more opportunity to wax poetic about the deep seated portent behind it or whatever. &nbsp;However, your rapid entry leaves you unprepared for what you see.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Echo of Blood, hugest of all the Aggro, sits in the dark, a single guttering candle lighting his personal quarters. &nbsp;Reflected in candlelight, you can see the bare flesh of his arms and chest, angry, red, warped and twisted. &nbsp;His right side, from his hand to his pectoral, is just one massive burn, blistered, blackened, the flesh even seeming to run in some places. &nbsp;Though bandaged in some places, most of the damage has been left exposed to the mountain air. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">In spite of yourself, you gasp.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">If Echo&hellip; if Saltik&hellip; takes any offense at your shock, he shows no signs of it. &nbsp;Though seated on his bed, his andesite eyes are nearly level with yours, and all you can see in them is weariness. &nbsp;That, in and of itself, is more shocking than the wounds.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Finally, he chuckles, a low, grinding rumble.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c12 c23">&ldquo;Close the door, Embebi. &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t your cladekeeper teach you better?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">A soft smile settles on your face, and you chuckle alongside him, doing as he asks. &nbsp;Looking to overcome the initial awkwardness, you seek out his guest stool and kick it over to yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting so long, sib. &nbsp;A lot of cleanup work to do down there. &nbsp;Ox before the cart, aff?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">He says nothing, but you can feel some of his jocularity worn away. &nbsp;Right. &nbsp;Bad topic.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;...Okay. &nbsp;So. &nbsp;Sitrep. Aar recon. Targs lowelf-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Echo holds up his left hand. &nbsp; Though still burned, it is not nearly the mass of cauterized flesh his right is. </span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">&ldquo;Keep it civil, sib. &nbsp;Details, not speed. &nbsp;Start with broad strokes. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll fill in from there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;Aff. &nbsp; Alright, starting from the beginning. &nbsp;You know the basics of the mission origin; Lowlander comes here, manages to see the Esteemed Elpahka, she manages to get some geoloc- some lowlander settlement locations off of the Lowlander, and then, for some reason, lets her go. &nbsp;By the way, I can partially confirm the other location we got; it looks like a separate&hellip; Tribe? Type? &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go with type, of Elf lives there too. &nbsp;Kind of close, for my tastes.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">Anyway. &nbsp;Journey was mostly nonsit. We arrive at the chosen encampment; it looks like the residents there, &ldquo;Blade Elves&rdquo;... you remember them&hellip; either claimed or constructed a sizeable fortification there. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s decent work for those without will. &nbsp;Crackable, but it&rsquo;d take a bit. &nbsp;Not that I think we&rsquo;ll need to. &nbsp;So far, they seem pretty content to remain there; they&rsquo;ve got an abundance of arable land, and do not want for nutrition- hence, all the &lsquo;potatoes&rsquo;, but the details on that come later.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c26 c12">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry overmuch reporting on disposition yet. &nbsp;If we do need to engage, we would need more recent information in any case. &nbsp;</span><span class="c26 c5 c12">Broad</span><span class="c23 c12">&nbsp;sweeps, sib.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;Aff. Okay, broader. &nbsp;We reached the settlement. &nbsp;They informed us that they were hosting some kind of&hellip; they called it a &lsquo;pot-luck&rsquo;. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no equivalent translation. &nbsp;Best comparison, various Elftype representatives come, give an offering of food to the hosts, and in return have an opportunity to interact with all of the other Elftypes. &nbsp;It seemed an extremely&hellip; informal arrangement. &nbsp;There were some perfunctory attempts at ritual, but it was mostly just a guideless scrum.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">While there, I had the opportunity to observe some odd conduct, but nothing that particularly stood out as an immediate existential threat to Eschaton, or it&rsquo;s secrecy. &nbsp;The Layer, for her part, seemed to understand opsec enough to not blab that. Although&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Fourth hell, this is the part you were&hellip; again, dreading was wrong. &nbsp;Anticipated being embarrassing? </span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You sigh. Saltik raises one of his bushy eyebrows.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;...I cannot claim to have witnessed her actions the whole time. &nbsp;I made a mistake. &nbsp;I can explain it, but it will require further details. &nbsp;They could be relevant to our current situation, at least?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">He says nothing. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;...During the event, I witnessed at least one attempt at Ritual that seemed sincere, though crude. &nbsp;A representative from an Elftype who call themselves the &ldquo;Fire Elves&rdquo; arrived, bearing challenge. &nbsp;She bore the Epithet &ldquo;Ashwalker&rdquo;, and challenged what seemed to be a Blade senret. &nbsp;Evidently, the trial was &lsquo;over the honor of their schools.&rsquo; &nbsp;Best guess, she was attempting to establish superiority of a fighting style? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s how she explained it to me, anyway. &nbsp;Err, she, being the Ashwalker. &nbsp;<br>The challenge was clumsy. &nbsp;Though there were declared Stakes, there was no Bid, and none moved to form a Circle of Equals. &nbsp;I did, of course, and so I actually observed what happened. &nbsp;Because there was no bid, both fought with full arm, but Ashwalker brought only her wholesome self, while the senret&hellip; Ehra, Holder of the ...something&hellip; Bloodname of Indrek, I think was his name&hellip; had not only a weapon of iron, but also, I noticed, armor. &nbsp;Obviously, the Ashwalker was felled by telling blow, succumbed as lowlanders are known to, and was recovered. &nbsp;Curiously, when recovered, they took the scar of the telling blow from her; I believe to chide her, as the whole challenge seemed to be met with an air of... &nbsp;well, disapproval by all joined. &nbsp;I figured this too harsh by far, and so felt moved to converse with her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">&ldquo;I do not wish to say it, but I believe you acted unwisely, sib. &nbsp;You Stalkers were always far removed from&hellip; interacting with the Lowlanders. &nbsp;From what I observed&hellip; and had inflicted upon me&hellip; they are unknowable. &nbsp;Alien. &nbsp;We cannot presume anything from familiar actions. It is possible for one to act in a familiar way, by unfamiliar motivations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">...You actually hadn&rsquo;t thought about that. &nbsp;You knew, to some degree, that Lowlanders would probably act differently, but you hadn&rsquo;t really considered how differently they would think. &nbsp;You just considered that their representatives to this potluck were likely to be&hellip; eccentric. &nbsp;But what if that was normal for them?</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;Well, sib, if you thought that unwise, what follows is likely worth greater chastisement. &nbsp;You are correct, I was thinking of their actions as foolish; I felt that they had been poorly trained, or simply lax in their adherence to ritual. &nbsp;As such, when one of their number&hellip; I believe him to be some equivalent of theirs to the Bakshish, based on his professed skills&hellip; attempted to act disrespectfully to the Ashwalker and myself during our discussion, I felt it was an opportune time to demonstrate the superiority of Aggro Ritual.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You expected him to frown, or scoff, but surprisingly, he seems curious. &nbsp;Well, then. &nbsp;Not only Lowlanders are unknowable.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;Being that he seemed to be a non-combatant&hellip; although he did wield a weapon, oddly&hellip; I made clear my intent to issue a Rite of Refusal. &nbsp;I hoped to quell his ego through a demonstration of Art. &nbsp;Unfortunately, a Blade who bore the Epithet of Warmaster General instructed that duals were to be held outside- curious she had not done so for the first one, but there must be some mad Lowlander reason for the distinction. &nbsp;Unfortunately, in so accepting this condition, I was separated from the Layer. &nbsp;I cannot account for her actions at that time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">&ldquo;I would not worry overmuch. &nbsp;It seems unlikely that the Layer could have done anything foolish in so little time. &nbsp;My interactions with her have painted her as a sane individual.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;I wish I could be so confident. &nbsp;It was during this absence that she brokered her deal with the Lowlanders to provide us with the nutrition we carried back. &nbsp;While I was not told the full details, I have inferred that this is not to be the last shipment; on the return, The Layer made many inquiries regarding the Aggro&rsquo;s upcoming need for Iron and Steel. &nbsp;I believe she intends to barter such for further nutrition.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">At that, he grows quiet. &nbsp;His features sag. &nbsp;No discernable emotion crosses them. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Then, his gaze turns to look at his ruined arm. &nbsp;You know why it still seems wounded so, although the fire was many days past. &nbsp;He intends to heal this injury naturally, to let his body become accustomed to this new, scarred shape, so he may bear the mark of this firestorm forever. &nbsp;But does he intend it to be a mark of pride? Or one of shame?</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">&ldquo;I wish you had been here, sib. &nbsp;Few know those treacherous Lowlands as you and your Stalkers. &nbsp;Perhaps with your guidance, our exuberance could have been contained.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">It seemed simple enough. &nbsp;We descended. &nbsp;We stripped. &nbsp;But the fauna were evasive. &nbsp;And even stripped of their leaves, the foliage, the forest concealed so much. &nbsp;With that out of the way, we could pursue them freely. &nbsp;Some creatures may outrun an Aggro, but none could outpace us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">He gazes into your eyes. &nbsp;You see pain there. &nbsp;You know it has nothing to do with his wounds.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c26 c12">&ldquo;We should have known that flame follows no ritual, respects no plan. &nbsp;But we did not consider this. &nbsp;We could not have known to. &nbsp;Without </span><span class="c26 c5 c12">The Tome</span><span class="c26 c12">, we had no guidance in the matter. &nbsp; At one time, that explanation could be used as an </span><span class="c5 c12 c26">Excuse.</span><span class="c23 c12">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">His face contorts into a rictus of rage. &nbsp;He slams his injured arm against his bedpost, and with a </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">crack</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">that is deafening in the confined space, the post gives way. &nbsp;To avoid sprawling over as his bed collapses, he stands quickly, head nearly colliding with the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">He slams the arm against the wall. &nbsp;This is sturdy enough to restrain his fury, but blisters burst and blood flows from the battered, burned limb. &nbsp;Once more, twice more, thrice more he strikes, leaving an impression of gore.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Thankfully, this seems to have been enough. &nbsp;Pain of the body can overwhelm pain of the mind. &nbsp;Sometimes, it is a welcome replacement. &nbsp;Exhaustion floods his features. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You take your hand off your kuthe. &nbsp;You will not need it today.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">&ldquo;...Your Trial. &nbsp;The one with the Lowlander Bakshish. &nbsp;What was the result? &nbsp;You were victorious, quiaff?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;...Aff, sib, but I should not have been. &nbsp;Though I am skilled in my Art, rightfully prideful, the Lowlander was far from incapable. &nbsp;His tactics and methods were crude...rude&hellip; of ill attitude. &nbsp;But those Numbered saw nothing to object to. &nbsp;I was put off balance. &nbsp;He discovered a weak point, pursued it with fervor, and my riposte was clumsy. &nbsp;I broke meter. &nbsp;I even failed scheme, at the end. &nbsp;Victory should have been his, but for reasons I cannot imagine, he quit the Circle before telling blow. &nbsp;He shamed himself utterly, and yet he did so with the air of a man impatient and annoyed, not one fearful or disgra. &nbsp;&ldquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">He grows quiet again. &nbsp;His oozing arm drips audibly on the flagstones. </span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">&ldquo;We cannot keep doing this, sib. &nbsp;The Aggro cannot. &nbsp;I cannot. &nbsp;We cannot keep blundering into the wild unknown, unguided, untrained, and unheeding of the dangers ahead. &nbsp;We promised ourselves after the Extermination that we would never be found wanting again. &nbsp;We must now consider what it will actually take to stick to that promise.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">We cannot keep beating against a flame that will not turn. &nbsp;We are found. &nbsp;Whether by this Seeker, whether by the Layer&rsquo;s words, whether by curious souls, the truth is that we can no longer rely on our greatest shield. &nbsp;It would just turn into another exercise where you must kill everyone who notices you are killing everyone.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c26 c12">If we must be found, if the Lowlanders must come, then we- the Aggro, the Crag, everyone- cannot afford to be ignorant of them any longer. &nbsp;And without </span><span class="c26 c5 c12">The Tome</span><span class="c23 c12">, the only ones who know about Lowlanders&hellip; are Lowlanders.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You feel excitement coursing through you. &nbsp;You had never imagined that the conversation could go in this direction. &nbsp;You would never. &nbsp;expected such words. &nbsp;Not from Saltik. &nbsp;Not from the Echo of Blood.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">&ldquo;Sib. Embebi. &nbsp;I do not know what plans the Layer&hellip; or, indeed, the Esteemed&hellip; have laid out for these Lowlanders. &nbsp;Whatever it is, you must become indispensable to it. &nbsp;We must have knowledge. &nbsp;We must have foundation. &nbsp;We must have guidance. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c26 c12">For so long, I have tried to guide the Aggro back to The Path. Back to our glory. &nbsp;Back to where we </span><span class="c26 c5 c12">once</span><span class="c23 c12">&nbsp;belonged. </span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c23 c12">The Path is Sundered. &nbsp;I now accept that. &nbsp;Now&hellip; we must Trod Uncertainty.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">...Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You didn&rsquo;t expect that, either.</span></p>
<hr><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">The expanse of Eschaton sweeps beneath you. &nbsp;From here, the Pagoda of the Esteemed, it stretches in all directions. &nbsp;Close by, life still hums in the streets in spite of want and deprivation. &nbsp;Further out is little more than bones and ruin, still abandoned after all these years, still an eventual project on your mental list. &nbsp;You had thought of those ruins as an unfortunate result of necessary triage, the dead left so that the living could still be tended to. &nbsp;An unfortunate charnel circle made of shattered stone and broken futures.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">At one time, it seemed unsightly. &nbsp;Now, having traversed the Floor of the World, the great expanse of the Lowlands, and all the mysterious dangers that lurk within, all you can think of is how </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">sensible</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;it is. &nbsp;Even in death, the Ruined Monasteries have a clarity to their chaos that is completely absent down there.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;And after the Aggro made that scene? &nbsp;What occurred afterwards?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">You return your gaze to the Estee- no, to Ledret. &nbsp;She is Ledret, and you are </span><span class="c16 c12">Slabal</span><span class="c2">, in this context. &nbsp;You believe it is supposed to make you more informal. &nbsp;You aren&rsquo;t confident it succeeds.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;From that point, I am afraid that the conversation grew even more confusing&hellip; and distressing. &nbsp;I cannot help but think there was a fundamental element of it which I understood. &nbsp;I want to stress this point, as I am not confident that my report on such can be free of these fundamental misconceptions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Slabal, whatever you may think of your abilities, I have complete faith in your attention to detail, and retention of knowledge. &nbsp;I will take your warning into consideration, but I am inclined to believe whatever you say. &nbsp;More to the point, your report could use a little </span><span class="c11 c5">less</span><span class="c7 c11">&nbsp;of your clarifications of lack of clarity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Her words sound chiding, but there is an expression of mild mirth on her face. &nbsp;You believe she is attempting to be humorous. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s likely successful.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;Very well, Ledret. &nbsp;Afterwards, the assembled conversation seemed to return to a topic they had been discussing beforehand; namely, an individual that seemed to be of particular note to all of those assembled. &nbsp;They were described as appearing as one of the &lsquo;Blade&rsquo; Elves, and as having white locks, and a sword crafted of silver. &nbsp;However, according to their reports, while she appeared to be a typical elf, evidently she was actually-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;</span><span class="c11 c5">Attentive Aggro</span><span class="c7 c11">, I thank you for your services this day! &nbsp;I would invite you to end this shift of your watch prematurely. &nbsp;Seek rest and reduce your activities, to better conserve in these lean times.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You halt your explanation, surprised by Ledret&rsquo;s interruption. &nbsp;You get the feeling there may be some context you are not aware of. &nbsp;Although, you are aware that frequent rest cycles for the Aggro are part of the resource management plans that have been sweeping Eschaton&hellip; although you were reasonably confident that such had not applied to the Esteemed&rsquo;s personal protectors. &nbsp; Nevertheless, you wait for the Aggro guards to make their ceremonial exit before speaking again.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;...I feel that I may have made a misstep due to missing context, Ledret. &nbsp;If you could-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;It is of no great concern, Slabal. &nbsp;You should not allow those actions to interrupt your report. &ldquo;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Her words are now cold, and clipped. &nbsp;In spite of what she has said, you think there may be something amiss.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c9">&ldquo;...very well. &nbsp;According to their reports, this individual was not an Elf, but an </span><span class="c16 c12 c28">Animal </span><span class="c7 c9">travelling in disguise. &nbsp;Some reported her as being hostile. &nbsp;Others, as polite. &nbsp;Most seemed of the opinion that such a thing was of no significant threat. &nbsp;This is where I believed I was missing an important detail, and so I asked for clarification. &nbsp;The assembled elves clarified. &nbsp;It is my belief that, whatever the truth of it, they truly believe that there is one of those creatures capable of travelling among their number without attempting to slaughter them all. &nbsp;Such a claim seems&hellip; unlikely.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Her expression has shifted significantly. &nbsp;You believe she is concerned. &nbsp;Ah, of course. &nbsp;You hadn&rsquo;t fully considered the potential harm such a claim could cause if taken at face value. &nbsp;While it bears little sense after due consideration, beforehand it would imply that there are potentially enemies capable of hiding anywhere, even among the populace. &nbsp;While this is true regardless, it would not do well to put it at the forefront of the people&rsquo;s minds, especially not when they are already strained from want.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;I understand your concern, Ledret. &nbsp;However, I think their claim is unlikely. &nbsp;Even if there is such an entity, their behaviour would lend more to them being some other form of shape shifter, some abomination, fey, or outsider. &nbsp;I have been meaning to discuss with The First regarding potential-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;That will not be necessary, Slabal. &nbsp;The truth of the matter is clear, even to one with no greater training. &nbsp;This creature, if it should happen to exist at all, cannot be what they claim it to be. &nbsp;As you have said yourself many times this evening, Lowlanders have no end of madnesses which they cling to. &nbsp;It is far more likely that the creature has no true validity, and instead exists as a Phantom Tale, or perhaps as some misdirection to conceal their own attempts to spy on each other. &nbsp;You should pay it no more heed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You feel somewhat vindicated to hear the Esteemed echo your thoughts on the matter. &nbsp;While you had fair confidence that there could be no truth to such a claim, hearing one with such a broader experience to pull from helps make you able to confidently state your position on such.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;...This creature- you haven&rsquo;t spoken to anyone else about it, have you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Ah, she&rsquo;s concerned about the rumor. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;No, Ledret. &nbsp;Given the extraordinary nature of the claim, I was hoping to confer with those more aware of such creatures. &nbsp;The Aggro I traveled with did not strike me as such, nor the Onagi to whom I spoke with on my return. &nbsp;My intentions were to refer to either you or The First&hellip; first&hellip; and of the two, you were the- the first I encountered.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c18">Too many firsts in a row. &nbsp;You dislike when that happens. &nbsp;It sounds like babbling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;That is well, then. &nbsp;As I have said, give no more credence to such madness. &nbsp;While I would hope no Crag would be so foolish as to harbor belief in such an outlandish claim, in these trying times, it is best not to tempt Fate so.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You understand the logic. &nbsp;Perhaps it is something that can be dissected more thoroughly when current troubles have been smoothed. &nbsp;At that point, there should be little fear of irrational behavior.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;So, with that rumormongering aside, what else occurred of import? &nbsp;I notice you have not yet mentioned how you came to carry all of these&hellip; Potatoes&hellip; back to Eschaton.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You briefly consider correcting Ledret&rsquo;s pronunciation of the foreign plant, but dismiss the thought as needlessly pedantic.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;I had not yet mentioned that, but it was the next item of note that was discussed once further concerns with the creature had passed. &nbsp;Having done my utmost to get the bearing of the Otherelves, I then made the purpose of my journey clear, and enquired whether any of their number bore any spare produce. &nbsp;I then reiterated my previous assertion that we would be able to provide material goods in return, as is Otherelf custom. &nbsp;Although most were noncommittal, or enquired after materials that we do not have in abundance, one, the elderly Blade to which I referred previously, queried about our availability of Iron. &nbsp;While we do not have this in spades as of yet, we do have a fair amount on hand which could be bartered with, and if my reports are accurate, one of our recent attempts to explore the surrounding mountainside revealed a particularly bountiful source which we could exploit. &nbsp;I believed this sufficient grounds to broker an agreement, though I made clear that full production of said iron would likely take some time to establish. &nbsp;Their eagerness for the material seemed to overpower any inherent drive to barter they may have had; whether in generosity, or in a desperate attempt to seize the agreement ahead of the others, they even provided the nutrition we brought back, as a &lsquo;show of good faith&rsquo;. &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You see calm return to her expression. &nbsp;There is still a note of strain, however.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;Slabal, these Blades- do you know what they use iron for?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">That question was unforeseen. &nbsp;Not unanswerable, however.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;To my examination, numerous purposes. &nbsp;I witnessed it in structure reinforcements, tools, decorations, armor, armaments&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Oh. &nbsp;You see what she was getting at.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;...I had not considered that consequence of our agreement. It should have occurred to me that any group sufficiently combative as to name themselves after potential weapons would likely put that resource to more militant purposes than to civic ones. &nbsp;It is true that by providing them with more of this resource, we would be supplying a potential threat. &nbsp;This is yet another ignorance of mine.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9"><br>I do not think it would be too late to prevent our arrangement. &nbsp;Although we have consumed their show of faith, it would not be impossible to simply renege on the agreed upon return. &nbsp;I will state that such does not sit well with me, however.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;Nor with I, Slabal. &nbsp;Even with Lo-Otherelves, I apologize- one should not simply discard their word. &nbsp;While this is a concern for me, it is one that I believe we can overlook, in the short term; given their apparent attempts at generous displays, it is likely that they do not intend any aggressive overtures in the immediate. &nbsp;Besides, given the great profusion and chaotic nature of the greater whole of Otherelves, it seems far more likely that they will find reason to turn their newly forged weapons against others first&hellip; particularly if they have become reliant on our material. &nbsp;Indeed, we could do far worse than to be a trusted provider to a race which holds such interest in a martial identity. We shall simply have to ensure that we are not overly generous with our provision of the metal, lest they believe they could have sufficient amount to turn on us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You&hellip; aren&rsquo;t sure if that logic is sound. &nbsp;But numerous times, you have proved yourself inexperienced and lacking context in the nature of this&hellip; peoplescraft? &nbsp; You should see if there is a specific term for this.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You sit in quiet for a while, as Ledret takes the opportunity to partake in more Brew. &nbsp;You declined her offer, this time. &nbsp;For some reason, she has been steeping it even longer than usual.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Tell me, Slabal&hellip; While I have heard much of what happened around you, and to you, while you were on this long journey, I have gotten little feel for how it </span><span class="c11 c5">impacted</span><span class="c7 c11">&nbsp;you. &nbsp;What did you think of the Lowlands? &nbsp;Of its people? &nbsp;Speak not of specific odd customs; I want to feel your impression.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Ah. &nbsp;This variety of query. &nbsp;While you have never objected, you find it distasteful; largely because, in spite of numerous attempts, you never seem to be able to truly grasp what it is Ledret is hoping to hear. &nbsp;You know what the truth of the matter is; &nbsp;you think it was a long journey with many strange specific experiences. &nbsp;You think that the Lowlands have a great many dangers and discoveries. &nbsp;You think that the people there have specific odd customs and live in a different context. &nbsp;Telling her these things never seems to please her when she asks that question. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Oh well. &nbsp;Time to attempt once more.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;The Lowlands was&hellip; a place devoid of appropriate context. &nbsp;There was little there I was knowledgeable of, and that made it difficult to operate effectively. &nbsp;Often, as we have discussed, things which seemed to be familiar often had different contexts, rendering my ability to predict off of them hindered.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">It was a wild, chaotic, amazing, fascinating place, its people unknowable, curious, curious, and, occasionally, completely unintelligible. &ldquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, she&rsquo;s making that same expression she usually makes when you try to answer those kinds of questions. &nbsp;You think you have failed to meet her expectations again.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">...A stray thought hits you. &nbsp;You aren&rsquo;t sure if it&rsquo;s what she wants, but&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;My travels in the Lowlands were one of the most unsettling and confusing of my entire long life. &nbsp;If I were given the option, I would never return there as long as I live.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">You don&rsquo;t know why, but that seems to elicit a smile from Ledret. &nbsp;Briefly, you consider telling her that the statement was an alteration of one that you had been told by one of the Stalkers regarding their perceptions of the Lowlands. &nbsp;You dismiss this is likely unnecessary knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;Good Slabal. &nbsp;Very good. &nbsp;Sadly, I wish I could guarantee you of such, but I&rsquo;m afraid that you are now one of the chief representatives of our people to these Otherelves. &nbsp;Likely, when you return to their settlement with Iron in tow, they will be expecting to see you in order to negotiate the ultimate nature of their exchange.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Oh, you had omitted a detail. &nbsp;It is perhaps a pertinent one; while you are not sure it will eliminate any need for you to travel into the Lowlands, at least it may mitigate it.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;There was an element of the deal I neglected to mention. &nbsp;While these Blades are the ones with whom we are conducting the exchange, we are to be aided by another group of Otherelves, the ones who call themselves Rivers. &nbsp;They have a sizeable&hellip; &lsquo;flotilla&rsquo;... of water-going vehicles, and offered to carry the traded goods back and forth along the sizeable and numerous bodies of water in the Lowlands. &nbsp;Indeed, they even offered to do so without need for compensation; all they required is that we do not challenge their claims to said waterways. &nbsp;I believed it unlikely that we would ever find reason to make such a challenge.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Oh. &nbsp;Concern has crept back onto her face. You think you know why. &nbsp;Better to let her clarify, however.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;Slabal&hellip; how are these Rivers planning to finalize such a transportation? &nbsp;They are not aware of Eschaton&rsquo;s location, are they?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;No, Ledret. &nbsp;I did keep that in consideration. &nbsp;While the negotiations did require us to provide some idea of our location, I deliberately obfuscated the specifics. &nbsp;Instead, I had indicated that we would conduct the exchange on a water bank some distance away from Eschaton, allowing us to retain that obfuscation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c2">Good. &nbsp;She seems relieved. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;Indeed, the discussion coincidentally turned out to be in our favor. &nbsp;I was informed that the bulk of their flotilla was actually heading extremely close to Eschaton. &nbsp;Indeed, since they were engaged in a widespread search for another group of Otherelves, it is likely that had we not attempted to broker such a deal, they may have discovered Eschaton independently. &nbsp;Fortunately, timely work by another Otherelf&hellip; the ones I questioned the Elfity of, the Cryptids&hellip; must have succeeded in diverting that fleet, as they would have otherwise arrived in this area long before we would have returned.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c9">...</span><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s unusual. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s staring at you. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not in the way she normally stares at people. &nbsp;It is more wide eyed. &nbsp;Big enough for you to see the cataracts creeping in at the edges once more. &nbsp;It even seems she has relinquished control of her jaw. &nbsp;You are concerned. &nbsp;Ledret is of advanced age, after all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;Ledret? &nbsp;Are you well? &nbsp;Do you have brain damage?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">She doesn&rsquo;t respond immediately. &nbsp;With her guards gone as well, your concern grows, as you are uncertain if you would be able to heal her of some kind of lethal malady in time. &nbsp;Just before you stand to get help, however, she at last responds, although not to your question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;Are&hellip; are you saying that had it not been for your presence&hellip; these Otherelves would have sailed to Eschaton entirely by coincidence?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;...I cannot say whether it would have been entirely coincidence. &nbsp;That is how they seemed to describe the situation, however, that may have just been an attempt to further confuse me. &nbsp;If so, it was an unnecessary excess, I was already sufficiently confused.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">&ldquo;And&hellip; and they </span><span class="c11 c5">were</span><span class="c7 c11">&nbsp;diverted away? &nbsp;They are not going to approach here directly?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;To my understanding, no. &nbsp;Once I expressed how much we relied on our obscured location, they seemed more than willing to redirect their search efforts elsewhere. &nbsp;The manner in which the redirection was achieved was somewhat unnerving, but apparently efficacious.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">She is silent again for a long time. &nbsp;The look upon her face softens somewhat, but it seems that she is lost in thought. &nbsp;Perhaps she has decided to become adrift again, although she usually attempts to avoid that during your discussions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Finally, she speaks, and waves a hand weakly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c11">&ldquo;...Thank you, Slabal. &nbsp;You may go. &nbsp;Please finish the details of this exchange, and ensure they are conducted correctly. &nbsp;It is clear that only you can be trusted.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c11"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Her final statement is&hellip; disappointing, but not unexpected. &nbsp;Still, you see no grounds to dispute it. &nbsp;Besides, her dismissal means you will have more time available to check in on the Quartzhouses project. &nbsp;You understand it has grown substantially in your absence, and wish to ensure the quality of the work.</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">You are </span><span class="c16 c12">Esteemed Elpahka Ledret Blakenova</span><span class="c2">.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18 c5">Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</span></p>
<hr><p class="c0"><span class="c21 c16 c18 c5"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">You are </span><span class="c16 c12">The First Among Scholars</span><span class="c2">, and boy, did you prove it today.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">When you got up this morning, and hammered down that panacea of wakefulness, you had planned to </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">get shit done.</span><span class="c16 c12">&nbsp; </span><span class="c16 c18">And now, at the end of the day, </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">shit has gotten done</span><span class="c2">. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">While all of the Heads of various Studies had made some impressive gains in knowledge during your little&hellip; downward turn&hellip; the one thing that all of them lacked was a mind capable of keeping the </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">big picture</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in it. &nbsp;A hundred small stones may cause a damaging impact, but all of them willed together is more effective for its mass!</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s not really a saying, you were just kind of riffing it. &nbsp;It kind of works. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll mull on it later.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">The central point is that now, with the various Studies organized, and their findings collated, you have a plan of action that will see to it that this Blight will soon be a thing of the past!</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">FIRST: Thanks to the efforts of the Onagi, the seed vaults of the&hellip; remaining strains&hellip; had been filled to sufficient quantities during the last season. &nbsp;With those precious seeds safely stored away in will-sealed containers, that left more of those Quartzhouses open to supply precious foodstuffs. &nbsp;Now, having coordinated your intentions with them (although not with The Layer, who has still been frustratingly difficult to find) you believe that, with sufficient guidance from the Elpahka&hellip; namely, if they follow your &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">precisely</span><span class="c16 c18">&hellip; you can strike a perfect balance between using the existing quartzhouses and temple gardens to provide enough food to keep everyone on the </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">brink</span><span class="c16 c18">&nbsp;of starvation for the few weeks you&rsquo;ll need to enact your genius plan. &nbsp;If it turns out that The Esteemed&rsquo;s insane plan of bartering with Lowlanders isn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">100%</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;insane, then anything gained from that is just dusting on the mash!</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">So, while the Onagi are maintaining the quartzhouses, and the Elpahka are keeping everything in balance, what are your Bakshish going to be doing?<br></span><span class="c16 c18 c5">They&rsquo;re going to follow your original damn plan, that&rsquo;s what</span><span class="c2">.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Although you&rsquo;ll admit, you&rsquo;ve added a bit of the others&rsquo; research in, in order to make it more enticing this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;So, here&rsquo;s the plan.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">You&rsquo;re talking to yourself, of course. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve been doing that more frequently recently. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve been some of the best conversations of your life. &nbsp;At least, they usually result in fewer headaches.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Right. Eschaton is filled with all number of partially ruined buildings and temples and whatnot that we still haven&rsquo;t found use for. &nbsp;Now, the Onagi figured that one out, and started using them to make Quartzhouses. &nbsp;We can do the same thing, although just less finesse, more </span><span class="c8 c5">scale</span><span class="c7 c8">.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">The biggest problem with killing the Blight is it&rsquo;s widespread presence. &nbsp;We tried to starve it out in the fields, but that&rsquo;s far too big an area to patrol; eventually, something will grow that we missed, and that something will come in contact with the Blight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;So, obvious, rock-on-the-head solution? &nbsp;Take a chapter from the Onagi&rsquo;s saga! &nbsp;Isolate the dirt!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;Using not just some, but a BUNCH of those old buildings, we can just will closed the doors, the windows, whatever, make ourselves a nice, huge container for soil to fallow in. &nbsp;Pick up soil, clean it out, dump it in, totally will the structure closed, and then ignore it for a couple weeks to make sure you got everything.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Now, that, in and of itself, is pretty simple, pretty basic, and far too slow. &nbsp;We need a </span><span class="c8 c5">lot</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;of clean soil, we need it fast, and we need it </span><span class="c8 c5">rich</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;so that when we start to use it, it just grows like crazy. &nbsp;So, we won&rsquo;t just be making soil silos- we&rsquo;ll be making soil </span><span class="c8 c5">farms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;Yes, buildings full of sanitized dirt! &nbsp;Once it&rsquo;s sanitized, you can then start enriching it; water, silt, mineral runoff, so forth. On top of all of that oxshit, you can mix in, well, oxshit! &nbsp;Plenty of enrichment there. And then, to help expand that, fine dust and powdered rock, as basic filler. &nbsp;With all of that, you&rsquo;ve effectively got clean dirt&hellip; that grows more clean dirt!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;Now, once we&rsquo;ve got a huge supply of dirt, a supply which is steadily growing, then there&rsquo;s the tricky part&hellip; although I guess the real tricky part is the sheer amount of labor involved in moving all that dirt, but if our fields are fallow, we should have a lot of Samra tenders not doing anything&hellip; we have to get rid of the true source of the problem. &nbsp;The true source of the problem is all the plant-bearing dirt in the fields. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">So, once we have the dirt we need&hellip; we burn the rest.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;Fire has been an odd motif recently, huh? &nbsp;However, there&rsquo;s reason behind this method. &nbsp;Back before we were taking pains to effectively combat the Blight, we would just burn the fields where we found it; knowing what we know now, this method was unusually effective, i.e. that it worked at all to combat the Blight. &nbsp;I theorize that in addition to the benefit of killing off the extant plant matter, giving it nothing to feed on, the Blight may be vulnerable to high temperatures. &nbsp;And so, what we couldn&rsquo;t do with magic&hellip; we can do with just a lot of fire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;Then, after several weeks of repeated scorchings, that soil would doubtlessly be nigh-useless&hellip; until we reintroduce our new supply of fresh, clean soil. &nbsp;And there you have it. &nbsp;Agriculture starts over from scratch in about a month!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;Make good dirt, burn the rest, when it&rsquo;s burned to uselessness, and cleanliness, put good dirt in. &nbsp;Good dirt plus bad dirt plus time equals good dirt!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">Simple. &nbsp;Succinct. &nbsp;Flawl- well, okay, flaw-</span><span class="c16 c18 c5">reduced</span><span class="c16 c18">. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s not get carried away here. &nbsp;And best of all&hellip; if these Dirt Farms work, they&rsquo;re a Proof-of-Concept for similar structures you&rsquo;d like to set up elsewhere! After seeing how barren much of the rest of the mountainscape is, having a method for having </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">some</span><span class="c16 c18">&nbsp;usable soil, and then using local grit, dust, and, well, shit to turn it into </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">a lot</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of usable soil means that you won&rsquo;t have to worry about crop extinction again, since the crops will be a multi-mountain species!</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">You grin at you, pleased with yourself. &nbsp;You grin right back at you. &nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better partner.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">You lift the vial in your hand. &nbsp;A little bit of the green liquid still sticks to the side.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pleasant Hallucinations&rdquo; seems like a bit of an understatement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;So. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s the next big idea?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s this funny little crystal we found recently, called </span><span class="c8 c5">noqual...</span><span class="c7 c8">:&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<hr><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Green. &nbsp;Green and brown and yellow and more green. &nbsp;Some black, but not much. &nbsp;Almost no gray at all.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">You are </span><span class="c12 c16">Slabal</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;You were not given the option.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Once again, you find yourself in the Lowlands. &nbsp;Once again, you find yourself in the somewhat disorienting company of the Stalker known as Embebi. &nbsp;Once again, you are trudging through the uncomfortable foliage underfoot to a destination you barely understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">There are a few novelties this time around, however. &nbsp;You do have a rather impressive train of oxen, bearing heavy loads of limonite, magnetite, and some natural pyrite&hellip; that last one being of particular interest to you. &nbsp;You appreciate it&rsquo;s pragmatism. &nbsp;It seems almost a shame to have to trade it for something as transient as nutrition. &nbsp;You also have more Aggro around you than last time; as you understand, they are there to keep you safe while the bulk of the Stalkers make special note of this route. &nbsp;If it is found to be sufficiently peaceful, it may even serve as the regular conduit for this transaction. &nbsp;And, of course, the difference that does calm you somewhat; this trip </span><span class="c16 c18 c5">should</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;be much, much shorter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">While you are distracted, Embebi seems to have snuck up behind you. &nbsp;She slaps you on the back, in your opinion with excessive force. &nbsp;She has said that it is a sign of camaraderie. &nbsp;You question that assertion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c15">&ldquo;So, once more into the beech, my friends! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you worry at all, Layer. &nbsp;Compared to our last trek, this one will be a mere jaunt. &nbsp;There&rsquo;ll be some treacherous terrain ahead, of course, but at least it&rsquo;ll be treacherous in new ways than last time. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s how the Lowlands keeps you on your toes!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">A number of thoughts run through your head. &nbsp;Why it seems irrational to not worry. &nbsp;Why the distance seems less important than the difficulty. &nbsp;Why new danger seems no better, indeed worse, than known danger.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c7 c9">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">None of them are relevant. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t really a conversation. &nbsp;You get the idea that she just likes to hear herself talk. &nbsp;You had been somewhat relieved when she seemed more taciturn on your trip back to Eschaton. &nbsp;It seems that mood has now evaporated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">She grins at you. &nbsp;You would suspect that it&rsquo;s a cocksure expression. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c15">&ldquo;Ack, Onalpha! </span><span class="c15 c5 c21">Stalkers! Guardform, tenspread, cam, draw! Calltargs, skirmpos, aroee- Open!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c16 c18">Laughter burbles around you, drifting from the bushes and brambles through which the Stalkers crawl. &nbsp;As one, they respond with an excited </span><span class="c16 c12">AFF, ACK!</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">A wind blows over the shrubbery. &nbsp;It promises adventure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c18 c29">ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc</span></p>
<h2 class="c27" id="h.g7v76tchvo3t"><span class="c35 c12 c37">Skill Usage</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c12">Economic</span><span>: </span><span class="c5">Making good on their bargain with the Blade Elves, Slabal and Embebi lead a caravan of raw iron towards the northern shores of&hellip; that big blue wet thing. &nbsp;Although unskilled in tradecraft, the full unoccupied labor force of the Samra were put to extracting, by pick, if needed, as much ore as possible to present a favorable trade. &nbsp;Hopefully, that quantity can be a quality all of its own. &nbsp;After all, if they can barter for a sufficient quantity of food, it will give the other Bloodlines all the time they need to handle the Blight however they can.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span>Attempting to </span><span class="c5 c12">Resolve the event </span><span class="c12">The Blight </span><span>by utilizing the </span><span class="c12">Trade(Merchants)</span><span>&nbsp;skill to barter for sufficient foodstuffs to weather whatever plan may be necessary to resume normal agriculture. As the full force of the Samra was behind this endeavor to recover from what they have lost, they will Spend a Fate Point to </span><span class="c5">Invoke</span><span>&nbsp;the Aspect </span><span class="c5">We Are Uncut </span><span class="c7 c17">for Proficiency, recognizing their desperate need to restore some manner of equilibrium.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c21 c17 c5">Thanks to the timely assistance of the Rivers, the assembly and transportation of these goods takes a relatively small amount of the Onagi&rsquo;s time. &nbsp;Recognizing that, while their need for iron is small but nonzero, it is important to establish independent supplies of iron that they can use to barter with. &nbsp;Earlier scouting has shown that the Mountains to the East of Eschaton are sufficiently laden with these minerals, and more; &nbsp;Now all that is needed is the basic infrastructure to exploit them.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c5">Motivated</span><span>&nbsp;by the River Elves&rsquo; </span><span class="c5">Elf Express</span><span>, the Onagi are attempting to use the skill </span><span class="c12">Infrastructure(Establishment)</span><span>&nbsp;in order to establish </span><span class="c5">Outpost Eparchy</span><span class="c7 c17">&nbsp;in the Iron-bearing territory discovered earlier. &nbsp;Curiously, the orders left by the Layer for this Outpost place it at a much lower elevation than Eschaton itself; the reasons are unexplained, but her word is all they need.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c12">Political</span><span>: </span><span class="c5">There are no more stores to empty, no more reserves to plunder; it has only been by desperate and last minute attempts and the utmost careful rationing by all the bloodlines that has kept the bulk of Eschaton alive. &nbsp;Now, when there is nothing left, the only thing that can be counted upon is Crag Resilience. &nbsp;The Elpahka now must work hand in hand with all other bloodlines, toiling day and night in the ways they toil best; as guides, as soothers, and as leaders. &nbsp;While there is little they can hope to do to fully alleviate the Blight, perhaps they can enable the people of Eschaton to hold out just a little while longer. &nbsp;Who knows; perhaps inspiration can come from the most unusual places.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span>Attempting </span><span class="c5 c12">Resolve the event </span><span class="c12">The Blight</span><span>&nbsp;by utilizing the </span><span class="c12">Recovery(Leadership)</span><span>&nbsp;skill to soothe the fears and woes of a beleaguered people. &nbsp;They have nothing more to offer but hope, no strength to give but passion. &nbsp;They are willing to spend every resource available to keep the spirit of the Crag from failing; for without the people, there is no Eschaton. &nbsp;Indeed, it may be these same people who can find a solution no others had considered. Unfortunately, due to previous ailments, this roll will also suffer from a Setback die.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c12">Military: </span><span class="c5">The last few months have been a sour lesson for the Aggro. &nbsp;Although their actions kept Eschaton teetering on the brink for a while longer, they sacrificed their strength, their will, and even their lives&hellip; and did so to only momentary reprieve. &nbsp;They are spent. &nbsp;The only hope now glitters with those who were outside of the blaze, the Stalkers, in the hopes that the schemes they once scoffed at may be ultimately successful. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span>Attempting to utilize the </span><span class="c12">Reconnaissance(Pathfinders)</span><span class="c7 c17">&nbsp;Skill in the single Plains square, marked with a green circle. &nbsp;While not directly involved, the lack of leadership from Echo while he broods and bleeds provides a degree of disorganization, resulting in a Setback die.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c12">Mental:</span><span class="c21 c17 c5">&nbsp;Back and more motivated than ever, The First has a mad or brilliant scheme; although fire has been a symbol of the Crag people&rsquo;s woes for more than a year, perhaps through a bizarre plan of dirt preservation and cultivation, flame could be put to a productive purpose for once. &nbsp;Whatever the logic of this plan, he seems frightfully motivated by it.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span>Attempting to </span><span class="c5 c12">Resolve the event </span><span class="c12">The Blight</span><span>&nbsp;by using the </span><span class="c12">Mysticism(Creation)</span><span>&nbsp;Skill to develop the technology/concept/I&rsquo;mreallynotsure </span><span class="c5">Dirt Farms</span><span>. With a safely preserved supply of soil, purified and isolated to ensure that no vegetation can prevent the Blight&rsquo;s dieoff, it matters little what methods are used to keep the majority of the soil free of foliage, be it fire, poison, or even just plain salt. &nbsp;However, the storage demands for this oddball plan are enormous, and without consulting anyone else, he claims vast swathes of the untouched ruins of Eschaton for his mad purposes. &nbsp;In doing so, he will gain a </span><span class="c5">Free Invocation</span><span>&nbsp;of the Aspect </span><span class="c5">Temple Ruins</span><span class="c7 c17">, using it to add a Proficiency die to the roll. &nbsp;Furthermore, as magical purification, just at a sustainable scale, is still a fundamental part of the plan, he retains the Bonus Die gained for the independent studies of the Heads.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c7 c24 c12">End of Turn </span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12 c35">Results-</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12">Economic- Merchants- </span><span class="c4">Wow, that was&hellip; </span><span class="c4 c5">something</span><span class="c4">. Slabal is not entirely sure what just happened. Well, the results are clear. The iron ores are gone, and the carts are now absolutely packed with what the river elves </span><span class="c4 c5">claim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is food. Fish pickled in strange smelling vinegar, a variety of wet looking vegetables that are probably edible, mountains of what you thought were actually rocks until a river elf showed you how to crack one open and eat the inside. Oysters, he called them. That, and many hard shelled creatures that resemble oceangoing abominations. The river elves claim it is all edible. That and they threw in large amounts of what they call &ldquo;lagniappe.&rdquo; You aren&rsquo;t sure the exact translation of that word, but it seems to consist of random small amounts of whatever the river elves can think of thrown in with completely no regard to how it balances out the scales of trade. Mais weh. Oh, </span><span class="c4 c5">damn</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;they&rsquo;ve got you saying it too.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">Well, it turned out for the best. The crag elves have </span><span class="c4 c5">no idea</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;how to actually barter a trade. The river elves were happy to teach with their infectious attitudes and absolutely incomprehensible speech. They showed many a Crag how to go through the basics of not just a barter, but knowing what you have and what the other guy has. Organizing it, presentation, all that snazzy stuff. You can&rsquo;t help but wonder the logic of learning how to trade from someone trading with you at such a tenuous time, and wonder if you may have gotten a bit taken advantage of. Regardless, you absolutely can&rsquo;t argue with a mountain of food and a hearty </span><span class="c4 c5">pas rien, cousine!</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Whatever the hells that means.</span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12">Investment- </span><span class="c7 c4">Congratulations! The Outpost of Eparchy is completed! It was an easy task for the Onagi, and they finish with materials to spare. It has the following stats-</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Further due to the ease with which the Onagi built the place, your next Investment check to improve it will get a boost die.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12">Political- </span><span class="c7 c4">The duty of the Elpahka is to those they serve. Unlike lowlander kings who stand on the backs of their slaves, the Elpahka are the pillars that hold the Crag as one. When the Crag suffer, so do the Elpahka. If the Crag are dying, so must you die with them.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">The Elpahka descend from their pagodas and meditation chambers. They live among the common Crag, shoulder to shoulder, and do what they were born to do. They give hope to the living, comfort to the dying. They remind everyone that though the Path may seem to be crumbling, there </span><span class="c4 c5">is </span><span class="c7 c4">a Path. Though the next step is shrouded in fog, you still must put your foot forward and fall. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c12"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">They are the reason that the Crag are a people, and now in the very darkest weeks in anyone&#39;s memory, they prove it.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Other bloodlines may preserve the body of the Crag, but the Elpahka preserve the soul.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">It won&#39;t be forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c12"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12">Military-</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Despite the low morale, a little encouraging from the Elpahka seems to motivate the pathfinder expedition. The mission goes according to plan. The square scouted has the </span><span class="c4 c5">Riverhead</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c5">Lush Wetlands</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;Aspects. It could be a good location for a trading post for the river elves, or even some wetland farming of your own.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">That&#39;s not the most important thing. The Pathfinders come back with </span><span class="c4 c5">more</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;people than they left with.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Down in the lowlands, the pathfinders discovered a small shanty town of flimsy thatch buildings. In these buildings, shockingly, they found crag elves.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">These survivors, a few dozen people of mixed caste, report that they fled to hide out in the lowlands during the worst of the </span><span class="c16 c12 c22">Animal </span><span class="c4">purges. They have been in hiding, and report they are not the only ones. There are more groups hiding, both in the lowlands and in the high mountains. They may be able to return, if Eschaton is stable...</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">The Aggro have spent one of the two required turns of rest before they heal from.Heavy to Light casualties.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12">Mental- (Note</span><span class="c7 c4">: I am allowing Mysticism for this check due solely to the description of the First planning it in some kind of desperate drug fueled haze) Well, it wasn&#39;t easy but the plan for dirt farms has been carried out. It wasn&#39;t easy to convince the Crag that their hallowed architecture &nbsp;needed to be torn down and turned into a pit into which dirt and feces are thrown, but with a little convincing from the Elpahka leaders that were on your side for some reason it was enough.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">The dirt farms are temporary, but they will narrow the gap. When the blight is finally gone and it&#39;s time to start planting again, you&#39;ll have the best possible starting point </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">However this is not without cost. Between this and the quartzhouses, the damage to Eschaton&#39;s original architecture is extreme. It&#39;s barely recognizable anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">The </span><span class="c4 c5">Temple Ruins </span><span class="c4">Aspect has become </span><span class="c4 c5">Stripped Temple Ruins</span><span class="c7 c4">. Any usage of this Aspect in your favor will come with a setback die.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">A high cost for sure, but better than becoming a ghost town.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">--------</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">You are </span><span class="c14 c12">Slabal</span><span class="c7 c4">, and you are just now getting around to inspecting the last of the quartzhouses constructed in your absence. The workelfship is obviously excellent like the last few you inspected, but a duty is a duty. Besides, you can allow yourself a little bit of pride in the fact that this was your idea.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">The crops within are healthy, but few in number. A little confined by space, too. If you could refine the design, raise the ceiling some&hellip; you look off to the side and wonder about how long, exactly, you could make one of these. You could control the exact conditions in which even rare plants grow, you could control hybridization to a degree only dreamed about in the past. Why, with the combination of your heirloom varieties and perhaps some hardier&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">You stop yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">You aren&#39;t even thinking about the Blight anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">When was the last time </span><span class="c4 c5">that</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;happened?</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">-------</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">You are </span><span class="c14 c12">Saltik</span><span class="c7 c4">, and something has roused you from your fugue. Something you think may have been a dream. You stand from your darkened corner and leave your isolated room. You slowly walk the halls of the Circle, searching for the source. Eventually, you come upon a mess hall.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">A group of Aggro sit around a table, many still bearing the bandages and scars your hubris brought them. Before them is a plate piled high with what appears for all the world like a pile of dirty rocks. One of the Aggro timidly picks up one of the stones and twists it with a small utensil. As it pops open, you suddenly realize it is some kind of shelled creature. The animal inside the shell appears for all the world like a coin sized lump of phlegm. With an expression of trepidation, the Aggro holds the shell to his lips. He slurps down the yellowish flesh of the creature then slaps his hand over his mouth with a gagging nose before swallowing.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">The entire table bursts out into rowdy, raucous, unrestrained barking laughter, fists pounding on tables with mirth.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">That was it</span><span class="c4">, you think, </span><span class="c4 c5">that was real.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">The table falls silent as they see you standing at the door. For a few moments they do not know what to do.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">One of them pops open a bivalve and offers it to you.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">------</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">You are the </span><span class="c14 c12">First</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;and you are doing math. It&#39;s not the most glorious task, but a strictly necessary ones. Comforting as well. Numbers always act the same way.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">Of course, the trick is to use the </span><span class="c4 c5">right </span><span class="c7 c4">numbers. This is what you are currently trying to make sure you have done. You have accounted for every variable you can think of. The shipment of disgustingly bizarre lowlander food that was shockingly actually everything that was promised, the food from the quartzhouses, the food secured by the Aggro&#39;s sacrifice, the shipment of potatoes Slabal secured, the nonzero potential for a future shipment of potatoes, even the Esteemed&#39;s brew leaves.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">You compare these numbers- a Bakshish&#39;s warriors- against their opposing forces. How much food does an Aggro require per day. What if the Blight takes longer to die than expected. What if the first new harvest is less than expected. What if the weather is bad. What if your dirt farms produce the smallest projected amount of fertile soil.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">You throw everything you can think of at your little warriors. Every hardship you can possibly conjure. After days and days, after digging the absolute depths of what you can imagine, you are forced to the only remaining conclusion. You realize your hands are shaking as you permit yourself to finally believe it.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c4 c21 c5"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4 c5">Eschaton will survive.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">-------</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">You are </span><span class="c14 c12">Ledret</span><span class="c7 c4">, not the Esteemed. At least not in this moment. You have been away from your pagoda for days, guiding your people. Not from on high, but from among the common Onagi and Samra, encouraging them that hope is not far away. Which you definitely believed and weren&rsquo;t just trying to rearrange the carts in a collapsing mine. Definitely.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Now, however, Slabal has returned as the sun is setting. The carts of iron have been replaced with carts of food. Massive amounts of food, and what you are assuming is food like items. Strange river creatures, herbs and spices you don&rsquo;t recognize, what you hope are massive amounts of edible plants and roots. Not just basic supplies, but things to actually live with. It&rsquo;s an incredible bounty, more than you had hoped.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">Now, you sit quietly on top of your ox watching the food be distributed among your people. Grateful families weep with joy as they finally have enough to feed both themselves and their children. Neighbors rush to meet with each other to share what they have, a habit formed from necessity but now a celebration. You hear voices carrying on the familiar wind, from throughout the town.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">A cool evening breeze blows over Eschaton. It promises a future.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c14 c12">Event: The Blight</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12">Status: </span><span class="c7 c12 c30">Resolved</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c14 c12"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c14 c12">Due to the sheer tenacity (physical and mental) with which the Crag Elves withstood the blight, they receive a permanent upgrade to </span><span class="c14 c5 c12">one</span><span class="c12 c14">&nbsp;of the following skills:</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;Mysticism, Reconnaissance, or Recovery</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">There is one last thing.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">A young Samra named Padeck approaches the Esteemed Elpahka. He is one who returned with the pathfinders.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">He presents her with a small handful of pages he claims were transcribed from the </span><span class="c4 c5">Tome.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;He claims an unknown Bakshish copied as much of the </span><span class="c4 c5">Tome</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;as possible in the last purges and distributed them among fleeing refugees at random. He believed that if the Crag ever fully reunited the </span><span class="c4 c5">Tome</span><span class="c7 c4">&nbsp;might be remade.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">That remains to be seen. Padek does not know what other groups have pieces of the </span><span class="c4 c5">Tome </span><span class="c7 c4">or where they might be.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c4">But they are out there&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c4">-------</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c5">For the first time in many months, the homes and dining halls of the Crag are filled with topics other than hunger or want. &nbsp;Rather, the Crag discuss among themselves who, precisely, </span><span>resolved</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;said hunger and want. &nbsp;Each bloodline takes pride in what they have contributed, arguing that theirs was the most significant, or the most essential. &nbsp;It is well spirited, even joyous discussion, celebrating a rigorous trial that was skillfully passed. &nbsp;It is unfortunate that such discussion must turn sour.<br>The bitterness comes from the learned halls of the Bakshish, rumored to have come from the Mouth of the First himself; that while many wish to celebrate their contributions, there is one which must be </span><span>chided</span><span class="c21 c17 c5">. &nbsp;For, he allegedly said, if it was not for the ignorance of the Aggro, a solution to their want could have been discovered long ago. &nbsp;Had they but known what bounty could have been exploited in the overgrown lands in Eschaton&rsquo;s foothills, the Crag would have never known want. &nbsp;They would never have lacked. &nbsp;They would never have been exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c21 c17 c5">It is callous talk. &nbsp;Demeaning. &nbsp;Dangerous. &nbsp;Yet in spite of its unthinkable impropriety, it cannot help but take root. &nbsp;In time, there are few Crag who are unaware of the scope of the Aggro&rsquo;s failure. &nbsp;Were they not meant to be the ones who knew such savage lands? &nbsp;Was not their purview to be able to protect the Crag from its dangers? Were they not the ones who had spent so long in its verdant embrace? &nbsp;How could they have failed so?</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c5">And chief among those echoing these questions are the Halls of the Great Circle itself.<br></span><span class="c7 c17">How could we have failed so?</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span class="c21 c17 c5">The time for comforting ignorance has passed. &nbsp;Eschaton is exposed. &nbsp;The veil has been lifted.<br>The Aggro must not be found wanting.</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span>Motivated by shame, but buoyed by the success of some of their number, the Aggro look to those of their kind most suited to this new facet of their Responsibilities; their Stalkers. &nbsp;Though traditionally few in number, their talent in adapting to unusual and dreadful terrains must become a part of every Aggro&rsquo;s skillset. &nbsp;</span></p>
