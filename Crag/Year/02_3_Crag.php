</div><h2 class="c57" id="h.cur88z83k4v2"><span class="c31">Winter, Year 2</span></h2><p class="c27"><span class="c37 c44">ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">A thin wind wafts over the mountainpeaks. &nbsp;At this elevation, breathing becomes difficult, even for Crag. &nbsp;For all the pride you may have in the gifts granted you by The Path your ancestors trod, you are forced to concede mastery of these peaks to other creatures. &nbsp;Too bad for them that their overspecialization has left them vulnerable.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You can see them clearly, sitting in the rising sun. &nbsp;Squat. &nbsp;Massive. &nbsp;Their glassy eyes observe their surroundings, but don&rsquo;t search them; they are confident in their position in this food chain. No Fear.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You are the rocks. &nbsp;You are the boulders. &nbsp;You are the scree, the sleet, the gravel, the dust.<br>You are the whisper of air, the grit within, the slow force which silently erodes the mightiest mountains.<br>You are tension. &nbsp;The singing torque. &nbsp;You are the sharpened point.<br>You are killing intent.<br><br>Your quarry tilts its head, its bulbous eye looking straight at you, but still unseeing.<br>You are the correct moment.<br><br>The shaft springs from your bow, launching itself towards the presented weak point. Before it even lands, however, you have made yourself one with the terrain once more. &nbsp;A wet thud, a maddened screech, is all you need to hear to bring a wicked smile to your face.<br>You shift several feet to the side before peeking once again. &nbsp;Sure enough, your arrow is lodged firmly in what was once an eye, now just a ruptured tangle of flesh in a gaping socket. &nbsp;As you watch, two more shafts spring from its back. &nbsp;If your quarry were a prey creature, it and the rest of its knot would have already begun flight. &nbsp;Their confidence, their arrogant assumption of superiority, has now led to confusion. &nbsp;It is their ultimate downfall.<br>It turns, looking for the source of the pain in its back. &nbsp;Giving you a perfect line on the </span><span class="c19 c11">other</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;eyeball.<br>The impact of the second shaft sends it sprawling. &nbsp;Blind, pained, it thrashes out in all directions. &nbsp;A massive, rime-coated leg thrashes and strikes one of its number. &nbsp;This, finally, seems to be what sets the rest of your quarries into flight.<br>You stand. &nbsp;The time for stealth is over. &nbsp;<br><br>You fill your hand with shafts. &nbsp;Draw. Aim. Release. Draw. Aim. Release. Draw. Aim. Release.<br>By the time you fill your hand once more, the damage is done. &nbsp;More than a dozen arrows have sprouted among your targets in half as many seconds. &nbsp;The largest of their number, the one you blinded, still thrashes. &nbsp;Two others lie still.<br><br>You whistle into the wind. &nbsp;Let the rest run. &nbsp;This is more than enough for today.<br>You scramble down the mountainside. &nbsp;Your pace is sure, your movement unhindered. &nbsp;In one smooth, practiced motion, you draw your kuthe as you descend. &nbsp;<br><br>Your quarry is blind, but still dangerous. &nbsp;Its thrashing is not death throes, but a maddened attempt to lash out at anything, everything, that is within its reach. &nbsp;Its massive maw bites down on a helpless boulder, coating it with ice. &nbsp;<br><br>You leap upon the creature. &nbsp;Your flesh burns, a fierce, unyielding cold sapping the life from your skin. &nbsp;Your blood sings. &nbsp;The pain is distant, a nagging reminder rather than an urgent warning. &nbsp;You are alive.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Your kuthe bites deep in the creature&rsquo;s gut. &nbsp;It screams, maw turning to engulf you. <br>Perfect.<br>Your blow is quick. &nbsp;Precise. &nbsp;Through the roof of the mouth. &nbsp;Into the brain.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">It sags around you. &nbsp;Dead weight draping on top of you. &nbsp;Icy mucus coats you, further stinging your ice burns. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s no matter. &nbsp;No pain could outweigh the joy in your blood.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Sadly, your euphoria begins to fade. &nbsp;The hunt is done. &nbsp;Now, a far more onerous task remains. &nbsp;<br>Oh well. &nbsp;It was fun while it lasted.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You are </span><span class="c56 c32">Stalker Embebi</span><span class="c14">, and now that you and your small hunting detachment have finished tracking and killing your quarry, now you have to deal with the fact that you&rsquo;ve got three glacier toads to gut and clean, and unfortunately, these things are about 60% gut. &nbsp;<br>At least you don&rsquo;t have to do it alone. &nbsp;Jambor and Kirkov are already starting to work on the toads they felled. &nbsp;Juveniles, by the look of them, but Juvenile glacier toads are still nearly as big as a Crag. &nbsp;The one before you is twice your size, and probably four times your weight. &nbsp;And after you remove the inedible and poisonous parts, maybe it&rsquo;ll be only twice your weight. &nbsp;Thankfully, that&rsquo;s what the sled is for. &nbsp;You can drag that much, no problem.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You flip your lith from your belt. &nbsp;Time to get to work.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">More than an hour later, the three of you are finally plodding back into base camp, your spoils dragged behind you. &nbsp;Your return is noted by exclamations both excited and disappointed. &nbsp;Plenty of meat on a glacier toad, so everyone will sleep with full bellies tonight. &nbsp;Too bad the texture is like hard snot. &nbsp;Taste, not much better. &nbsp;You drop the sled to the side, leaving it for whatever poor soul has mess duty this rotation. &nbsp;You have other things to attend to.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19 c36">&ldquo;&lt;Attention! I&rsquo;m looking for Gustav. &nbsp;He has returned, yes?&gt;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c19 c36"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">One of those milling about, a young Crag tending to the fire, is the first to respond.<br></span><span class="c19 c47">&ldquo;&lt;Yes. &nbsp;He returned without incident. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s currently using the facilities.&gt;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c19 c47"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You give her a curt nod. &nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c36">&ldquo;&lt;When he&rsquo;s finished, tell him to head to the main tent. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll want to debrief him directly.&gt;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c19 c36"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">She nods back. &nbsp;Satisfied, you proceed to the aforementioned tent. &nbsp;&lsquo;Tent&rsquo; is a bit of a misnomer, in this case; it&rsquo;s more of a big tarp that keeps the snow off what few maps and notes you brought with you. &nbsp;Thankfully, the local terrain provides an abundance of paperweights. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You look over the etchings made of the local area. &nbsp;Sure enough, Gustav already left his new ones here. &nbsp;They paint much the same picture as all the other ones; Mountain, mountain, and more boring mountain.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You huff, your breath steaming from your nostrils. &nbsp;While the last few months have been, quite frankly, relaxing compared to all the unorthodox missions you&rsquo;ve had to deal with in recent times, you wish you had a little more to show for it. &nbsp;So far, this expedition has had few of the exciting surprises you had discovered on your last trip around the mountain. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t shake the nagging thought that it might be because there are some truths to the scandalous accusation leveled by the First Among Scholars; &nbsp;you don&rsquo;t entirely know </span><span class="c19 c11">what</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;you are looking for out here. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Well, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. &nbsp;You know what you&rsquo;re looking for&hellip; you&rsquo;re just concerned that some of the more subtle clues to find it might be escaping you.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You pick up one of the etchings. &nbsp;It seems to indicate a narrow pass, banded with colorful layers of metamorphic substrate, and rendered in fine detail; this shows a great deal of skill in the will of the etcher, &nbsp;but it&rsquo;s otherwise indistinguishable from the innumerable other passes you witnessed. &nbsp;You wonder what-</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Wait. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Close to the bottom of the pass&hellip; the walls narrow, except for a small entry point. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t fit with the rest of the pass&rsquo; shape. &nbsp;It almost looks like&hellip;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">&ldquo;It looks like it was willed, quiaff?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You </span><span class="c19 c11">very pointedly</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;do not jump, start, or otherwise react to the voice suddenly appearing in your ear. &nbsp;It would be unseemly. &nbsp;You do concede to cursing internally, however. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ninth hell claim him,&rdquo; it goes.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You turn around with all the grace you can muster, looking down at none other than Gustaf, your second for this venture. &nbsp;You look into his smug face. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s curious; he has somehow mastered the art of looking smug without smiling, tilting his eyebrows, or otherwise indulging in the typical symptoms of smugness. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s just somehow got a resting smug face. &nbsp;You have to admit, it impresses you.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Sometimes, you&rsquo;d counter smug with smug, but you think you&rsquo;ll let it pass in this instance. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re too curious about what it is he&rsquo;s found.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Aff. &nbsp;And a strong will, to boot. &nbsp;I was told your expedition was nonsit. &nbsp;So that must mean that you were uncertain about what this meant&hellip; or you planned on keeping this to yourself? Claim the challenge for yourself?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">&ldquo;I planned on keeping it to US, Stalkact. I wanted to make sure you had the opportunity to decide what to do without having to worry about&hellip; general opinion.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">...That&rsquo;s some concerning wording. &nbsp;That, and the fact that he&rsquo;s keeping to civlang. &nbsp;It means that whatever he wants to talk about, it&rsquo;s going to get complicated. &nbsp;It might even get political.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You purse your lips. You hate it when things get political.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What do you mean? What possible &lsquo;opinion&rsquo; could there be about a hole in a ravine? A hole is a hole.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">He closes his eyes, and shakes his head. &nbsp;You hate it when he does that. &nbsp;It means he&rsquo;s going to talk up at you. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve long suspected that there&rsquo;s likely a fair share of Bakshish lineage in him; it would explain his small (by your standards, anyway) stature, and also his general&hellip; know-it-all-itude. &nbsp;You wish you knew a better word for that.<br>As infuriating as that is, however, it&rsquo;s that general&hellip; knowiness?... that made you decide to make him your second. &nbsp;It might be difficult to work with, but ancestors condemn if it doesn&rsquo;t help get results.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">&ldquo;Stalkact, what I think we&rsquo;ve found here is incontrovertible proof of the direction that some of our wayward kin may have travelled. &nbsp;If they truly sheltered in that pass, then we know more than ever where they may be now; the ravine lets out in only one area, a few miles from here. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s any trace of their passage left, it will be our best chance to track them down.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19 c40">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">&ldquo;-That only sounds like good news. &nbsp;Why would you want to try to conceal that?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">His eyes tweak. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s frustrated, or sorrowful..</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">&ldquo;...I know one of our main objectives out here is to try to find those who may have fled from Eschaton, or perhaps even survived the death of one of the other settlements. &nbsp;But&hellip; to be fully frank, Stalkact, I question the wisdom of this objective.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You raise an eyebrow, but say nothing in return. &nbsp;He starts to look&hellip; worried? &nbsp;You&rsquo;re pretty sure that&rsquo;s worried.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">&ldquo;I mean, I just don&rsquo;t think that the Named may have really thought out the consequences. &nbsp;What if we do find them, but they&rsquo;ve expired? If we were too late? &nbsp;It would be a terrible blow to morale. &nbsp;It would be yet another failure to heap upon the recent mistakes that the others blame on the Aggro. &nbsp;The Named may have just unwittingly set you up to be yet another poor example.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You scoff. &nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c36">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous. &nbsp;I believe you are far overstating their reaction. &nbsp;All knew that when we started this expedition, there was a very likely chance that we would only find tragedy; &nbsp;Look at how difficult it was for those in Eschaton to survive in the wake of the Extermination. &nbsp;Poor souls out in the drifts would have a far more difficult prospect before them. &nbsp;In truth, until </span><span class="c10">we</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;discovered some of our number surviving in the lowlands, everyone had more or less written them off as dead already! &nbsp;I can see little logic in the other bloodlines accusing us for confirming their assumptions.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19 c40">&ldquo;... That is fair enough, Stalkact. &nbsp;But have you considered the consequences should we </span><span class="c19 c40 c11">succeed</span><span class="c17">?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c3">&ldquo;What? &nbsp;What nonsense talk is this? &nbsp;The consequences of being Named? &nbsp;I already am fully aware of the difficulties that such responsibility presents. &nbsp;I-&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">&ldquo;Neg, Stalkact. &nbsp;Not your Naming. &nbsp;The Consequences for Eschaton, should you succeed.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You furrow your brow. &nbsp;Now he&rsquo;s just talking in puzzles. &nbsp;And he&rsquo;s stopped explaining, instead just looking at you, waiting for a response he knows won&rsquo;t come.. &nbsp;You know what game he&rsquo;s playing, and refuse to play it. &nbsp; A coy smile winds onto your face.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, thinking of success, I had quite a successful hunt. &nbsp;I understand you&rsquo;ve become quite proficient in preparing toadflesh, quiaff? &nbsp;Perhaps you can give the Mess a hand, since it seems like you don&rsquo;t have any more to say.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Hah! He blanches at that. &nbsp;You even get a little lip curl for your troubles. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19 c40">&ldquo;Fine, fine. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll explain myself. &nbsp;Consider this, Stalkact. &nbsp;What if we find these wayward kin, and far from having perished, they have perhaps survived? &nbsp;Or even thrived? &nbsp;As you yourself pointed out, Eschaton has had difficulties aplenty surviving in the wake of the Extermination. &nbsp;If we were to further burden it with the untold number we may find, will it be able to bear the strain? &nbsp;Or what if they don&rsquo;t </span><span class="c19 c40 c11">want</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;to return? It&rsquo;s unheard of, but we&rsquo;ve encountered far stranger things as of late. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">There are any number of ways that our success at this mission could be even more of a tragedy than failure, Stalkact. &nbsp;I have no doubt that the Named intended well, but&hellip; I cannot shake the thought that perhaps this part of the mission, this search for the lost, may have been made in haste. &nbsp;I hate to speak it, but we have seen a fair share of that of late, as well.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c17">Which is why it may be in the best interest of all involved to&hellip; show patience and due consideration, in regard to this pass. &nbsp;After all, it may be nothing. &nbsp;An illusion of will. &nbsp;None would question you if you would decide to overlook it. &nbsp; Fewer still, if they were unaware that there was anything to overlook.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Fifth hell.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">There was a reason you decided to make Gustaf your second. &nbsp;This is the reason. &nbsp;That mind of his is twisted, but in all the right ways. &nbsp;He sees things, like this. &nbsp;Considers what no one else would consider considering. &nbsp;And best of all, he has the tenacity to speak of the unconsiderable. </span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">He isn&rsquo;t wrong. As in everything you have been caught up in lately, you tread on uncertain ground. &nbsp;No one has ever had to search for kin like this before. &nbsp;No one has had to an opportunity to consider the consequences of something like this. &nbsp;Certainly, the first re-integration occurred without notable issue, but one occurrence does not a pattern make. And the consequences of a fragment that would not want to re-integrate? &nbsp;A&hellip; a </span><span class="c19 c11">rebellious</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;splinter of kin? &nbsp;You can scarcely even put the thought into the right context. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s almost nonsensical.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You also know that he&rsquo;s right about the Named. &nbsp;This would not be the first action that they&rsquo;ve rushed into lately without considering all of the possible outcomes. &nbsp;Indeed, desperate for victories, they may have felt forced to commit to something, </span><span class="c19 c11">anything</span><span class="c14">, to try and prove their ability, to restore confidence.<br>You can&rsquo;t disagree. &nbsp;His logic is ironclad. &nbsp;It would be far wiser to wait on this, to fully consider the outcomes, to allow Eschaton, now barely just recovering, an opportunity to regain its footing before introducing any more wild variables.<br>The wisest course of action would be to fully consider this action, no matter how many days, weeks, even years it might take.<br></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">It takes you thirty seconds.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c3">&ldquo;OI! ATTEND! Stalkers, we&rsquo;ve got a prime lead on our wayward souls! I want three teams of our best trackers, ready to head out in the next hour! Grab Gear, Haul Rear, Aff?!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">The responding ACK, AFF echoes over the mountainsides, as two dozen Crag scramble from their duties to retrieve weapons, armor, and equipment. &nbsp;You look out over the action, pride and confidence swelling in your heart.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c3">&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re right, Gustaf. &nbsp;It would have been far wiser to wait. &nbsp;Which is why we can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Only Aggro would be so foolish as to attempt such an audacious action. &nbsp;Only Aggro will save those souls.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You turn to look at him, only to find that there&rsquo;s nothing to look at. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s nowhere to be seen.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">-How in the fourth hell does he </span><span class="c19 c11">do</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;that?</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;...two fires to concentrate, then an earth to calcinate. &nbsp;Integrate into the previous solution, and add air to cavitate. &nbsp;Aqua Regia.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">The click and klack of stone tiles echo in the cave. &nbsp;A frustrated groan is quick to join them.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;Of </span><span class="c15 c11">course</span><span class="c12">. &nbsp;Naturally, once again, the fates play favorites.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Says you. &nbsp;Fate is for those without a plan. &nbsp;There is no fate but what you studiously prepare for.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c12">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can studiously prepare for crap draws. &nbsp;Is that all, or do you have another dozen operations?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">The soft rustle of a leather pouch, filled with similar stone tiles. &nbsp;A desperate, pleading search. &nbsp;A defeated growl.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c12">&ldquo;Of course. &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;Can&rsquo;t even keep Reducing with this!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c43">&ldquo;What, seriously? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got that big pile, and nothing to use for fuel? I call nonsense.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m just griping as a jape. &nbsp;Hah Hah. Let me just pull my fuel from the </span><span class="c15 c11">other</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;worthless pile! &nbsp;Guess I should have </span><span class="c15 c11">planned</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;to go the whole time with my pilot sputtering, huh?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Ignore her, Drivel. &nbsp;She drew, so it&rsquo;s your go now. &ldquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c20 c19">&ldquo;Well&hellip; Uh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">A shuffling of tiles. &nbsp;Audible indecision.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Ignore her&rsquo;! Offer&rsquo;s still on the table, Drivel. &nbsp;I just need the one charcoal, so I can keep reducing! I promise I can give you pretty much </span><span class="c15 c11">anything else</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;on my turn in return! Look, I don&rsquo;t even need the whole charcoal, just a fire would suffice!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c20 c19">&ldquo;Hrm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c43">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Drivel. &nbsp;Remember yesterday? &nbsp;Rasper&rsquo;s nothing but a scorpion.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c12">&ldquo;Go swallow some ink, Walter. &nbsp;That was just a coincidence. Come on, Drivel. &nbsp;Just one fire.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c20 c19">&ldquo;...Do you think I could get some xanthum in return?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Dammit, Drivel, she can&rsquo;t tell you that! You can&rsquo;t say what&rsquo;s in your lab!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19 c46">&ldquo;Hey! I didn&rsquo;t ask if she </span><span class="c19 c46 c11">had</span><span class="c19 c46">&nbsp;xanthum, just if she thought she could give me what I&rsquo;d </span><span class="c19 c46 c11">need</span><span class="c20 c19">&nbsp;to make xanthum!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Oh, come off it! That&rsquo;s the same thing!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c43">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s technically different. &nbsp;I mean, otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to ask for anything, right?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;Right! Look, Drivel, I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c15 c11">pretty sure</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;I can get you </span><span class="c15 c11">swimming </span><span class="c15">in xanthum. &nbsp;And all I need is the </span><span class="c15 c11">one</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;fire. &nbsp;You know that&rsquo;s a good deal.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c20 c19">&ldquo;Yeah! Yeah, okay. &nbsp;Tile to you. &nbsp;As for me&hellip; Uh&hellip; I guess two earths to mixture to Occlude, then a fire to the pilot to Reduce?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Click. &nbsp;Tick Clak. &nbsp;Hesitant placement. A slight tremble.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c43">&ldquo;Three earths, two air, add to the iosate. Water to Dilute. &nbsp;Mercury. &nbsp;Your go.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">Tak, tak, tak, tak. &nbsp;Confident, certain.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll draw.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Shuf, shuf. &nbsp;A thoughtful hum.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Okay, go ahead.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;Hokay, so.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span><span class="c14">A slight warble to the voice. &nbsp;Giddy anticipation.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;First, earth and fire. &nbsp;Charcoal. &nbsp; Three earth, three water, mix, Charcoal to Pilot, Reduce. &nbsp;Leucosate.<br></span><span class="c15 c11">Then</span><span class="c12">, two more earth, two air, put to pestle, air to grind. &nbsp;Add water, air to grind. &nbsp;Two xanthum. &nbsp;One to Drivel.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c20 c19">&ldquo;Thanks! &nbsp;Okay, I&rsquo;ll-&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;Ah ah ah! Not done yet! </span><span class="c15 c11">Then</span><span class="c15">, two fire, three air, </span><span class="c15 c11">and</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;an alembic! Put to the pilot, use the second reduce of the charcoal, Iosate!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Oh, first hell.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c43">&ldquo;Told you. &nbsp;A scorpion.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;A </span><span class="c15 c11">victorious</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;scorpion. &nbsp;Leucosate, xanthum, iosate all back into the flask. &nbsp;And finally&hellip; pure melanite.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c42 c56">&ldquo;</span><span class="c42 c56">Fuck you</span><span class="c41 c42">.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c12">&ldquo;Melanite into the flask. &nbsp;Prima Materia. &nbsp;Final reduce of the charcoal. &nbsp;Philosopher&rsquo;s stone. &nbsp;Victory.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c20 c19">&ldquo;...Sorry, guys.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c43 c56">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Drivel. &nbsp;I have no idea why we play this game, anyway.&rdquo;<br></span><span class="c15">&ldquo;Uh, because it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c15 c11">Great?</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;What other game lets you win like this?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;I dunno, a good one?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c12">&ldquo;Wah, wah. &nbsp;Infant wants his cladekeeper to dress his hurt pride!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;I am about five seconds away from shoving that tilebag up your ass.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c43">&ldquo;Gross.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c41 c43"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You smile. &nbsp;Ancestors help you, you can&rsquo;t help it. &nbsp;<br>Sure, they&rsquo;re wasting time, and in theory that should annoy the shit out of you, but, if you&rsquo;re being really honest with yourself&hellip; it&rsquo;s relaxing. &nbsp;Familiar. &nbsp;It reminds you of simpler times. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You are </span><span class="c32 c56">Renyan</span><span class="c19">, and you are currently putting the finishing touches on your notes regarding the cave that you&rsquo;ve called&hellip; well, not exactly home, but definitely your workspace for the past several months. &nbsp;You wish that you could say they were more </span><span class="c19 c11">productive</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;months. &nbsp;The fact that you&rsquo;ve effectively burnt a whole season on figuring out a cantrip is both a point of abject frustration and also small pride. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll grant that it&rsquo;s largely useless information&hellip; but it&rsquo;s largely useless information that </span><span class="c19 c11">no one else could figure out.</span><span class="c14">&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">Not that you can really blame your hand-picked crew for not being able to handle it. &nbsp;You mean, you didn&rsquo;t exactly pick them for their in-depth knowledge of orison minutia. &nbsp;Your selection criteria was based a lot more on mental flexibility, open perspectives, and whether or not they bugged the shit out of you. &nbsp;They were able to do their fair share in the beginning, but when shit got real, they became little more than glorified lab assistants&hellip; which is a role they pursued without complaint, argument, or apathy. &nbsp;The fact that you had an opportunity to work with people who would actually </span><span class="c19 c11">listen</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;to you went a long way to being able to crack this puzzle&hellip; even if the puzzle itself was largely worthless.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">So, you know. &nbsp;Pluses and minuses.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">However, the biggest plus? Really? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the fact that in the last three to four months, </span><span class="c19 c11">no one has threatened to strangle you.</span><span class="c14">&nbsp; </span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">...You may need to reevaluate some of your life choices.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">And speaking of.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Sadly, it&rsquo;s time for you to leave this site. &nbsp;Now that you know the origin of the only magic used in this ritual, it might be possible to glean a little more information from it, but you&rsquo;re going to have to leave that to your team; you&rsquo;ve been away from Eschaton too long as it is, and you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised if your office hasn&rsquo;t been firebombed by the time you get back. &nbsp;Or if the Learned Hall hasn&rsquo;t caught fire. &nbsp;Or the Auditorium. &nbsp;You&rsquo;d be pretty okay if the Philosopher&rsquo;s Bistro caught fire. &nbsp;That place has needed renovation for nearly a hundred years now.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Anyway.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Final note placed, you slam your folio shut, the echoing SLAP managing to interrupt the argument/incipient slap fight. &nbsp;You turn around, trying to wipe the smile off your face, and only succeed partially. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c19 c35">&ldquo;So, if you&rsquo;re all done playing your </span><span class="c19 c35 c11">Juvenile&rsquo;s Tile Games</span><span class="c24 c19">, I have an announcement to make.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">To your immense satisfaction, they actually stand up and at attention, their body language signaling both attentiveness </span><span class="c19 c11">and</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;respect!</span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c19 c35">&ldquo;While I am of course </span><span class="c19 c35 c11">thrilled</span><span class="c19 c35">&nbsp;by the progress we&rsquo;ve managed to make in cracking whatever perverse, insane ritual was conducted here, I&rsquo;m afraid that spending six fortnights to uncover one orison isn&rsquo;t exactly a wise use of my incredibly precious time. &nbsp;While I have no doubt that there are countless other discoveries to be made in the light of this momentous epiphany, I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll have to be </span><span class="c19 c35 c11">your</span><span class="c24 c19">&nbsp;responsibility.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Ah, there are the nervous looks. &nbsp;And well they should be! &nbsp;They needed your massive intellect to discover the one concrete piece of information here, and even that was taxing in the extreme. &nbsp;Without you, they&rsquo;re practically helpless.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c43">&ldquo;Pardon me, First, but I hope I can request some clarification?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c19 c25"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You raise one of your bushy eyebrows.</span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c24 c19">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly surprising. &nbsp;Well, Trasey, out with it.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c24 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c25 c19">&ldquo;Supposing there actually is anything more to discover here, do you have a method in mind to continue to keep the workers of Eparchy in the dark? &nbsp;While we&rsquo;ve managed to justify our presence here with the couple of mineral seams that Rasper was able to locate, I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s nothing else in the area&hellip; and I&rsquo;m reasonably confident that the Samra will figure that out sooner or later. &ldquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c41 c43"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Try as you might, you just can&rsquo;t keep a smug smile from crawling onto your face. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also nice to have people ask questions that you&rsquo;ve got an answer to.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c24 c19">&ldquo;Ah, the answer to that is quite simple. &nbsp;When I return to Eparchy, I plan to inform them that, while conducting our mineral surveys, we&rsquo;ve managed to find this odd cave that is filled with some kind of perverse ritual! &nbsp;The fact that we need to investigate this odd discovery to see if it&rsquo;s of any threat to Eschaton should provide more than enough justification for you to stay here.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c24 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c42">&ldquo;Wait, so&hellip; we&rsquo;re going to tell them the truth?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c41 c42"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c19 c35">&ldquo;Well, specifically, </span><span class="c19 c35 c11">I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c19 c35">going to tell them the truth, although I&rsquo;ll probably fudge the dates a little. &nbsp;Look, the reason I insisted on secrecy in the first place was to avoid a panic. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s one thing that we&rsquo;ve discovered in our last season here, other than trivial</span><span class="c19 c35 c48">orison</span><span class="c19 c35 c52">minutia</span><span class="c24 c19">, &nbsp;it&rsquo;s that for all its creepiness, this cave is currently effectively harmless. &nbsp;No sinister glow, no necrotic pulses, not even a good old fashioned death curse&hellip; at least, not unless it&rsquo;s a really slow one. &nbsp;Hrm.</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c24 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c19 c35">In any case, even though the truth of its presence might create a </span><span class="c19 c11 c35">small</span><span class="c24 c19">&nbsp;panic, that will be quickly salved by the knowledge that the Finest Minds are working on it tirelessly, and so far have discovered no immediate threat.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c24 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c15">&ldquo;Of course! &nbsp;And, should it at any point </span><span class="c15 c11">become</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;threatening, those same minds will have put a plan into place to systematically destroy the ritual chamber, ensuring that no harm can come to the Crag People!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c12"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c24 c19">&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course! I would expect no less. &nbsp;Now, while I expect you are more than capable of seeing to the distribution of labor yourselves, I think it would be wise to appoint one of you to be the Chief Researcher on the project. &nbsp;After all, it never hurts to have a clear chain of authority! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve thought long and hard on who is the best choice for this role, and after much deliberation, I&rsquo;ve decided upon&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c24 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You make a theatrical flourish with your hand. &nbsp;You just can&rsquo;t help yourself.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c24 c19">&ldquo;Drivel!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c19 c24"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Hah! That got the reaction you expected. &nbsp;Especially from Drivel.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c20 c19">&ldquo;M-Me? &nbsp;Chief Researcher? B-but-&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c19 c20"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c24 c19">&ldquo;Of course! Of all of you, Drivel has by far been the most diligent in maintaining his notes, keeping accurate timecards, and ensuring that every responsibility he was given was completed in a timely, efficient manner. &nbsp;While all of you may have your own specialties and fields, this peerless dedication to the most fundamental virtue of our bloodline, accurate record keeping, has thoroughly impressed me! &nbsp;I am certain that under his guidance, no stone will be left unturned, and no stone turning will be left undocumented!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="c8"><span class="c14">These statements are almost 100% lies. </span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">It is </span><span class="c19 c11">partially </span><span class="c19">true that Drivel&rsquo;s notes and recordings are&hellip; adequate&hellip; but the real reason for choosing such an obvious underdog&hellip; is that he&rsquo;s an obvious underdog. &nbsp;<br>Bakshish, as you have learned from a long, hard life of being one, are innately competitive, ambitious, and driven&hellip; up until they get fat and complacent, anyway. &nbsp;But before then, one of the quickest ways to obtain recognition and status is by standing on the backs of your fellows&hellip; ancestors know that you put more than your share under your heel. <br>However, given the number of&hellip; ahem&hellip; </span><span class="c19 c11">clandestine truths</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;that were involved in this study, leaving it in the hands of one of the more capable of their number could almost certainly cause you problems&hellip; after all, they have the perfect leverage, ready and on hand. &nbsp;Put someone who can barely keep their head above water, however, and they&rsquo;ll spend so much time fending off the ambitions of those below them that they can scarcely </span><span class="c19 c11">think</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;about how to use that time to get one over on those above them.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">And who knows? &nbsp;Sometimes, when put under pressure, underdogs like that will surprise you.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">It certainly surprised Sivens.</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You are </span><span class="c56 c32">Drivel</span><span class="c14">. &nbsp;Apparently, now Chief Researcher Drivel.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Elematich-sensei noticed you.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">This makes your kokoro go doki-doki.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">Because you are </span><span class="c7 c19 c22">completely screwed.</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Step forward. &nbsp;Place measure.<br>Divot. Divot.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Recheck measure. &nbsp;Turn measure ninety degrees.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Divot. &nbsp;Divot.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Recheck measure. <br>Connect the divots. &nbsp;At the intersecting corners, place the marker pegs.<br>Recheck the measure. &nbsp;Turn the measure ninety degrees. &nbsp;Recheck the measure.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Nod to the slablayers.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Step forward.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">This has been your experiences for the last three hours of the day.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">It is singularly fulfilling.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You are </span><span class="c56 c32">Slabal</span><span class="c19">, and, although you have long held the title of &nbsp;Layer of the Path, in practice, most of the time your duties required you to repair, maintain, or, at the most extreme, </span><span class="c19 c11">re</span><span class="c14">-lay a path.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">This is the first time you have actually, literally laid out a completely new, entirely original path.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">The path in question lies at the heart of what is, in your opinion, one of your greatest achievements. &nbsp;The Main Way of Eparchy, a broad, straight, entirely efficient thoroughfare allowing elegant transit of materials from the largest excavation site currently laid, to any number of current, or future, or even theoretical warehouses, extraction refineries, smelteries, bloomeries, and so forth. &nbsp;It is designed with the future in mind; although it&rsquo;s capacity currently dwarfs the trickle of cart and Samra traffic that trace its steps, it will ensure that as Eparchy grows in size and utility, it will not want for a well regulated, well lain, and well planned main broadway.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You can confidently state that you feel pretty satisfied with it.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Today, you mark the final placement of slabs which will currently define the &ldquo;limits&rdquo; of Eparchy, for want of a better word. &nbsp;Although said limits bear little true meaning, considering its lack of walls, towers, or other defensive measures, it seems an apt point at which you must conclude that your foundational work with the outpost is complete. &nbsp;It is a task that you pursue with an odd mixture of anticipation and trepidation. &nbsp;While the thought of completing this task, concluding such a monumental achievement, is enticing, it cannot help but be tempered by the knowledge that once this task is done, another will lay before it&hellip; and, while you are not perfectly certain of what that task may be, you suspect that it may not be as simple and peacefully fulfilling as this one.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Oh well. &nbsp;It is not as if delaying in this project would actually help matters.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Hours pass. &nbsp;The sun rises overhead, and then begins to dip to the horizon. &nbsp;And still, you follow the pattern.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Divot. &nbsp;Divot.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Recheck measure.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Connect the Divots.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">However, the final moment has come. &nbsp;This time, when you nod to the slablayers, you do not step forward. &nbsp;Instead, you watch as they pull the final slab from the cart. &nbsp;Willed from quarried granite, separated into slabs connected by thin sprues, then separated, filed to exact measurements, and polished, they will endure footsteps, sleds, cartwheels and more for many centuries of wear before replacements will be required. &nbsp;<br>Laid in place, it is a near perfect fit, only an almost-invisible seam separating it from its sister slabs. &nbsp;While it is possible that even these seams could be removed by simply willing the slabs together, leaving them separate in this fashion is more desirable; it will give the material freedom to expand and contract with the shifting temperatures. &nbsp;That is, after all, why you waited until now, when the temperature had cooled to its lowest average, to undertake this final task. &nbsp;It was simply more efficient this way. &nbsp;Not procrastination.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Hrm. &nbsp;You may be a bit overly defensive about that. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c39 c19">&ldquo;A task well completed. &nbsp;The main way is complete, for now. &nbsp;It will require final inspection, but all preliminary inspection indicates that it is of the finest craftelfship. &nbsp;Karlos, you are to be commended with full emphasis for the diligence of you and your laborers. &nbsp;Entrep, your work in accurately levelling the way&rsquo;s foundation is also to be praised. &nbsp;Congratulations to all.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Eyes brighten. &nbsp;In a few cases, smiles even sprout. &nbsp;It is, perhaps, overly exuberant, but you can understand their passion. &nbsp;This was a major undertaking, and a vital one.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c39 c19">&ldquo;I believe it would serve to commemorate this work by concluding this work day early. &nbsp;An additional shift of recreation and repast to you all. &nbsp;Entrep, if you would attend, I wish to speak with you before you go to join them.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">At your words, the assembled Crag, both laborers and craftselves alike, fan out to the other parts of Eparchy. &nbsp;Within the bunks and halls already previously erected, you suspect that soon cookfires will ignite and conversation will rise. &nbsp;One of their number, Entrep, remains as requested. &nbsp;Her wizened features belay her age; by no means even close to as aged as the Esteemed, she still shows those subtle marks of seniority that all Onagi hope to one day cultivate. &nbsp;They are marks of wisdom. &nbsp;Marks of experience.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c23 c19">&ldquo;A path well laid, Layer. &nbsp;Heh. &nbsp;It always sounds odd, to repeat myself like that. &nbsp;Jocularity aside, I assume there are other tasks which now require our attention?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c23 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c39 c19">&ldquo;In truth, I wish I could say they require our attention, Entrep. &nbsp;For myself, however, I must, for now, consider this project the last one which I undertake for the sake of erecting Eparchy. &nbsp;I do not believe my time is well spent providing further guidance; every concern and need seems to be placed in well capable hands, and my interference could brook little improvement.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">She nods deeply to you, the motion allowing her long hair to tumble over her shoulders. </span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c23 c19">&ldquo;As you say, Layer, although I fear you do yourself a disservice. &nbsp;I have no doubt that your masterful eye and keen insight could serve us further. &nbsp;However, I understand the nature of your words; while Eparchy is grand for its scale, the sad truth is that said scale pales to greater trails which prevail, yes? I cannot disagree. &nbsp;Your talents were meant to be spent on greater events.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c23 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You return the nod- not as deeply, as is correct for your relative positions. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c39 c19">&ldquo;That is an apt summary, Entrep. &nbsp;While Eparchy claimed priority for its essential position in our established&hellip; trade, with the Otherelves, now I must redirect my efforts elsewhere. &nbsp;The Esteemed has made our ultimate priorities clear. &nbsp;Eschaton must be prepared.</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">She smiles with her eyes. &nbsp;You have difficulty parsing whether that variety of smile is specifically joyous, coy, or conspiratory.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c23 c19">&ldquo;Ah, yes, a New Generation! &nbsp;Always an exciting time. &nbsp;I hope you will forgive my curious probing, but will it be your first?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c23 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c39 c19">&ldquo;No. &nbsp;It will possibly be my first successful one, however. &nbsp;I was part of the Bloodied Generation.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">She blanches. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c23 c19">&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;My apologies, Layer. &nbsp; I should have not-&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c23 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">Internally, you chide yourself. &nbsp;You could have handled that exchange more delicately. &nbsp;You forgot how sensitive some can be about how sensitive they need to be. &nbsp;It is a frustrating concept.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c23 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c19 c39">&ldquo;There is nothing to be gained in your apologies. &nbsp;You are not at fault. &nbsp;No forgiveness is required. &nbsp;I believe you have made yourself familiar with the currently planned expansion of the corundum warehousing?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Admirably, she recovers quickly from her apparent gaffe.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19 c23">&ldquo;Of course, layer. &nbsp;Thanks to an unanticipated deposit, it will be necessary to place priority on those over the previously prioritized bloomery expansion.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c23 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c39 c19">&ldquo;Then you are as up to date on the projects I had a part in as you can be. &nbsp;I have little more insight to provide that you are not capable of deducing yourself. &nbsp;I have witnessed your capabilities, Entrep, and I can confidently state that you will likely be capable of handling any further adjustments or expansions for the near future. &nbsp;As this project is still in a fairly nascent stage, I will likely feel inclined to inspect it regularly; Perhaps every year or two, &nbsp;depending on present workload, but otherwise, I see no reason to not leave it in your capable hands.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">She nods deeply again.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c23 c19">&ldquo;You honor me, Layer. &nbsp;I will do all I can to plan make this land great in its span. &nbsp;I feel I must prove your trust just. &nbsp;I will brook no malarky in regards to Eparchy.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c23 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c39 c19">&ldquo;...Yes. &nbsp;Good. &nbsp;I appreciate your time, Entrep. You can join the others, if you wish.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c39 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Gracefully, she turns, heading towards one of the halls where the Onagi congregate. &nbsp;You consider following her, but upon reflection, see no real reason to. &nbsp;If you were to set out now, &nbsp;you would likely be able to arrive back in Eschaton before the week is concluded. &nbsp;That would allow you to begin organizing things straightaway. The sooner you can entrench yourself in projects, the better. &nbsp;Better for Eschaton. &nbsp;Better for its people.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">And, if you are being totally honest, better for yourself, if your plan works.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Once more, you find your hand tracing to the inner pocket where the elegant blade of copper rests. &nbsp;You extract it, considering in the dimming sunlight.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">It was a considerable surprise when the feather first began to speak to you. &nbsp;In spite of what the unusually tall Otherelf said, you didn&rsquo;t truly expect it would be capable of the purpose he claimed. &nbsp;That expectation was wildly subverted when it abruptly began barking about spies, &lsquo;wolf elves&rsquo;, and poisons in one of those odd lowlander patois. </span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Since then, you have kept careful track of its communications; although the ramblings you have seen so far have little meaning or context to you, it was the most recent one which actually sparked your concerns about how long you had spent in Eparchy.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c56 c32">&ldquo;The Triumvirate cordially invites all to the annual Potluck,&rdquo;</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;it said, </span><span class="c22 c32 c41">&ldquo;at Surt this upcoming New Year.&quot;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">The Potluck. &nbsp;The thought of it brings uncomfortable trepidation to the fore of your mind. &nbsp;You had remembered that they said it was to be held annually, but the truth of how rapidly that would come had not really sunk in until you had received that message.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Hence, your current haste. &nbsp;Your plan is simple, and perhaps only marginally likely to succeed. &nbsp;But, if performed correctly, you sincerely consider that it would be in the best interests of all involved.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">By returning to Eschaton, by immersing yourself in labors and projects, by working furiously to make Eschaton grander, stronger, sturdier, and, most importantly, by making yourself integral to their success&hellip;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Then perhaps the Esteemed won&rsquo;t make you go again.</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Your bones ache.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19"><br>In and of itself, this is nothing new; you&rsquo;ve been dealing with some form of arthritic pain for nearly half a century. &nbsp;No, the reason it bears mentioning right now is the </span><span class="c19 c11">novelty</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;of your bone ache. &nbsp;You had not expected that you would be able to feel your skull ache.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Not your brain, mind you. &nbsp;Nor your sinuses. &nbsp;Nor your ocular cavities. &nbsp;You are well accustomed to the causes of those pains. &nbsp;This is something entirely new. &nbsp;This is your literal skull, the headbones themselves, aching for reasons you can scarcely fathom.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">You are </span><span class="c56 c32">The Esteemed</span><span class="c14">, and with every passing day, with every passing minute, you are getting progressively too old for this.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">Thankfully, a distraction presents itself. &nbsp;Someone is climbing the stairs. &nbsp;In better circumstances, you&rsquo;d try to guess who they were based on pace, trod, and other telltale signs that you use to pinpoint individuals. &nbsp;For right now, just being able to concentrate on the sound of foot against stone is enough to distract you from your traitorous skeleton. &nbsp;<br>Besides, you scarcely have to guess, in this circumstance. &nbsp;It is high noon, and the middle of the week. &nbsp;That means it&rsquo;s&hellip;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c51">&ldquo;Esteemed Ledret Blakenova. &nbsp;I am Hercus Wortenich. &nbsp;I have come to report.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c41 c50"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c19">Exactly on schedule. &nbsp;Your daily dose of bad news. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c19 c34"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c26 c19">&ldquo;I recognize you, Hercus Wortenich. &nbsp;You are worthy and capable to speak with the Voice of Eschaton. &nbsp;Tell me, what does Eschaton wish to be known?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c26 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You, of course, already know what the answer is going to be. &nbsp;But ritual is important. &nbsp;Tradition is important. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s what ties us to the past. &nbsp;In better times, that tie shows us how to move forward. &nbsp;Nowadays, you&rsquo;d be satisfied with returning back.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c51">&ldquo;Eschaton speaks, and I am its tongue. &nbsp;It wishes it known; All is Well.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c41 c51"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c14">You barely stifle a gasp. &nbsp;Your breath hitches in your throat. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c26 c19">&ldquo;...All is Well?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c19 c26"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c41 c51">&ldquo;All is Well.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c41 c51"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">All is Well. &nbsp;Time was, that this message was all that the Ritual of Report brought. &nbsp;It was never meant to be in-depth, or detailed; there were innumerable other functionaries and managers responsible for keeping track of such minutia, and either handling it, or reporting it. &nbsp;The Voice of Eschaton, however, spoke for the whole of the Settlement. &nbsp;The wellbeing of Eschaton itself. &nbsp;For hundreds of years, the Voice of Eschaton&rsquo;s sole purpose was to echo this wellbeing, with a simple phrase: &ldquo;All is Well.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c18"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">You have not heard that phrase since the Extermination came.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c18"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">Tears spring to your eyes. &nbsp;Unbidden. &nbsp;Unwanted. &nbsp;Yet, there all the same. A symptom of survival.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">You turn your face to the wind, to better hide their appearance.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c18"></span></p> 
<p class="c9"><span class="c26 c19">&ldquo;...All is Well. &nbsp;The Voice is Heard.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c9 c30"><span class="c26 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">You can hear Hercus&rsquo; footsteps receding into the distance. &nbsp;Yet, though their cause has gone, the tears will not stop. &nbsp;You do not wail. &nbsp;You do not snivel or burble, like a child. &nbsp;But for all your poise, all your control, you cannot stop the tears.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c18"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c45 c59">A small part of you hopes they will </span><span class="c6">never</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;stop.</span></p> 
<p class="c1"><span class="c18"></span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">Even in the depths of winter, a Fair Wind blows over the mountainside. &nbsp;It promises reprieve.</span></p>

<p class="c8"><span class="c18">Unfortunately, here, it&rsquo;s a harbinger of a cruel truth.</span></p>

Your little expedition was fun, but now it&rsquo;s back to the necessary duties. &nbsp;You must follow the Esteemed&rsquo;s priorities, after all.<br>But, damn your massive brain, if there wasn&rsquo;t something about those priorities that had been nagging at you. &nbsp;Some hidden concern. &nbsp;Something that didn&rsquo;t quite add up.<br>Finally, you figured it out. &nbsp;And what you ultimately concluded could largely invalidate everything you&rsquo;ve put together so far. &nbsp;Hence&hellip; the Postscript. An ugly, portentous semicolon beneath your hard work.</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">You eye the flask on your nightstand. &nbsp;When you were in close company of your handpicked number, you had moderated yourself. &nbsp;Provide a good example and all. &nbsp;It was difficult, but you found ways to substitute for your cravings. &nbsp;Most of the time. &nbsp;Now, however, you can feel it&rsquo;s pull, all the stronger for its former absence. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c8"><span class="c18">You rub your temples. Your eyes ache. &nbsp;Your fingers are stained with ink. &nbsp;These things might be related.</span></p>

<p class="c27"><span class="c32">Political</span><span>: </span><span class="c11">All is well. &nbsp;For the first time in many months, the Elpahka do not need to carefully balance and measure to ensure that Eschaton itself does not expire. Finally, they can recover from recovery. &nbsp;However, unlike earlier, there is no wise reason to remain entirely idle; while they were focused on survival, it is clear to many that the Elpahka have lost some measure of the control and concern that is their Responsibility. &nbsp;It far past time to settle that.</span></p> 
<p class="c27"><span>Attempting to use the </span><span class="c32">Spycraft(Cloak and Dagger)</span><span>&nbsp;skill, to represent various Elpahka once more concerning themselves with the everyday plans and procedures of the various bloodlines; it is clear that they have been turning a blind eye for too long. &nbsp;To this end, they will utilize the stunt </span><span class="c11">The Hills Have Eyes</span><span>, communing with the stones of Eschaton to see what details have been missed. &nbsp;While intended to discover the hidden secrets of their own people, there is a non-zero chance that something else could be discovered alongside it.</span></p> 
<p class="c13"><span class="c7 c22 c33"></span></p> 
<p class="c27"><span class="c32">Military: </span><span class="c11">The Hunt is on! Although the clues are thus far few and far between, Embebi is not about to let that deter them; indeed, she seems more driven than ever, motivated to put falsehood to the concerns of her Second. &nbsp;In spite of said objections, however, Gustaf is right there, driving them beside her; it is almost as if he </span><span>intended</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;to spur this passionate response.</span></p> 
<p class="c27"><span>Attempting to use the </span><span class="c32">Reconnaissance(Rangers)</span><span>&nbsp;skill to follow up on the tracks of potential wayward kin. &nbsp;As these tracks were spotted in the Mountains, once again, the stunt </span><span class="c11">The Stone is our Home</span><span>&nbsp;applies. &nbsp;Additionally, Embebi&rsquo;s passion to prove that saving all Crag, any Crag, and returning them to Eschaton can never be in error </span><span class="c11">Invokes</span><span>&nbsp; the aspect </span><span class="c11 c32">We Are Uncut</span><span class="c11">. </span><span>&nbsp;This allows her to spend a Fate Point to once again gain another Proficiency die on her attempts.</span></p> 
<p class="c13"><span class="c7 c33 c22"></span></p> 
<p class="c27"><span class="c32">Mental:</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;While The First has returned to Eschaton, and has engaged in essential, and apparently potentially doomed, research, the unfortunate truth is that said research is also fundamentally </span><span>boring</span><span class="c11">(if a bit cliffhangery)</span><span>.</span><span class="c7 c33 c22">&nbsp; The REAL excitement has landed directly on the head of poor, unprepared Drivel, who must now attempt to use what few clues were left behind to attempt to justify the position he was left with. &nbsp;Currently, he only sees one potential avenue; now that they know that the sole magical portion of the ritual was decidedly Divine, he will have to use all the lore, both Ancient and Recent, at his disposal to attempt to identify the guilty parties.<br>He has few doubts that he is utterly screwed.</span></p> 
<p class="c27"><span>Attempting to use the </span><span class="c32">Spirituality(Research)</span><span>&nbsp;skill to investigate in a new direction; not </span><span class="c11">what</span><span>&nbsp;the ritual is, but </span><span class="c11">who</span><span class="c21">&nbsp;might use a ritual like this. &nbsp;While the broad answer is obvious, it may be possible to use what they have learned about the nature of the ritual to determine the specific cult, order, inquisition, or what have you responsible; while few of the Bakshish would deign to consider themselves &ldquo;experts&rdquo; on such a heinous subject, there are always recovered scraps and those perverse few(one of which is among the handpicked number) which may be able to yield such critical knowledge.</span></p> 
<p class="c13"><span class="c21"></span></p> 
<p class="c27"><span class="c53 c22 c32 c54 c58">End of Turn</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c29 c38"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c38 c29">Results-</span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c29">Economic- </span><span class="c4 c11">It has to be done</span><span class="c2">.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">These words are the only thing that carry Slabal and the Onagi through the task that they have set themselves upon. It is one thing to take a look at a plan and make the decision to tear down ruined architecture. It is quite another to make the decision to bring your hammer down on a piece of architecture that has stood since the time of the Ancestors. Utterly destroyed and unusable it may be, these fragments of architecture are some of the oldest pieces of their history the Crag have remaining.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Slabal, however, is right. A crumbled wall that was once beautiful architecture will not stand to protect those who live behind it. The fact that this ends up being one of the harshest winters in decades only motivates the Onagi further. Collapsed ruins and dirt pits won&#39;t protect the crag from their harsh environment, no matter what they once were. The Onagi do their best to catalog what little remains so that it may one day be remade. None of that makes this any less painful to do.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Or less dangerous, for that matter. The heavy snowfall, icy conditions, and unstable architecture make for constant hazards. Slabal, however, is undeterred. Her diligence and determination to do things the right way cut back on incidents greatly. There are many injuries, of course, but no major incidents.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">In the end, Eschaton is stripped bare. The foundation is all that is left. There is scarcely a single building left that existed before the </span><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">, save for the Esteemed&#39;s pagoda itself. The ruthless treatment of their history tugs at the heartstones of the Onagi. They know it had to happen, but there were some who still clung to the hope that it could be restored.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">The Aspect </span><span class="c4 c11">Stripped Temple Ruins</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;has been removed. The foundation has been laid bare.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Though they still stand resolute, the mood among the Onagi is somber. The need to destroy so much of their own history weighs heavy on them. Further, this destruction happens during a severe cold snap, leaving most Crag huddled in their homes as great architecture is pulled down around them. Though it&#39;s a mild hardship compared to what the Crag have suffered lately, it still makes the Onagi feel like they are not fully attending to their Responsibility. Any Infrastructure check next turn takes a Setback die due to this general low morale.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c29">Political- </span><span class="c2">Several decisions that the Elpahka have made snowball together this winter. It turns out to be a much colder and harsher winter than expected. Since the Samra were given something of a break last turn, food stores are lower than expected. This has several consequences, and the stones themselves tell the Elpahka of them.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">First of all, the First. Thankfully, he plans really damn well. He anticipated more than one thing going wrong at once. His plans easily account for both a harsh winter and a lower than expected food store. Unfortunately, strict rationing will be needed to get through to the spring.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">This rationing is not even remotely as bad as the rationing at the height of the blight, but it brings back bitter memories. No one starves to death over the winter, but the familiar pangs of going to bed hungry return.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">The Aggro and Bakshish particularly resent this. They feel that the Elpahka&#39;s decision to lower the food output of the Samra right before winter during such a precarious time was ill advised. Some are quite bitter, even angry about it. Some understand the need. The Onagi, having directly seen how hard this season was on the Samra, generally understand.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">It&#39;s different for the Samra. Last season, many of their number were weakened, even close to death. Had it not been for the reprieve and chance to regain strength, many Samra would have been too weak to survive the harsh cold no matter how well fed they were. A few hungry nights is a price they gladly pay for the survival of their families. That decision has saved many Samra lives this winter, and they recognize that it was the decision of the wise Elpahka that saved them. And really, without the Samra what do you have?</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">Though it was not used this turn, the </span><span class="c29">Upgrade </span><span class="c2">the renewed Samra can provide does not expire. It represents their willingness to provide a boost of effort to help the Crag thrive, and can be applied to any check they could reasonably support.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c29 c53 c54"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c29">Military-</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Embebi returns with a mixture of triumph and frustration (and, on a more personal level, confusion.)</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">It turns out to be very bad timing for an expedition like this. This winter turns out to be one of the coldest and harshest that the Crag have experienced since the Extermination. Embebi has a great many early successes. She finds a definitive trail left by a large, organized group of Crag that were fleeing higher into the mountains. They appear to have been successful.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Even though heavy snowfall was coming down, Embebi&#39;s enthusiastic determination drove her Stalkers forward to track down their kin. She drove them harder and further than even she expected, tracking the trail high into mountain territory that is deadly even to the Crag.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, in her single minded drive, she over extends. The Stalkers find themselves nearly trapped by heavy snowfall that seals off narrow passes and causes unpredictable avalanches.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Embebi finds a narrow ravine that the trail passes through. It is packed with snow, and clearly impassible. She, with only her second, attempts to find a way through. She is rebuffed, and it is during this attempt that her unexpected encounter occurs.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">When she and her second barely make it back from that, Embebi makes the hard decision to turn back before things get worse. She has avoided any losses so far, and intends to keep it that way. They made progress, they&#39;ll just have to try again after the spring snowmelt.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Embebi, however, does not return empty handed. On the way down, a Stalker finds a Crag body wedged deep in a crevasse. Embebi climbs down to examine it. She finds a young Stalker mummified by the cold and altitude, his broken body half buried in snow. In his pack, she finds a map. This map is a mostly crude representation of these high mountains, but Embebi finds that the Stalker was using it to navigate. He was definitely part of the group that passed through here, and better yet he seems to have had a destination in mind!</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">Embebi is able to roughly determine where this Stalker was going. She isn&#39;t able to narrow it down to a specific territory, but she&#39;s got a few options. These possible locations of the refugees are marked in black on your map. Note that due to the extremely harsh conditions in these high mountains, any checks to explore these territories will receive a </span><span class="c29">difficulty upgrade</span><span class="c2">.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">In addition, Embebi &quot;finds&quot; a perfectly preserved page from the Tome on the Stalker&#39;s body. At least as far as Eschaton at large is concerned. As to who knows the real story of how she got it, well, that is up to her...</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c29">Mental- </span><span class="c4">You are Drivel, and you are </span><span class="c4 c11">completely screwed.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">Oh man, oh Ancestors, oh </span><span class="c4 c11">schist</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;there is </span><span class="c4 c11">nothing.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;There is absolutely zero information in the scraps of incomplete records that you have about any type of </span><span class="c29">Animal</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;inquisitors, or even any kind of order or cult that might produce them. Even worse, judging by what information you </span><span class="c4 c11">do</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;have about their disgusting religion, it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense that they would have anything to&hellip; well&hellip; inquisit.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">In fact, the </span><span class="c29">Animal</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;religion seems to be almost perversely lax. You can find no codes for guiding behavior, no formal guidelines for interaction between bloodlines, no guide to selecting traits or future generations at all. They don&#39;t even seem to have those crude lowlander lists of &quot;sins&quot; and the only thing that&#39;s clearly heresy is plainly and openly rejecting their deity or carrying silver. It seems that nearly any kind of personal behavior was allowed, so long as they paid lip service to their deity. It&#39;s deeply disturbing to you, and frankly you have no idea how a society like that functioned.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">Worse, though not surprising, their religion has little to say about non-</span><span class="c29">Animals.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Indeed, it seems that it is impossible for them to be viewed in a religious light at all, much less as heretics. The </span><span class="c29">Animals </span><span class="c2">considered themselves separate from other races, and considered their perverse beliefs theirs alone. This means that dealing with other races had even less religious guidance, to the point that it was viewed with the gravity of tidying up your home. Nothing forbidden. You shudder as you remember the consequences of this view. You were viewed as debris to be swept away. Nothing more.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">So with no heretics to root out, no moral or ethical coda to enforce, and not even any serious opposing religions to hunt down, just what in the hells would an </span><span class="c29">Animal </span><span class="c4">inquisitor do? It doesn&#39;t make any sense, yet here in front of you is evidence that it did exist. Maybe it wasn&#39;t </span><span class="c29">Animals, </span><span class="c4">but some mad imitators? Maybe this </span><span class="c29">Animal</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was a beast driven insane by the destruction of its culture?</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Those are all theories that the First has already proposed, and you are no closer to proving or disproving any of them. None of the information you have is anything he hasn&#39;t gone over dozens of times. It&#39;s nearing the end of the season and you have accomplished nothing. You are well and truly fucked.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">You begin to resign yourself to a long life of mediocrity. This was your big shot and you blew it. The First will mock you relentlessly for this. You can hear his sneering, nasal, smug voice in your head already.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4 c11">There are two types of people, </span><span class="c4">he chides you as he always does when he knows something you don&#39;t (which is frequently,) </span><span class="c4 c11">One, people that can extrapolate from incomplete data.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">He always stops there. Asshole. As if you don&#39;t know how to&hellip;</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Wait.</span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Waitaminute.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">You&#39;ve been going about this all wrong. You may not be as fucked as you think. You&#39;ve been so focused on how many avenues of information your research has shut down, you forgot to consider that </span><span class="c7 c4">that is actually useful information.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">The First loves lists. You should probably make some lists. You slap everything you have into 2 broad points </span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<ol class="c55 lst-kix_uy5vbcmrdlh3-0 start" start="1"><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;would not have inquisitors to flush out heretics, enforce moral codes, or hunt down enemies of their religion.</span></li><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;did have inquisitors for some reason. You have undeniable evidence in front of you that they did. The scene is undoubtedly their kind of work, save the ritualistic elements. Even if this was the work of a lone mad beast, that beast became an inquisitor </span><span class="c4 c11">somehow.</span></li></ol><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">This means that </span><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;did have inquisitors, but not for the reasons that other religions tend to. Moreover, they appear to not readily disclose the existence of these inquisitors to outsiders &nbsp;or you would have seen some kind of reference to them by now.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">The question you need to ask is &quot;For what purpose did the </span><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;have inquisitors?&quot;</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">As much as it makes your skin crawl, you try to put yourself in the mind of an </span><span class="c29">Animal</span><span class="c2">. What would give them the divine purpose of an inquisitor? What would they need to hunt down and flush out so thoroughly? What would they hate so much that it would give them a divine mandate to destroy? What would be so deeply personal that they would conceal it so well? What would fill them with enough disgust and rage to create such a brutal ritual as the one you see here?</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Wait. Oh.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">Oh Ancestors, </span><span class="c4 c7">you have a hypothesis!</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">The First was unable to find any traces of magic in the ritual chamber other than the runes, but </span><span class="c7 c4">maybe that was the point!</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c7 c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">There&#39;s something else </span><span class="c29">Animals </span><span class="c2">might consider so foul it&#39;s not even on their short list of heresies because they couldn&#39;t even imagine that someone would do it on purpose.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">You examine the ritual chamber again. Not the bodies, but smaller details. In the back, on a small patch of more porous stone, you find a dark stain. A deep splash of Hobgoblin blood shed by the </span><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">. It&#39;s been there for quite some time, but maybe&hellip;</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">You carefully carve out a chunk of the blood soaked stone. With a bowl in front of you, you </span><span class="c4 c11">literally </span><span class="c2">squeeze blood from a stone. Well, more specifically, you will the stone out of the blood, but that&#39;s semantics at this point.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">The blood is a dried powder. You mix it with some carefully selected reagents to reconstitute it. You mix another bowl of reagents, combined with dried wolfsbane and a small amount of precious powdered silver. Holding your breath, you mix the two bowls together and swirl.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">The mixture turns to a foul black tar.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">You whoop triumphantly. You were right!</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4 c11">The hobgoblins in this cave were lycanthropes</span><span class="c2">!</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">Hastily, you compile a First-style list of your points.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<ol class="c55 lst-kix_a97434xrbtjq-0 start" start="1"><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;would not have inquisitors to flush out heretics, enforce moral codes, or hunt down enemies of their religion.</span></li><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;did have inquisitors for some reason. </span></li><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c4">The only thing that </span><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;would likely despise enough to merit an inquisitor is afflicted lycanthropes.</span></li><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c2">The hobgoblins in the cave were lycanthropes. Given there are almost no records of Hobgoblin natural lycanthropes, they were almost certainly afflicted. Further, if they were natural at least a few would probably have died in hybrid or animal form and stayed that way.</span></li><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c2">There was no trace of the affliction on the bodies themselves, but there was in the blood that was shed before the ritual was completed. </span></li></ol><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">Given these points, you extrapolate your two point hypothesis:</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<ol class="c55 lst-kix_1l45bnl9jgvg-0 start" start="1"><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c4">The </span><span class="c29">Animals</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;had some secret sect of inquisitors that was devoted to hunting down and destroying afflicted lycanthropes.</span></li><li class="c16 c49"><span class="c2">This ritual was their handiwork, and the purpose of the runes was to absolutely destroy any evidence or trace of the affliction that might be carried by the bodies.</span></li></ol><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c2">You sit back and review your logic. It extrapolates a lot from shreds of incomplete information, but you feel the hypothesis is sound. You kind of have a headache. You hope the First sees your reasoning. He probably won&#39;t. If he does he&#39;ll probably act like it was his idea.</span></p> 
<p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p> 
<p class="c16"><span class="c4">Oh well. You may still be completely screwed, but hey at least you have something to show for it now.</span></p>
