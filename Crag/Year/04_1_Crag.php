<p>A bold wind courses through the center square of Eschaton, pushing and playing with the robes of those who currently tread its carefully laid (and relaid) stones.  Light suffuses the square, all but for a long stretch of darkness which you now occupy.  Though the sun has risen past the horizon long ago, it is only now that you bear witness to a second sunrise as it finally crawls higher than the… hyperbole, you now gaze upon.</p>

<p>Before you is a massive sculpture of a Crag, shaped in stone, raised to a height equal to that of any three Crag stacked atop eachother.  The figure is stocky, possessing thickset arms, sturdy legs, and in spite of this, delicate fingers.  The face would almost be nondescript, in other circumstances;  Though broad in face and cheekbone, it could be found atop any Crag, of any bloodline.  It gazes, cooly, over the span of the center square, eyes cast upwards toward the Pagoda that still towers over all else in Eschaton.  In accordance with ancient tradition, the sculpture bears no name, no date, no written history to signify it; only a single word graces the plinth upon which it rests; Inspired.</p>

<p>Just reading it once more makes you feel uncomfortable.  It is yet another reminder of who this behemoth display is recognizing; it could be no less clear than if they had just gone ahead and carved in <b>Slabal Nanockova</b> on it, in defiance of tradition, and good taste.  Not that they could have defied the latter much more than they did;  Somehow, now backlit by the rising sun, the light forming a halo of light around the head of the massive memorial, the figure appears possessed of an almost divine serenity that you’re fairly confident you’ve never felt in your entire life.  Needless to say, you are kind of embarrassed.  </p>

<p>You turn to the Crag next to you, a relative youth whose beaming face threatens to outpace that of the sun itself.  You sense he has great pride in this work.  In most circumstances, you would not hesitate to say that such pride is deserved; the attention to stability and reinforcement needed to have such a tall monument stand without fear of toppling or faulting is worthy of recognition.  Indeed, furthermore, the attention to detail in face, garb, and even in shaping texture appearing as hair does all gives honor to the Bloodline of the Onagi.  The fact that you hesitate to praise it in spite of this probably means you’re not really thinking about this logically.  That probably means some kind of emotional response is in play.  You aren’t good at dealing with emotions, least of all your own.</p>

<p>Oh dear.  He noticed you looking at him, and now looks back at you, expectantly.  You wish you knew what the right thing to say in this circumstance is.  You’re pretty sure that ‘Please tear this down’ isn’t it.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Well done, Deedee.  The attention to detail is… commendable.”</p>

<p>Hrm.  That probably wasn’t really enough.  However, he only seems encouraged by your slight praise.</p>

<p id="magenta">“Oh, Layer of the Path, I but wish it could be greater still!  To construct this monument took every iota of my abilities, and yet, if I were to do naught but create such as this over and over, it would take more than a Generation to do justice to what you have driven our Bloodline to accomplish!”</p>

<p>...That, there, is also part of the problem.  It’s that tone, that reverence, of which he speaks of you.  It is unnerving.  It is as though he sees you as more than just a foreelf, a divider of tasks.  He speaks as though you were truly worthy of such immense praise, as though you were fit to be worshipped like one of The Esteemed’s gods.  The very thought of that is almost enough to make you slightly queasy.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s hard to read how much of that may be simple dramatics.  It wouldn’t be unlikely; given recent experiences, it seems dramatics are largely on the rise in Eschaton.  The matter isn’t helped by the fact that Deedee himself seems to be in possession of an endless well of energy.  If you were asked to describe the whole of his being in a word, you would call him ‘Enthusiastic.”  If permitted two words, you’d likely go with “Intensely Enthusiastic”.   Given three, you’d probably question the purpose of the exercise, as two was already more than sufficient and three would simply be an unnecessary extravagance of verbiage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even if it is just dramatics that has elevated this reverence to levels you are capable of detecting, you are concerned that there may be a more widespread reverence that you haven’t detected.  After all, you can confidently state that you are not exceptionally good at reading the feelings and influences of your fellow Onagi.  It is true that you have been receiving isolated incidents of open praise more recently, but you are no stranger to the sort;  One may praise your craftelfship, and that is understandable, for you do always aspire to create objects of the highest standard, so that they may serve the Crag as optimally as possible, as long as possible.  Another may praise your dedication, and that, too, is understandable; it is a good virtue to praise, as diligence in any Onagi should be praised to reinforce a virtue that is key to your Bloodline, and valued by all Crag. But the thought of others holding you in ultimate esteem, to present you as something above and beyond the norm… that is undesirable.  There is nothing you do or create that is beyond the abilities of other Onagi.  You do not want them to think themselves lesser to you, as not only is that an apparent falsehood, but that would discourage them, make them think themselves lessers, that there is something special about you that may not be attainable to other Onagi.  You do not believe any such special ability exists.  You do not believe yourself to be in any way exceptional.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you doubt that structures like this will help the matter.  </p>

<p>You look back down at the inscription.  Inspired.  It seems a deliberate reference to your Bloodname, the legacy of Nanock, the treasured possession of uncountable Crag throughout the Generations.  This, in particular, is cause for concern; it is a rare thing for any depiction of face or form to carry an indication of whom bore it.  It runs counter to the purpose, to think that those who are depicted are not remembered for who they were, but what they were, and what that being means for all living Crag.  Perhaps there, at least, a reasonable, logical objection can be named, even if the motivation is more… emotional than you’d like.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“While appropriate praise is due, however, I fear that I must inquire regarding one element.  This inscription;  “Inspired”.  What was your intention in including it?”</p>

<p>Rather than looking chastised, as you thought he might, instead he seems to become… starry-eyed, is the only term that you can think of.  In a disturbing display, he even begins to smile.</p>

<p id="magenta">“Ah, my Layer, I must attest, that is an extravagance, yet it is one that tugged deeply at my being.  For, indeed, the Inscription bears not just one intention, but several.  Firstly, it speaks true of what the sculpture is; it is <i>Inspired</i>, as all Onagi of these times have been.  Secondly, for this reason, it is to be the name by which the sculpture will be known; it’s <i>title</i>, a concept that is, once again, inspired, this time by word of Lowland practice, one of many that has become known and found fascinating among our Bloodline.  It is said that there, it is a common thing for aesthetic works to bear a Title of their own, often of significance, or multiple significances, as here, to the Art, to better provide context as to the intention of the piece.  Of course, you would be aware of the Practice, Layer; you, more than any of our number, have had personal experience with such.”</p>

<p>His answer gives you pause.  It was not what you were expecting; somehow, it managed to be worse.  You were vaguely aware of this Lowlander practice of “Titling” thanks to your own experiences in those dreadful lands, but you were not aware that such had become more common knowledge; you never spoke to any of the Onagi about it.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“An unusual custom, but true, it is performed in the Lowlands.  How did you come to hear of it?”</p>

<p>Odd.  Now he appears somewhat chastised.  His eyes shift, and he makes a low, nervous noise. Perhaps you had a delayed effect?</p>

<p id="magenta">“...Layer, forgive my hesitance.  I am aware of it, and several other practices, through the words and stories of my Love, an Aggro, who was among those who Went Forth to persecute our Vengeance upon… well, you are aware.  I had hoped that, in indulging in such an unusual practice, it would also serve as a reminder to Future Generations of the times which created such inspiration; for better, or for ill.”</p>

<p>Oh.  </p>

<p id="Slabal">“Deedee, no forgiveness is required.  I did not realize it was of such a personal matter.  I had little desire to make you uncomfortable in that fashion.”  </p>
<p>Just in a different fashion, but it seems you have failed entirely in that regard.  Oh well.  At this point, you may as well stop fighting it.   Besides, he does have a point about Future Generations.  If you force yourself to look at your distaste for the object free from impulse, you are forced to recognize that it stems from your discomfort with recognition.  However, given several more centuries, perhaps a millenia if needed, that recognition will pass; your face, perched up there, will become just one more reminder of The Path the Crag, all their Ancestors, and all their Descendents follow, on the route to Perfection.  So, it’s not really all that embarrassing if the proper scale of things is considered. </p>
<p>In any case, that exchange has left you uncomfortable; perhaps it is for the best to merely move on to your next task.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“While some decisions made for this piece are unusual, I cannot discount that these are unusual times, and it must be expected, and perhaps even acknowledged, that the nature of these times will have influence upon all that is created within them.  Well Crafted, Deedee.  You may return to your duties.”</p>

<p>This time, he manages to contain his smile, but you can still feel his face beaming as he performs the appropriate degree of bow, which you return, in recognition of your relative positions.  And then, without further awkward discussion, you continue on toward your next task.  In fact, you even take the opportunity to focus on your next task.  It’s more comforting than dwelling on what just happened.</p>

<p>Eschaton’s reconstruction fares well; indeed, there are only a few hundred more tasks that you have planned before you will be satisfied with this stage of your redevelopment project.  However, it seems you should have put more of a limiter on the Onagi architects, as it seems that their call and use of raw materials far outstripped Eschaton’s cultivation of such.  While you have no doubt it will recover in time, it concerns you that you would be so short handed at all, given the ubiquity of your construction materials; as such, you made arrangements to speak with one of the Bakshish.  Thankfully, she agreed to meet you within one of the rebuilt gardens, rather than the… squat frustration.</p>

<p>There she is, in fact.  It seems she brought an entire satchel of scrolls with her.  You sincerely hope that most of those will not be required.  You are keenly aware of how… detailed Bakshish explanations can be.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“I thank you for meeting me, Scholar Rasper.  -”</p>
<p>Before you can continue, the Bakshish leaps forth, verbally.  </p>
<p id="saddlebrown">“It is no difficulty at all, Layer of the Path!  Indeed, I would even say that your particular query was of significant interest to me;  In researching it, I became aware of a situation that required resolution post-haste! I can gladly attest that already, plans are being put in motion to resolve it.”</p>

<p id="Slabal"> “I see.  -”</p>

<p id="saddlebrown">“Indeed, the situation is somewhat severe; fortunately, in coming forward to me, you may have given me the impetus to resolve a deeper issue with the matter, rather than merely relying on a placeholder solution that will only function for a century, at best! But, let me start at the beginning-”</p>

<p>Thankfully, unlike some discussions with Bakshish that you’ve had, you are largely able to keep up with this one.   It seem the trouble laid in several of the major quarries surrounding Eschaton, but the cause was not just your most recent project, but, indeed, the whole of the renovation project.  While efforts were made to reuse as much of the ruined stone as possible, the demands of the project were quite intense, which only exacerbated an issue wherein many of the key quarries of certain essential stones had been stripped to a point of structural instability.  While new quarries could be laid, and existing ones deepened, there is concern that doing so might even end up compromising the stability even further.  Indeed, she even says that some of them are so unstable, all that may be possible is to fill them back up with trashstone.</p>

<p id="saddlebrown">“-so, while what we currently have running will suffice, that does lead me to my proposition.  The simplest solution to our issue is to attempt to exploit deposits of essential stones well away from Eschaton, as you yourself did in Eparchy.  However, rather than interfering with Eparchy’s current schedule of production… which is magnificent, by the way, I’ve seen the numbers… I believe I can offer a zone that is all the more <i>tantalizing</i>, and with the support of none other than the Layer of the Path, I have no doubt that any possible objections will be dashed aside!”</p>

<p>Ah, there it is.  You were wondering when it would get to the manic ambition.  ...Although, on second thought, that particular thought was a bit too acerbic.  Perhaps you are not entirely over your previous discusyou just remembered you weren’t going to focus on that.</p>

<p id="saddlebrown">“See, I am privy to some information which may not have yet reached you, even though by all rights it should have.  Due to my Study, I was one of those who travelled with none other than the First Among Scholars when he accompanied the Aggro in their expeditions around the perimeter of Eschaton… and, in that time, he made a fascinating discovery that he insisted on keeping under wraps.  But such information should not be concealed from you!  As the Layer, you need to know all that is available for use in construction, so that you may put it to best use in the name of the Crag!”</p>

<p>Her words of concealment are concerning.  Your personal assessment of The First brooked little in the way of subterfuge; indeed, he seems to you to be an almost inadvisably straightforward individual.  It is one of his qualities that actually excuses many of his other qualities.  Nonetheless, she points, dramatically (see, it is on the rise), toward a distant peak to the north.  At least, you think it’s toward a peak.  It may just be in that direction in general.</p>

<p id="saddlebrown">“High in the mountains to the north, we discovered a substance most unusual; a crystal, of unusual properties, and tremendous hardness, hard and malleable as iron!  The First, he called this substance noqual.  He wished to keep it concealed, to study it, doubtlessly see if the secret held any use for him.  But you have the right to know!”</p>

<p>Oh.  The Noqual crystal.  The First had mentioned that, earlier.  It was on your list for later exploitation. It is somewhat a relief that you can clear up her misconception.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“Ah, I see.  It seems The First did not update you.  It is understandable, as he has been preoccupied.  I am aware of the substance, and its location.”</p>

<p>For some reason, her face falls.  Huh. You would have thought it a relief that her Superior is not involved in clandestine activities.</p>

<p id="saddlebrown"> “He… he told you?  Oh.  Uh.”</p>

<p>There is an awkward silence.  You wish you understood why.  Also, now that you’ve had two awkward pauses in as many conversations, you are eager to move onto your next task.  </p>

<p id="Slabal">“...Regardless of that misunderstanding, I believe the rest of your explanation, and summary suggestion, to be sensible.  If new quarries must be opened to help alleviate this potential dearth, then I will make a priority of it; even if the difficulty may be far away, there seems no good reason to delay, especially as that will give Eschaton’s reserves an opportunity to recover for the next phase of renovation.”</p>

<p id="saddlebrown"> “Ah… yes.  Of course.  Glad… I could be of assistance.  I apologize, if you’ll excuse me, I have another meeting.  It was… pleasant, to meet you, Layer of the Path.” </p>

<p>She doesn’t bow… she is, Bakshish, after all… but instead, gathers her scrolls (thankfully, she didn’t use all of them) and then practically rushes away.  As she retreats, you can see that the back of her neck has become flushed.  You hope your correction wasn’t too distressing.</p>

<p>Still… that discussion does somewhat change your priorities right now.  You should probably return to your workshop, and see what can be temporarily halted to make room for another outpost.  At least, now that Eparchy is largely self-sustaining, you should have more hands available.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as you return, you manage to catch one more glance of the Statue, now illuminated from above by the rising sun.  Once again, you feel uneasy.  You hope you are the only one.</p>
<hr>
<p>The broad expanse of Eschaton churns beneath your clear eyes.  As the sun rises to its peak, you can see all of the features of it thrown into sharp relief… in particular, those which rest upon the newest edifice to be erected in Eschaton.  While, in most cases, such an arrogant display might trouble you, the subject it depicts, looking up at you, is always a source of great comfort to you.  You hope you aren’t the only one. </p>

<p>Ah, but other matters attend.  You can hear the trod of another rising the steps to your pagoda; a curious tread, as you have not heard before.  It bears an unmistakable tell of weight, of heaviness, and yet the pace is executed with care, with unfamiliar delicacy.  All things considered, there could only be one who possesses a tread such as this.  However, as she crests the top of your stairs, you can hear her hesitate, uncertainty clear in her stillness.  You do what you can to make her feel welcome.</p>

<p id="Esteemed"> “Greetings, Stalker Embebi.  Your arrival is most punctual.  Come forth, and be comforted.”</p>

<p>That seems to have done it.  The light, heavy tread approaches behind you.  Guiding Miigra, you tear your gaze from your beloved city towards the young Crag who has come at your call.  </p>

<p id="Embebi">“...Hail, <b>Esteemed Elpahka</b>. I, Embebi, come at your summons.  Decree as you shall, and I will do your ...uh, will.”  </p>
<p>With that, she drops to her knee. </p>

<p>Oh dear.  Tenseness claims her body.  Her face is a knot of poorly concealed anxiety.  You can see a small sheen of sweat upon her brow, and know it has nothing to do with heat or the climb.  Poor youth.  You know all too well what troubles have burdened her heart, and you have little doubt that the manner of her summons has unnerved her.  If it were any other matter, you would have traveled to her, in consideration of her duties… but, for matters such as this, Propriety is in order.</p>

<p id="Esteemed"> “Stalker Embebi, my Decree, my Will, is as I have said.  <i>Be Comforted.</i>  Rise, rest, or remain as you are, all that I now consider is you do so to your preference.“</p>

<p>She pauses, but finally, rises from her knee to stand, tall above you.  It is as you expected.  Few Aggro are keen to be seated.  As you understand, it is a poor position to strike from.</p>

<p id="Esteemed"> “Good.  Stalker Embebi, tell me; how fares your search for able hands?”  </p>

<p id="Embebi">“...>“...Slowly, Esteemed, but with purpose.  As you had counseled, there are some of our wayward kin who make for capable warriors, skilled in landscraft and weapon.  Of now, a full dozen of their number have already strived to complete the Rite of Placement, and now are welcomed as fellow Aggro.  Soon, they will be tested in the ways of the Stalker, trialed to prove their capabilities.  However, as to the rest...  there has been a trouble.”</p>

<p>Ah.  You had a feeling as such.  You had been keeping close attention upon the goings of the Aggro; everything you had heard from your Elpahka concerning the threats to Eschaton, as well as your own insights granted you, have pointed to their Bloodline as being the locus of the time to come.  Hopefully, your timely intervention now is well placed.</p>

<p id="Esteemed"> “It is unfortunate to hear that such a trouble exists.  Speak to me, Embebi.  Tell me your trouble.”</p>

<p>She looks to the side, shame crossing her face.  You begin to worry.</p>

<p id="Embebi">“...>“Elpahka, I wish I could tell you in simple terms what the trouble is… but I fear, it is not so simple.  I almost do not know how to voice it. What I know, however, is that it rests not in your words, or the capabilities of our wayward kin, or in the wisdom of those Elpahka who oversee their Rites.  I fear the trouble rests solely upon myself.</p>

<p>I have spoken to many others of our kin both wayward and our own Aggro, to bring forth those in whom I see skill... but for all that I see of them, speak of them… they do not hear.  They cannot.  They refuse their skills, reject their talents.   They do not speak so, but I see their thoughts upon their faces;  they believe me ill-suited to tell them their own abilities.  They think me naive, or foolish, or desperate for souls.  They are <i>correct</i>.”</p>

<p>...What is this plague that infects Eschaton?  How many times have you heard these words, that those you hold among your best, believe themselves to be your worst?  Is this the truest thing that the Extermination robbed you of?  Not of your Past, not of your Future, but of your faith?</p>

<p>No more.  You will tolerate that no further.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“Embebi.  I will not have you speak of yourself so.  Heed well, for these are the words, not of your Esteemed, not of an Elpahka, but of an old Crag, who has found herself as you find yourself; buried beneath a world of troubles, certain that your burden rests solely upon you, and that you have been found wanting.  The fear you feel, that inadequacy, that crushing remorse; you can only feel it because you <i>are</i> strong enough.  If you were incapable, as weak as you feel, you would have already been crushed; you would not be standing here to question it.  You struggle, because you <i>can</i> bear your burdens alone, and because you can, you feel you <i>must</i>.  But if there is a failure of yours there, Embebi, it is not in your strength… it is in your Trust.”</p>

<p>She stiffens.  You cannot blame her.  You know how hard it is to keep a secret, as she has.  The turmoil of such must eat at her every waking day.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“Young Aggro, Strong Aggro, I know you well.  It is not that you question others ability to help you carry your burden.   You do not question whether there are those who can.  I see all too clearly your Trouble; you question your <i>right</i> to make your burdens belong to others.  Who are you, to share such a great pain, to encumber them with what you can handle alone?”</p>

<p>The tension in her body threatens to tear her asunder.  That is not the only thing that is tearing her apart.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“Speak to me, Embebi.  I have shared a wisdom with you… please, share your wisdom with me.”</p>

<p id="Embebi">“...><i>“They have already suffered so much.”</i>  </p>
<p>She tries to keep her tone even, but she is failing. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“...>“Everything you say, and more, is True, Esteemed.  Even though I stagger beneath them, I am not eager to share these burdens.  I may suffer, but what is new?  They already suffer.  The whole of the <i>Aggro</i> suffer.  We are so few, and each must carry so much; why must they suffer further, for my sake?  I hear what you say, but you do not speak the whole of the story.  It is well to share burdens… but if, as you say, I <i>am</i> strong enough, then it is <i>I</i> who should shoulder <i>others</i>.”</p>

<p>Such <i>passion</i>.  It is a familiar thing.  It is not that she wishes her burdens to lessen.   It is that she wishes herself stronger, to take more.  </p>

<p>This is why you saw her then.  </p>

<p>This is why you see her still.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“... Aggro Embebi, Stalker Actual, Crag True;  The words you say lend nothing but pride to your Bloodline, and all of the Crag.  You are burdened to near your breaking point, and yet still, your aim is to find the strength to take more.  It is admirable.  More than that.  It is what is <i>necessary</i>.   For the Aggro.  For all the Crag.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“...>You are correct that I did not tell the whole of the story.  But neither have you, dear Embebi.  The Aggro suffer.  But it is through you, your actions, that their suffering is lessened, that they work towards healing.  It is not you who demands more of them, who continues to squeeze a stone for more blood.  It is this world, these times, these troubles and more that make it so.  And so, yes, you are right to carry their burdens… so that they may <i>heal</i>.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">Look not to endure your all these burdens forever.  Look to where strength returns to your people.  I will not have you speak a single word of denial that you cannot see that strength returning; even now, you find it in places where no other would see, that no other would even look.  You can see that strength.  Where you see it, you can <i>Trust</i> it.  You can give them back their burdens, so that you can continue to take those from those who can carry on no further.  You will keep your strength when others falter… so that they may once more stand to carry them again.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">This is my wisdom to you.  But I would be a poor Elpahka if I were to give you a wisdom, yet fail to follow it myself.  That is why you are here, in this moment.”</p>

<p>Your eyes glide away from Embebi’s troubled face, to once more gaze upon Eschaton.  Upon all who reside there.  Upon all the Crag.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“I, too, have committed a fallacy.  I, too, have sought to take burdens, so many, a full mountains worth, and yet, never seek to share them back.  It was foolish of me.  Even an Esteemed can be Foolish.  What I must do, what I <i>intend</i> to do, is all that I have told you here today.  I seek those among the Crag who are strong.  I will give them my burdens.  I will give them, and give them, until there is little left to give… until all the Crag have been made stronger for carrying them.”</p>

<p>You look back to Embebi.  Her trouble has eased to concern… and, perhaps, a touch of confusion.  You may be stretching the metaphor a bit far.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“You <i>are</i> Strong, Embebi.  I see it in you.  And now, I will ensure that others will do so as well.”  </p>
<p>You glide your fingers along the tablet, returned to you from where it was lost, returned to you by her very actions.  Finally, they come to rest upon a single name.  </p>

<p>Arcker, The Unbound.</p>

<p id="Esteemed"> “I have spoken with the Named of the Aggro in Wisdom.  I have heard them tell of you, of your Trial, and of your accomplishments.  With them, I have reached an Assessment.  A Decision.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">Your Trial is Ended, Embebi… Arckerova.”</p>

<p>Her eyes narrow.  Her lips tighten.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Esteemed… I… I don-” </p>
<p>Gods help you, you tire of this.</p>

<p id="Esteemed"> “<i>Heed me with Care</i>, young Aggro.  If you speak a single word to me of how you do not deserve this honor, are somehow, in spite of all observation, still wanting, I will have those who attend me hurl you from the cliffside… and you will then prove me right by <i>surviving</i>.”</p>

<p>Of all the things to cause it, finally, it is this frustrated outburst that manages to put a smile on her face.  Curious, but not unwelcome.</p>

<p>“... I am humbled, Esteemed Elpahka.  I will do everything I can to prove you right.”</p>

<p> Now you can smile.   </p>
<p id="Esteemed"> “Excellent.  Now, it is my understanding that typically, such a naming occurs with a great deal of ceremony and ritual among the Aggro.  This is right, and correct.  However, I’m afraid that there is little time… and, such does not seem entirely fitting of a Name of such a Virtue.”</p>

<p>As you expected, this makes her even further relieved.  Now, for the next part…</p>
<p>The next part, it must be done.  Done as you have seen.  You’ve heard the words countless times.  At this point, you do not know if they are your own, or hers, or someone else’s… all you know is that they are crucial.  And so, you treat them with the care they deserve.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“There… is so little time.  Embebi, holder of the Unbound Bloodname of Arcker, when you entered as only Embebi, you beseeched me for my Will.  Now, I give it to you, pure and simple.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">Go, Embebi Arckerova, and <i>Keep Our People Safe… However You Must.</i>”</p>

<p>It seems the words have as much of an impact on her as they have on you.  Strangely, it does feel like a lessening of burdens to have finally delivered them to her.  </p>

<p>Her gaze hardens.  Her eyes burn.  Her hand curls into a fist, and then strikes against her chest, resounding with a deep <i>thud</i> within your pagoda.</p>

<p id="Embebi">“<i><b>Aff. Ack.</i></b>”</p>
<hr>
<p>You are Drivel, and you are having a <i>bad day.</i></p>
<p>Curiously enough, that means that things are going pretty well.</p>

<p>As the summer sun finally gives heat and life to a plethora of experiments, it is only now that you get an opportunity to see the fierce debate between the Head of Herbology, the Head of Arborology, and the Head of Floralogy put into tangible experiment.  So far the results have been… fiercely debated.  And by fiercely, you mean that some of the Onagi architects arranged to have additional insulation installed into the walls of your temporary quarters.  </p>

<p>It seems that the rapid progress being made by the Cliff Rye in the artificial loam v22 batch is both a sign of tremendous success, as it is fruiting at a speed only 20% slower than baseline,  and imminent failure, as that level of growth is clearly unsustainable and will drain the loam of nutrients within the week, just you wait and see.  It’s not an entirely unfounded argument, either; the Protatotype (which now, after weeks of argument,  is tentatively being called a “stonetato” by half of the Heads, and “absolutely <i>not</i> a ‘stonetato’ by the other half) seemed to be flourishing rather well in artificial soil v12 batch, at least until it, well, imploded (‘implotatoed’/’do you have a brain injury’).</p>

<p>Of course, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of that particular test is, there’s a massive backlog of other tests to be done… and, unfortunately, in many cases, you’re the Crag for the job, as the rest of them have already descended into a complicated diagram of vendettas and hurt feelings that largely preclude any of them from getting even close to another’s experiment… and there’s only so much quartzhouse real-estate to go around.  And, unfortunately, that’s on top of all of the day-to-day maintenance that you have to do to keep all of this from ending in blood.</p>

<p>So far, today, you’ve managed to avoid having the Head of Herbology come to blows by reminding her of an unusual variant of Crackplant found growing, naturally, in one of the cracks in the iron-rich cliff face that looms over Eparchy, corrected the notation for the Head of Agrarian Lore by discreetly converting his notes so that they conform with more practical measurements (where he even <i>heard</i> of such a thing as a ‘gram’ is a mystery to you), kept the going-on-four-days meeting regarding Loam Density and its Impact On Stonetatoes meeting from erupting into a riot with the timely delivery of pastries, and preserved a vital sample of experimental Eparchian Quartzwheat from the Head of Gustatory Science’s rear end through a desperate combination of misdirection and slide tackle.</p>

<p>With that done, it’s finally Noon, so you have an opportunity to enjoy your Bread Sandwich.  Mmm.  Imagine the Flavors.  Because there aren’t any.  So you need to imagine some.</p>

<p>As you sit upon a random bench (which, you do have to say, is actually extremely comfortable), staring down a random road in Eparchy, with little more to distract you than the comings and goings of various Samra and Onagi, you find a chance to engage in your second-favorite activity; fretting.</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is, in spite of how busy you are and how tumultuous every day has been, it’s far, <i>far</i> more difficult to ‘ride herd’ (bleck) on the various Heads when they’ve been uprooted and transplanted to Eparchy.  While you actually find it’s rustic nature somewhat charming, for most of them, it’s been a trial just to keep them <i>in the same spot</i>; countless(well, count<i>ed</i>, you’re very thorough) times, you’ve had to curtail one of them from starting an impromptu expedition into nearby, largely uncharted territory just to prove a <i>point</i>.  You suppose it’s not overly different from how things operated in Eschaton; it’s just out here, away from all the trappings of home, there’s very little to fall back on should one of them manage to alienate themselves entirely from the rest.  As such, in spite of several months of work, you once again find yourself with very little tangible results to report on.  This is an issue, as any day now, The First should be coming to check up on said progress, and...</p>

<p>...and… you don’t really know what will happen, then.  So far, nearly every encounter with him has left you <i>utterly baffled</i> as to what he’s actually trying to have you achieve!  You’ve even wondered, from time to time, if this entire project is just some kind of elaborate busywork to keep some of the more irritating Heads out of his unfortunately-cut hair (you know it’s tradition, but it absolutely does not look good on any Crag that hasn’t even started to <i>bald</i> yet).  Frankly, you wouldn’t put it past him; in fact, after spending so many months with them, you can even <i>empathize.</i> </p>

<p>Oh well.  Fretting on it won’t really help matters.  <i>That’s</i> a lesson you’ve <i>absolutely</i> learned over the last year of your life.  As much as it sucks, the best option is just to breathe out, jam the last chunk of your lunch into your mouth, and get back to-</p>

<p>Suddenly, you find yourself jerked from your fret-session by the presence of another Crag next to you.</p>

<p id="olive">“Fair Morning to you, Scholar Drivel.  I see you’ve managed to get away from your Head Herd for a moment.  Would you mind terribly if I were to sit here?”</p>

<p>Before you can say anything, Entrep, who you understand is more or less the ‘head’ of the Onagi here in Eparchy, takes the space next to you… and believe you you, it’s a respectable amount of space she takes. </p>

<p id="Drivel">“...Uh…  Fair Morning, Chief Architect Entrep.  No, no trouble at all.  Indeed, I was just about to continue on, there’s much to do, I’ve got to...”</p>

<p>You search for something to excuse yourself without revealing precisely how pathetic your life is.  You’re pretty sure ‘check the fermentation of goose plop in artificial dirt v2 batch’ isn’t it.  As you trail off, she gives you an appraising look… and then, looks at the remaining hunk of bread in your hand.  A concerned look crosses her face.</p>

<p id="olive">“Are you certain that you must be off?  To be quite curt, Scholar, it looks to me as though you are being run ragged.  I’ll attest, you seem bereft of rest, and have been that way for many a day.  And I doubt subsisting on such slim repast as <i>that</i> is doing you any good.  Is that really all they’ve allotted you?”</p>

<p>You struggle to think of a good excuse… and come up with nothing good.  You guess you’ll have to go with something bad.</p>

<p id="Drivel">“...Oh, this?  No bother, just… all I could grab in time, you see.  Very full schedule, many tasks to see to, many things to experiment on… dabble with… you know, things like that.”</p>

<p>She continues to give you a piercing look.  In spite of the fact that you should probably just get up on that note and continue on, something about that look just seems to freeze you in place.  You can’t even explain it to yourself… it’s like it’s asking a question you… want to answer. But you don’t know what the answer is.  Or even the question.</p>

<p>She reaches into a satchel at her side, and extracts something inside a cloth.  A potent, savory smell wafts from it.  </p>
<p>“Well, it may not be much of my business, but I know full well that if I saw one of my Onagi Craftselves carrying on the way you are, I’d make sure they understand the dangers at hand.  Deprivation of that sort benefits no Crag.  And at the very least, please take something a little more substantial to sustain yourself with.”</p>

<p>She opens the cloth, revealing a delicious looking croquette; based on the smell seeping from it, it must be stuffed with seasoned goose egg.  </p>
<p>Well, damn.  Honestly, you were sticking to just the bread in order to start cutting… but it would probably be rude to refuse an offer like that.  And frankly, you don’t really feel like refusing it, either.  First Hell with it.  The experiments probably won’t catch fire if you rest a little while longer.</p>

<p>Probably.</p>

<p id="Drivel">“...Well, I’d have to have h-head damage to refuse that.  Th-Thank you for your consideration, Chief Architect…”  </p>

<p>As you take the croquette from her hands, she gives you a smile.  Odd.  This is by no means the first time you’ve seen, or even spoken to, Chief Entrep, but for some reason this is the first time you’ve noticed how… symmetrical, her face is.  You can see some of the signs of her age… a lightening of the hair at her temples, the furrows beneath her eyes… but all of it is in proper proportion.  It makes her look… friendly.  You mean, she obviously <i>is</i> friendly, at least by your standards (hasn’t yelled at you yet), but…</p>
<p>You realize that you’re staring.  Looking away, hopefully not too quickly, you take a bite of the croquette.  The rich, savory flavor flowing into your mouth tells you you were spot on.  Seasoned goose egg.  In spite of decorum, a happy hum escapes your throat.  You immediately try to cover it up.</p>
<p id="Drivel"> “mmm<glp>My g-goodness, Chief Architect, this is an excellently made croquette.  D-did you craft this?”</p>

<p>Her smile widens.  </p>
<p id="olive">“Indeed, Scholar.  Indulging in culinary craftselfship is a fine pastime of mine.  As you can likely tell,” </p>
<p>she says, indicating her wholesome self with a sweep of her hand.  You manage to avoid staring this time.  </p>

<p>Not trusting yourself to avoid saying something stupid, you instead settle on making an affirmative gesture.  Unfortunately, this causes you to do something stupid, as some of the egg manages to tumble out of the croquette.  You scramble(groan) to catch the substance before it hits the ground, and amazingly, manage to do so.  Sheepishly, you put the wayward protein back with the rest, to await a future bite.</p>

<p>Chief Architect Entrep manages to avoid mocking your display, instead opting to look out over the busy street.  Rather than looking at any one Crag who walks past, you get the sensation that she’s simply taking in the whole of the scene at once, looking not at Crag, but at Crag.  You try to do the same, but mostly end up looking at the slowly disappearing croquette.</p>

<p id="olive">“What do you think of this view, Scholar?”</p>

<p>Not sure what she’s looking for, you shrug, this time without disturbing the remains of the repast.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“I-it seems very… busy?”</p>

<p>You guess that’s at least somewhat what she was looking for. </p>
<p id="olive">“I think that’s a good way of putting it.  That’s what it was designed to see.  The position of this bench was informed by none other than the Layer of the Path.  I believe that when she chose it, she wanted those who rested here to be able to see all of Eparchy… not the buildings that make it, but the <i>Crag</i> that make it.  The Samra, in their numbers, the Onagi, in their tasks…  I love to come to this place, and face our race.  It gives me such a feeling of… <i>oneness</i>."</p>
<p>Entrep turns to look at you.  At you, not really through you, like most people do.  </p>
<p id="olive">“It seems a shame that, for all the time you’ve been here… I’ve yet seen so little of the Bakshish here.  Or elsewhere.  I know you have your tasks, and experiments… but it seems a poor thing that you attend them to the exclusion of others.  I have yet to even see one within our grand mess… where repast like that can often be found.”</p>

<p>Her voice seems so… vibrant, yet placid, at the same time.   Like a motionless sample dish, that nonetheless is teeming with life.  Yet, in spite of her comforting tones, you can’t help but feel a little sour.</p>

<p id="Drivel">“I… don’t see that going over well.  As I understand, repast is often a social event for many of the Bloodlines, but for Bakshish… well, I suppose it’s more of an Anti-Social event.  I doubt the others would appreciate their meal and relaxation time being interrupted by arguments over seed clusters and fec-fertilizer richness.”</p>

<p id="olive">“Maybe.  Maybe.  Of course, it is difficult to say.  Who can know?  Perhaps it would be uncomfortable and unwelcome.  Or, perhaps spirited debate would be quite a focus of interest for a mealtime spectacle.  It is the keen skill of the Bakshish, after all, and who could not marvel at a capable display of skill, whatever it may be?   Or perhaps, being in the midst of so many other Bloodlines, and not merely your own, would provide a broadening of perspective.  Perhaps, you would even find reason to agree, instead of disagree.”  </p>
<p>She speaks in mocking tones… but, somehow, gently.  Well meant, in spite of the mockery. Unfortunately, for all it’s softness… as much as you’d prefer not to… you have to find fault in it.</p>

<p id="Drivel">“I cannot imagine that occurring.  It’s simply… not how we are.  Bakshish are combative, confrontational… and its because we <i>must</i> be.  It is only through constant contest that truth can be separated from guess, that theory can be proven into law.  Without that constant conflict, that pressure, it is all too easy for our understanding of the world to be compromised by feeling, empathy, or attachment.  “Reality brooks no sentiment’. That’s a Wisdom The First Among Scholars is fond of.”</p>

<p>Her smile deflates somewhat.  You feel bad having caused that.</p>

<p id="olive">“That seems a hard way to spend each day.  To be unable to… connect, with your fellow Crag.  It seems strange, that such a philosophy on life could lead to one such as yourself.  I have seen you far more than your fellows… always tending to one thing, or helping another.  I have not once seen you shout at anyone… more than I can say for your fellows.”</p>

<p>You shrug once more, but you cannot keep some of the sag out of your shoulders.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“...All Crag must endure hardship.  It is how we become more, after all.  But, as for myself… well… some Bakshish are capable of doing great things, making great strides, outthinking, out<i>doing</i> all others, until they’ve managed to wrest ultimate truth from the mysteries of reality by standing atop the achievements of all our kin.   ...And others,”</p>

<p>You say, motioning to your wholesome self… and noticing some egg crumbs you managed to get on your robe, aw dang…</p>

<p id="Drivel">“...well, some must be the ones all others stand atop, content to justify our existence by merely making the success of others possible.”</p>

<p>Oh, second hell.  You must have overdone the patheticness.  There is a sad expression on Entrep’s face… but an impatient one, as well.</p>

<p id="olive">“Scholar Drivel, that sounds to be nothing but scree and debris.  I cannot condone any Crag thinking they must ‘justify’ themselves by ‘merely’ enabling others.  To help your fellow Crag, to aid in their endeavors, to share in their success… it is the cornerstone of who we are.  None of us are an end goal to anything… we are all just Steps along the Path, helping eachother, ourselves, and all who will come after us to achieve something far greater than any of us could.”</p>

<p>Lost as you are in her words, you nearly jump when you feel her put her hand upon your upper arm.  What is she-</p>

<p id="olive">“And besides that, I cannot imagine anyone thinking that a well spoken, dutiful, and considerate Crag such as you would need to resign themselves to such a lowly opinion.  I believe you are capable of much more than you think, Scholar Drivel.”</p>

<p>She squeezes your arm, probably in some attempt at comfort, but as she does so, both you and her pause.</p>
<p>...oh, jeeze.  </p>
<p>Common garb for the Bakshish, like you are wearing, covers the whole body, apart from the head.  There are lots of reasons for this; the most commonly voiced one is that the Bakshish’ frequent exposure to chemicals, reagents, and other experimental substances demands full cover.  However, another unspoken reason is that, among all Crag, the general activities of the Bakshish are somewhat devoid of the regular exertion that most other Crag engage in.  As such, the robes help to obscure such scrawny, or bulging, bodies.</p>
<p>They also help to cover up your particular arms, but you have no doubt that her well-meaning squeeze has discovered your somewhat embarrassing obsession. </p>
<p>...But, in spite of your embarrassment, somehow, the most unnerving part of the whole situation is how her expression morphs from kind admonishment… to surprised intrigue.</p>

<p>For… you aren’t sure how long… the both of you are still- not frozen, but both uncertain of what to say, or what to do.  You just stare at eachother’s faces; you, yourself, struggle to keep your own blank.</p>
<p>You utterly fail to when she gives another experimental squeeze.</p>

<p id="olive">“Drivel, you-”</p>

<p id="blue"><i>“So, you are Scholar Drivel, then?”</i></p>

<p>This time, you actually do jump.  And you aren’t alone.  The two of you swivel your heads towards the massive Aggro warrior who stands behind you, looming over the bench.  You have no idea how long she’s been there.</p>

<p>Another tense moment of silence passes. Finally, you find some words.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“Y-Yes, I am Scholar D-Drivel.”</p>

<p>As you speak, Entrep finally relinquishes your deltoid.  </p>

<p>The warrior grumbles.  As your vision comes into focus, you notice she looks somewhat haggard, and weatherbeaten… definitely more roughshod than the other Aggro you’ve seen around Eparchy.  She speaks, her tone carefully patient, but clearly begrudging.</p>

<p id="blue">“I have been instructed to deliver a message to you.  I was informed it was of great priority.”</p>

<p>She reaches into a pouch at her belt, extracting a small scroll, sealed with adhesive.  Thrusting it into your hand… by grabbing your hand, lifting it, and placing the scroll in it… she then grunts once more, and then walks away to parts undeclared, mission obviously complete.</p>

<p>Somewhat stunned, you examine the scroll.  The adhesive used along its border is of fine alchemical quality.  That leaves you with little doubt as to the origin.</p>

<p>While you’re studying the scroll, Entrep rises from her seat.  </p>
<p id="olive">“Well, Scholar Drivel, I can tell I’ve taken up a bit too much of your time.  But… perhaps we could meet again, some time?“  </p>
<p>Her voice is controlled, placid, as if nothing unusual at all had happened.</p>

<p>You don’t even know how to begin approaching that… so you won’t.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“C-Certainly. Yes.  Of course.”</p>

<p>Not batting an eye at your clumsy redundancy, she heads back down the street.  You watch her go, until she disappears out of sight.</p>

<p>Your gaze turns back to the scroll in your hand.  Well, nothing for it.  You put your thumb near the seal, to tear the <i>oh damn ow shit papercut aargh</i></p>

<p>Sucking on the long cut, you clumsily rip open the scroll with your other hand… admittedly, taking a moment to marvel at the thinness and construction of the paper.</p>

<p><i>Drivel,</i></p>
<p><i>By the time you receive this, I am likely either already returned to Eschaton, or at least, will likely be there by the time YOU can get back from Eparchy.  In either case, I encourage you to collect up your findings from your project there, and bring them back to Eschaton POST HASTE.  I am most eager to hear what you have discovered, and more than that, eager to give you a new assignment, one that is perfectly befitting your knowledge and skillset.</i></p>

<p><i>I know the Heads will probably give you trouble for making them actually write a SUMMARY, but don’t take too long extracting them; if anyone takes too long finishing, just forget it, I doubt any ONE of them will have anything essential in any regard.</i></p>

<p><i>Hurry Up,</i></p>
<p><i>The First Among Scholars</i></p>

<p><i>P.S. If one of the Heads is reading this, likely because Drivel became ‘indisposed’, then whoever you are, you’re ordered to report to Eschaton IMMEDIATELY.  Don’t make me send another Aggro after you.</i></p>

<p>...Aw.</p>
<p>A mocking wind blows through Eparchy.  It promises headaches.  </p>

<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic:</b> <i>The endeavor to recast Eschaton has been a victim of its own success; with on-hand resources dwindling, The Layer deems it too risky to proceed with the penultimate stage of her plans.  After all, what sense is there in rushing something intended to last for Generations?  Instead, she turns her sights towards the borders of Eschaton, seeking to secure further resources for the Crag to use… and this time, likely use for themselves, rather than trading it all away to Lowlanders.</p>
<p>Attempting to use the skill <b>Infrastructure(Establishment)</b> in order to establish Outpost Egersis, located in the northern province containing the aspects High Mountains, Antimagic crater, and Noqual Deposit.  Unlike the design for Eparchy, Ergesis is designed with considerably more spartan conditions;  The nature of the High Mountains and it’s dedication to the simple cause of extraction mean that function must take precedence to form, unlike in Eparchy, where the two were given equal weight.</p>
<p>Due to the shortages which prompted this attempt, this check will receive a Difficulty Upgrade.</p>

<p><b>Political:</b> <i>The Esteemed Elpahka… or, perhaps in this instance, Ledret… has begun a somewhat unusual practice.  As more of The Tome has been recovered by the efforts of both the Aggro and the Bakshish, an accumulation of Names for which no holder survives has been discovered.  While earlier, she was willing to follow the common practice of allowing each of the Bloodlines to devise their own Trials by which to deem their members worthy, it is clear that few truly know what an appropriate Trial is, or even if they should pursue one.  Thus, she has directed the Elpahka to take an active role in this; to go among the people of Eschaton, to see them, hear them, and find those who are the keenest and finest examples of their kind, fit to bear on these ancient legacies.  Even with their assistance, it may take Decades for all the orphaned Names to find a suitable bearer, but no journey can begin without its first step.</p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Recovery(Leadership)</b> Skill to once more mill the Strain of Eschaton in place, representing The Esteemed’s attempts to identify those who are worthy of being counted among Eschaton’s Wisdom, and providing them fitting trials so they may prove to the Elpahka, to the Crag People, and, most importantly to themselves that such worthiness still exists among the Crag.</p>
<p>Due to the faith instilled months ago by the Elpahka’s studious preservation of resources for the common Crag, this attempt to speak to their esteem will receive a Boost die.</p>

<p><b>Military:</b> <i>Embebi Arckerova, Actual of the Stalkers, and now, undisputed Chief of the Aggro… in Echo’s absence, of course.  It is this final consideration that drives her to action; this time, not desperate or grasping, but Determined.  For reasons that are her own, she intends to push her agendas as far as she can before Echo’s return, late in the season.   Pushing herself, and her chosen, to their limit, she once again resumes her patrols of distant ranges surrounding Eschaton.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Reconnaissance(Pathfinders)</b> Skill to search the indicated area.  As this area is mountainous, the Feat The Stone is our Home will apply a Boost die to the check.</p>
<p><i>At the same time, Embebi takes heed of The Esteemed’s words; while many of her best and brightest, like Gustav, were taken by Echo to guide them through the Lowlands, she has far too long neglected that there are others with whom she can entrust her rigorous attempts to muster and train those with the skills of a Stalker.  Perhaps, for those who doubt, hearing of their abilities from the mouth of another may prove the necessary motivation.</i></p>
<p>Driven by a need to prove themselves worthy to their Stalker Actual, and perhaps, in so doing, even prove themselves worthy of an Ancient Legacy, various Stalkers will spend a Fate Point to Invoke the aspect Our Legacy is Set in Stone.  This will allow them to attempt to use the <b>Military Science(Drill)</b> Skill to repeat the attempt to add more Talcsome Stalkers to Division Vigor of Youth.   Thanks to the numbers already mustered by Embebi before her departure, this attempt will receive a Boost die.</p>

<p><b>Mental:</b> <i>In Eparchy, unfortunate Scholar Drivel scrambles to slap together countless(no, counted) numbers of independent studies, dissertations, arguments and, if he must, wild-ass suppositions in order to prove, once more, that he hasn’t just been wasting countless months on serving as an over-titled gopher… even though that’s kinda exactly what he’s been doing.  In spite of the urgency of The First’s letter, he knows that showing up with anything less than a cohesive report would be… frowned upon, and so even if he must work night and day to aggregate the results of the ritual, then so be it.  At least, that’s what he promises himself at the outset...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use <b>Mysticism(Magic)</b> to further development of the Mountain Loam Ritual.  While it is doubtful that the whole of the ritual will be completed in the time given, Drivel’s focus is on providing tangible, visible results… even if they may not be permanent ones, per se.  The First is someone who values what he can see, not what he is promised.</p>
<p>Due to the previous due diligence and record keeping Drivel accumulated, this check will receive a Boost die.</p>


<p><i>End of Turn</i> </p>

<p>Results-</p>
<p><b>Economic</b>- Slabal, shockingly, continues to be Slabal. Construct a settlement, far from home, in treacherous high mountains, with extremely limited supplies, and in an antimagic zone that prevents almost all of the traditional Onagi crafting methods from being used much less simple things like quartz lights?</p>

<p>Yeah, she’s got this.</p>

<p>Congratulations you have (somehow) founded the settlement of Outpost Egersis. It has the following stats-</p>

<p>Name: Outpost Egersis</p>
<p>Size: Outpost</p>
<p>Description: Up to you!</p>
<p>Terrain Aspects:</p>
<p>High Mountains- Egersis is located in difficult to traverse High Mountains.</p>

<p>Antimagic Crater- Egersis was constructed in a large crater that is also an antimagic field. While the crater provides a stable foundation, it is also one of the best and worst parts of the settlement. No magic can be used in Egersis, including magic items, construction spells, spell like abilities, supernatural abilities, or ritual magic.  On the upswing, none of these can target Egersis either - including divination spells.</p>

<p>Noqual Deposit- The crater is scattered with large amounts of the crystal Noqual, which has its own unique antimagic properties.</p>

<p>Settlement Aspects-</p>
<p>Empty Slot</p>

<p>Garrison- One slot empty</p>

<p>The settlement is extremely spartan, owing largely due to the lack of stoneshaping magic in its construction and the material shortages during its construction. On the upswing, Slabal was able to manage resources well. The materials shortage is over, even with a whole settlement constructed.</p>

<p><b>Political</b>- You are Ledret and things aren’t going as you planned, but… that might not be a bad thing. You remember your conversation with Embebi, now of the Unbound Bloodname of Arcker. You remember her determination, her strength, her willingness to bear the weight of the world on her shoulders. You hoped to find a few with her will and her resolve hiding among the more common folk of the Crag.</p>

<p>You don’t find a few.</p>

<p>You find very, very many.</p>

<p>Too many. Each one of them with something that feels genuinely heroic about them. For the Crag to have survived so long, through the Extermination, through the Blight… you suddenly realize the number of acts of heroism, selflessness, and sheer will required to come this far.</p>

<p>So many Crag of great Virtues unsung, so many sacrifices made, so many without whom the Crag just might not have made it this far. To almost an individual, they never brag or boast about their accomplishments. Like Embebi, they see themselves as merely having done what had to be done, and only just barely succeeding at all. They are truly Unsung. The problem isn’t in finding those who seem potentially worth of Naming… it’s that there is so very many.</p>

<p>For all the hardship the Crag endured… you are beginning to believe that a curious side effect may be that only the finest among them have survived this long. An unintentional gift from the Animals, and from the Blight, and from cruel fate itself.</p>

<p>In the end, you find few you are confident in singling out for now… as well as those who are confident in being singled out, but that is only for now. It will take a lot of time to recenter and focus on what is to be done now, with some many of great Virtue to choose from. In fact, like Embebi, the greater challenge may be in convincing them that they are as worthy as you know them to be.</p>

<p>You are, however, certain that whatever comes next, this Generation will be able to withstand it, and perhaps even thrive.</p>

<p>While she did not succeed in her goal of actually Naming a significant number of Crag, she has discovered a great deal of Worth Unsung. This is a Civilization Aspect that can be used in pursuit of Ledret's long term goal of regaining the wisdom of the Ancestors.</p>

<p>If only these Crag will all succeed so well as the freshly named Unbound...</p>

<p><b>Military</b>- Pathfinding- You are <b>Embebi</b> and you're having a hell of a day, let me tell you. You’ve had the Unbound Bloodname of Arcker for like… a week and a half and you’re already concerned you’re fucking it up. Your plan started off great. The Stalkers you have been performing exceptionally. You successfully pathfound your way over to a small black dot on your map. Unsure what you'd find there, you ordered your stalkers to move carefully and quietly to the designated meeting point.</p>

<p>What you found is that Vesnia Andskoti keeps her promises. Her directions led you to a concealed wolf elf base camp. Carefully nestled in a sheltered outcropping, you might not have noticed the dull-colored yurts if you hadn't known what you were looking for. Vesnia met you there, along with her team of riders. They did not let you into the camp proper, but you did gather some info from what you could see.</p>

<p> Other than Vesnia's squad, there are maybe ten to fifteen wolf elves in the camp - aides, guards, and specialists for the most part. Apparently Vesnia's squad has been up here for some time, nestled in this tiny base camp since a few seasons before she encountered you. Even through that nasty winter. Wolf elves don't seem to be as tough as Crag, but they are fucking close.</p>

<p>True to her word, Vesnia shared a limited amount of information with you, including her information about the Stalkers she encountered. Most of the map info she gave you is either territory you've already covered or more boring mountains (though a few more territories can be marked as explored,) but the information she got from the maps carried by the Stalkers is critical. It cut two whole territories off your projected search area. There's still a wide net to cast, but that's some 800 square miles of high mountain peak bullshit you no longer have to cover.</p>

<p>Vesnia then made an offer. You got there well ahead of schedule, only a few weeks into the season. She believes there may be an easier pass into the high mountains located to the east of her camp. She offered to help you find it. Perhaps surprising yourself, you accepted. Still somewhat tense, you set out with Stalkers and Wolfriders together.</p>

<p>At first things were quite tense, but once you decided to talk about nothing but the task at hand things actually worked really well for a while. The wolf riders are able to move faster and carry more gear, but your stalkers are better at climbing and accessing unstable or difficult to reach areas. You were able to cover much more ground than you were expecting. Things were going… surprisingly well.</p>

<p>You are, however, still at the mercy of the mountains, and the mountains are deadly. You had been pretty lucky so far. You hadn't had any fatalities, mostly due to your careful planning, but the mountains bend to no mortal rules. March around up here long enough, and your tile is drawn.</p>

<p>A tile was drawn alright - it just wasn't yours.</p>

<p>Vesnia found the path she was looking for alright. It was narrow but passable, with a sheer drop into a shallow ravine off to the right. Her team moved forwards while yours took a higher vantage point. It wasn’t that bad of a rockslide, all things considered. Mostly loose scree and smaller boulders, not the bigger ones. It hit fast, though. Fast enough to knock Vesnia and her entire team down the ravine.</p>

<p>You took a headcount and got a sitrep from your Stalkers. Everyone made it out of the way in time. You are at full strength, with all equipment intact and even some lowlander style rope and climbing gear borrowed from the wolf elves.</p>

<p>You’re currently trying to gauge the distance down to the bottom of the ravine. Fifty, maybe sixty feet. Plenty of handholds. You could make it down there. You can see survivors moving in the rubble. Pretty sure one of them is Vesnia. She’s badly injured. No way they get out of there without help. Bad weather’s coming, too.</p>

<p>You are getting your things together when your second, an inexperienced but level-headed stalker, stops you briefly. He reminds you that this woman has literally threatened to expose Eschaton to the outside world, to your face. That she admitted she was planning on kidnapping Crag civilians for Ancestors know what purpose. That she killed your fellow Stalkers. These elves are not your allies. They are not your friends.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter, you argue back, if she dies Eschaton is exposed.</p>

<p>No, he answers, if she <i>stops reporting</i> Eschaton is exposed.</p>

<p>He explains what he means. You know where their camp is located. They are few in number and essentially undefended. If you head back to Eschaton right now, grab your Talcsome, and head for the camp you could get to them before they even know something is wrong. The Talcsome aren’t experienced, but they’d have a massive numbers advantage. Hells, the wolf elves probably wouldn’t even think something was wrong if they saw you approaching. You could capture the whole camp, along with its personnel.</p>

<p>It’d be a massive victory. With luck, you’d be able to capture enough material that some clever Bakshish could fake her reports. Even if that’s not possible, well, it’s probably inevitable at this point that Eschaton will be exposed. At least this way, it’d be on your own terms.</p>

<p>You’d capture a precious treasure trove of information about the wolf elves. Likely more than anyone has gotten to date. It’d be a telling blow, a major win for the Crag and a declaration that striking at you will always have a cost. That you won’t be toyed with.</p>

<p>You admit, he has a point. It makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>All you’d have to do is leave Vesnia to die.</p>

<p>So… why are you hesitating?</p>

<p><i>This is not a decision to be made next season. Embebi must make her call right now - help Vesnia, or leave her to die and take the camp. Let me know what she decides, and we will work from there.</i></p>
<p><i>(Note - Vesnia rolled zero advantage and literally maximum threat on her Pathfinding check. The chance of that is 0.6%. I checked. On this turn, of all turns. The dice have a better sense of drama and timing than I do.)</i></p>

<p>-----</p>
<p>So… why <i>are</i> you hesitating?</p>
<p>There are any number of justifications to hesitate.  The forgery plan would involve the Bakshish, and then there’d be no question of whether Eschaton would become aware of a potential threat; it’d be a guarantee.  Bakshish do not understand OpSec.   While you’d have numbers, the Wolves have speed, and even a single one of their number escaping would bring certain conflict.  And while it the battle would be a great victory; the war it would bring would be anything but.  ‘Strategically, you must look to equipment, numbers, and skill; all the signs of capability;  While Body wins the Personal, and Spirit wins the Tactical, it is the Mind which wins the Strategic.  Deprived of resources, reserves, and resolve, no amount of strength will win, no amount of will will continue the fight.’  Your equipment is limited.  Your numbers are low.  Your skill… is talcsome.  And who knows when the Euclast will return… <i>if</i> they will return?</p>

<p>But, the Truth is, even if these were not considerations, you still could not give that order. For the true motivation behind all of them is plain; <i>Guilt</i>.  Not at consigning someone to a terrible fate.  Not at the thought of betraying those you have worked alongside.  The guilt is that once, clouded by rage, you once dared to think that the woman dying down there was an <b>Animal</b>. An unforgivable insult.  An intolerable ignorance, in light of all that you have seen.  You may spend the whole of your days to cleanse your conscience of that slight.</p>

<p>The order is given.  The rescue will commence.  <b>But</b>… guilt will not sway you from taking advantage.  You might feel guilty, but not <b>that</b> guilty.</p>

<p>Vesnia will now have a decision of her own to make.  A bid, made with great stakes.  Rescue is available, for hers and her.  But it will not come for free.  She must pay in <b>reason</b>.</p>
<p>Just as you had told her, so many months ago, that the thing she held was the single greatest threat to her own safety, so too must you now repeat that fact.  It is simple; of all the things that could now cause the Crag to seek Wolf blood, without question, without hesitation, it is the knowledge she holds of Eschaton… and that she has held as leverage.  That leverage is not a shield.  It is a hiltless lith, sharp on all ends.  Its use would only end in Singular Assured Destruction; a conflict in which for each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.  </p>

<p>Rescue is waiting, for all of her threatened kind, but Vesnia must take on another Vow; whatever mechanisms she put in place to expose Eschaton’s location, they must be dismantled in full.  This accident throws that necessity into sharp relief.  What if she <b>had</b> died here?  Not from foul play, but simple caprice of nature?  A great tragedy, a people destroyed, one way or another, and all because of the careless motion of a goose’ wings. </p>

<p>As for why Embebi believes she would keep such a vow… well, once is circumstance, twice is coincidence… but thrice is enemy action.</p>

<p><i>The decision is thus served to Vesnia.  Vow to remove this leverage, a danger to herself and others, and rescue will happen for herself and others.  The search will continue, and the bargain still in place.  Refuse reason, and only foolishness can take place;  A hasty attack, far too late, messy, and destructive.  It will likely fail for their delay.  But it will become the only choice to prevent an even greater tragedy.</i></p>
<p><i>Embebi places the fate of both their people into Vesnia’s injured hands.  Let’s see how she likes it for a change.</i></p>

<p>Vesnia is beginning to see reason. She is beginning to understand what she once thought was a powerful bargaining chip that allowed her to negotiate from a position of strength is instead an absolute guarantee of mutual destruction.</p>

<p>She is also beginning to understand the scale of her misjudgment and mistake. She <i>cannot</i> dismantle the mechanisms she has set in place, not in full. The information she gathered has already been given to her superiors, and her liege. That knowledge cannot be put back in a box. She cannot simply convince him to forget or ignore it. His will, his ambition, his <i>hunger</i> is too strong. Perhaps, you are beginning to see, she is afraid of him.</p>

<p>That leaves Vesnia with only one option, the only thing she can do to possibly prevent you both from coming to pointless and doomed violence.</p>

<p>She Vows to do everything within her power, everything she can, to undo her terrible mistake.</p>

<p>Here is what she can offer: She can give you everything you need to spoof her reports. She will continue to make them in such a manner that keeps her superiors satisfied for as long as possible, which could easily be years. She will also provide you with the information you need that, in the event of her death, you could keep making reports in her name for quite some time, which by the way would include wolf elf code encryption.</p>

<p>She also gives you some crucial information. One, there was some bluffing in the threat to reveal Eschaton. Her liege largely wants Eschaton’s secrets to himself. In the event of a war, they would likely keep the location secret for as long as possible and only reveal it if it was the only way for them to win. This means one or two missed reports from her actually <i>wouldn’t</i> doom Eschaton. She would have to miss her reports for two seasons in a row, and even then they would likely sent a team to find out what happened  before taking any violent action, much less declare Eschaton’s existence to the world.</p>

<p>What she has given you so far is all she can do. Her soldiers are loyal to her, but they give her cold stares. What she has offered borders on treason, but she understands that it is the only way to prevent a conflict between them that doesn’t need to happen. She has broad authority to interpret her objectives, and her main objective is to learn from the Crag. She intends to achieve that objective. She hopes that you are right, that learning the wisdom of the Crag’s more stable Path will influence their own leaders with time.</p>

<p>She hopes that what she has given you is enough, because it is all she has left to bid. </p>

<p><i>It is enough.</i>  In words spoken openly, it is barely enough. In the words held within, more than enough.  Because it reveals a dreadful mirror, and one that not even a Crag as uncomplicated as Embebi can ignore.  In spite of reason being the excuse, the truth is shared; it is guilt, guilt from misunderstanding, that compels both.  And worse, there is the deeper reflection;  she knows she must keep truths hidden, for the betterment of all people, and regrets what truths she has already loosed.</p>

<p>You are Embebi Arckerova.  She is Vesnia Andskoti (odd end to nymic but whatever).</p>
<p>You are Vesnia Andskoti.  She is Embebi Arckerova.  </p>

<p>Together, you save yourself from yourselves.  You protect your people from themselves.   And yet, for both of you, a grand obstacle interferes.  A leader, a master, a liege, a sib.  Those who would see the end of all your people in the name of your people’s prosperity.</p>

<p>What is to be done?</p>

<p><i>Something.</i></p>

<p>That truth alone shakes the mountainsides.</p>

<p><i>Vesnia is rescued. A path is chosen.</p>

<p><i>Thanks to Embebi's decisive actions, most of Vesnia's team is saved. They will be out of action next season while they recover, but will be able to continue this little project of yours.</i></p>

<p><i>Of special note, there was a more concrete outcome to rescuing Vesnia. You also recovered her maps and pathfinding results.</i></p>

<p><i>As it turns out, her hunch about the pass is right. The territory that all this nonsense happened in has the Aspect High Pass.</i></p>

<p><i>Apparently this rockslide was a fluke. The pass is a generally stable way to reach the peaks, and is a much easier and safer climb.</i></p>

<p><i>As long as you have access to the High Pass, all checks to Pathfind the dangerous peaks will receive a boost die. This Aspect may also be invoked to assist in such endeavors.</i></p>

<p><b>Recruitment</b>- Okay, so what happens here will likely swing on what Embebi decided to do above. With zero successes and  zero advantage, though, pretty clear recruitment wasn’t successful for some reason. If that’s because Embebi was busy taking a settlement, or busy doing something else (probably highly inadvisable,) well, we will have to find out.</p>

<p><i>An important note: While you did not succeed, you also got no Threat. The recruits from last season are still around. You will still have the boost die next attempt.</i></p>

<p><b>Mental</b>- You are Drivel and things are… kind of working out for once? </p>
<p>As First used to (hah, used to) chide you, “There are two types of people. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete information…”</p>

<p>Shockingly, as it turns out, you’re… really fucking good at that. Huh.</p>

<p>Like the issue with the ritual chamber, you find yourself with a pile of completely unrelated spirals of information from numerous people way smarter than you, none of which complement each other and none of which make any sense when combined to the point of being completely contradictory. Once again, you remind yourself that closing off a ton of possible pathways is useful information.</p>

<p>You combine what you definitely know from your record keeping with what you probably know from the various random tangents of research the Bakshish have been firing off on. You combine what information you can. You find apparent contradictions that are based on solid information and see what happens if you treat them as if they were both true. You throw in your own wild-ass suppositions to fill in the gaps. You make like… a lot of lists.</p>

<p>You are expecting to have at best, some proof of concepts and solid leads for further research.</p>

<p>You end up with a functional plan for a ritual.</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>

<p>You double check your work. You can find no mistakes. There’s nothing that discredits it. You actually have a functional outline of a ritual, that could in fact be performed as-is. </p>

<p>You genuinely aren’t sure how that happened.</p>

<p><i>Congratulations! You have (somehow) created the ritual Mountain Loam!</i></p>
<p>Risk- Medium</p>
<p>Range- 1 square from a settlement</p>
<p>Target- 1 Territory or Settlement with a Mountain related Aspect</p>
<p>Difficulty- 2</p>
<p>Effect- This ritual will add a Mountain Loam Aspect to any mountain settlement or terrain. This Loam is useless to start with, but is fertile and can be used to grow a wide variety of crops. The Loam you developed isn’t quite as fertile as the Loam developed by the Ancestors, but it’s practical enough - at least as fertile as average Lowland soil.</p>

<p>Note that this is medium risk magic - excess Threat could damage settlements or terrain, though irreparable damage is unlikely. </p>

<p>Now we just gotta see what First thinks of this...</p>
