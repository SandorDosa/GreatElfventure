<p>  </p> 

<p>A wind… likely of some description… blows across the mountainside.  You assume.  You aren’t really paying attention to the wind right now.  The whole of your attention is focused on the lump of cordwood in your hands.  </p>
<p>The surface is cracked.  Barked long ago, dried quickly, much of the durability and flexibility of the timber has been compromised.  Not that it would have had a great deal to begin with; the grain is warped, its surface dotted with knots.  All in all, to extract any suitable material from the length, you would likely need to lathe away into the heartwood, assuming that it is not also warped by long neglect. And yet…</p>
<p>There is some potential here.  Not as construction material, no.  As utilities, however… tool handles, splitters, spreaders, ladders, scaffolds… they may suffice, in the short term.  Honestly, a part of you is hesitant to use this timber for even that use; it is doubtful that even with careful treatment, the parts constructed would last more than a handful of years.  However, that hesitant part of you is, by and large, being shouted down by the part of you that <i>somewhat emphatically</i> insists that advancing is better than idling, even with substandard materials.</p>
<p>You are <b>Slabal</b>, and you are momentarily concerned by the force with which that emphatic part of you just made itself known.  It is disconcerting to you to consider that there may be a part of yourself over which you do not have absolute control.  However, since the insistence of that part is toward further labors in the service of Eschaton and the Crag people, your concern is only, as mentioned, momementary.</p>

<p>Analysis complete, you lower the lump of firewood, turning to the Crag next to you.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“The material substandard, but I can see uses for it which would preserve stronger woods for other tasks.  You said there was a great deal of this material left?  I find that surprising, considering your earlier reported shortage of timber.”</p>
<p id="brightpink">“Indeed, Layer.  At first, I believed it to be an error in our records, but it appears that our need for firewood this winter, even considering its ferocity, was significantly reduced… Which, I believe, stands as proof of your considerable talents in structural design.  The Ambon Aeternal alone saw total usage drop by as much as 30% compared to previous winters; I can only imagine the total savings extrapolated across all of Eschaton.</p>
<p>I will admit, I had somewhat anticipated improvements… many of those structures were drafty enough to be mistaken as Heads of Studies… but I underestimated the scale of the improvement, to my chagrin.  Had I known, I may have instructed the Samra to reserve less of the harvested timbers for use as firewood. My apologies, Layer of the Path.”</p>
<p>Ah.  You hadn’t considered that.  It’s somewhat of a shame; had you been more aware of that detail, you might not have had such an idle winter.  However…</p>
<p id="Slabal">“There is no cause for Apology, Scholar Walter.  Even recognizing said improvements, it would have been imprudent to chance our supply of necessary firewood.  It is an undesirable waste, but one that is preferable to a want for sufficient heat during a trying winter.  For now, all that remains is to see what use these remnants can be put to.”</p>
<p>Your attention is still upon the largely ruined wood before you, so it is not until the scholar speaks again that you become aware of the doubt resting on her face.  </p>
<p id="brightpink">“Layer of the Path… are you certain that this action is… fully considered?  I do not claim to have your mastery in the architectural arts, but timbers such as this are, to my understanding, generally undesirable.  Would it not be better to simply wait for the next harvest, and use freshly, properly prepared timbers?  It is not as though these remnants would go without use; properly stored, they should easily last until next winter, where they can once more see their intended use.  Why, with this surplus, we could even factor a greater quantity of the next harvest towards structural purposes.”</p>
<p>Her question does give you pause… after all, it’s almost a perfect echo of that hesitant part of yourself.  After all, it <i>is</i> a completely rational, reasonable suggestion.  Attempting to makeshift equipment with this sub-standard material is somewhat needless haste, considering not only the coming harvest, but also the promised timbers from the Rivers.</p>
<p><i>However.</i></p>
<p id="Slabal">“Your concerns are reasonable, Scholar.  However, there are a great many projects that were unduly delayed by our previous lack of resources, as well as the damaging winter, and I’m afraid that if I am to keep some semblance of a Timetable on many much-needed improvements, some… unorthodox measures must be taken.  Is it necessary that I elaborate on the necessity of said Timetables?”</p>
<p>Scholar Walter’s expression becomes blank. </p>
<p id="brightpink">“Of course not, Layer of the Path.  Your wisdom in this area should not come into question.  I hope you will once more forgive my impertinence.”</p>
<p>Hm.  You’re not certain why she seems so conciliatory now, but it does come as some relief; having to explain your timetable to one outside of your Bloodline may have been difficult… especially if you seek to avoid showing how much of your current haste is driven by a mounting need, rather than practical concerns.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Again, no forgiveness is required, Scholar.  However, I would request that you make a full accounting of the available timbers… regardless of their nature… available to me at first opportunity.  There is much to be done, and the sooner work begins, the more advantageous.”</p>
<p>She gestures the affirmative, and then walks away without another word.  You get the feeling that there is something unusual to her actions… they are perhaps a little too fast?  You can’t really parse it.  Oh well.  There are other matters to concern you.</p>
<p>You turn your attention once more to the lumber in your hand.  Turning it over, looking at every corner of it, you can see a useful purpose contained within it;  although the surface is largely useless, if you carve away the imperfections, within you can see… dowels.  Definitely dowels.  The rungs of a ladder.  Without any further thought, your hand moves to your carving lith, while your feet begin an automatic trod toward your workshop.  As you walk, useless flakes of wood are left upon the streets of Eschaton, or carried off by the wind you suppose exists.</p>
<p>In spite of all the pent up restlessness that has plagued you the last few months, a deep sense of ease settles over you as you begin this simple task.  To work, to create, to build; to take the raw and through it, make manifest the will of the Crag people.  This purpose is carried in your blood, along the lifeforce flowing through your veins.  Your mind, body, and soul work in tandem, all towards a single purpose, one that has been too long delayed.</p>

<p>Eschaton must be <i>completed.</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>-In conclusion, the simplest explanation for the lack of any kind of applicable results from my research must be attributed to the dearth of usable knowledge available for use in informing practical explorations of the limits of Divine Favor.  Quite simply, while I will state that the presearch presented by <s>Scholar Dri</s>  Scholar Savant Drivel was by all means complete, it was also complete-ly out of date, mired with supposition, and undermined by a fundamental lack of any kind of foundational understanding.  None of this is the ‘fault’ of anyone, per-se, considering the resources available, and what knowledge has surely been lost, but the apparent lack of any attempt to rectify-</i></p>

<p>The pen stops in your hands.  You stare at the passage that was flowing from your prodigious mind just a moment ago, and something about it seems… for lack of a better word, <i>unfair</i>.  That’s not what stopped your hand, however.  That was because you realized that you were feeling that way, and for the life of you, you’re uncertain as to <i>why.</i> </p>
<p>After all, such aside admonishments are completely normal; regardless of how impossible it is to actually <i>expect</i> that the study of Lowland Esoterica would have been making an attempt to keep up with the progress of Lowland culture and religion, pointing out that they have failed in their particular field helps to serve as a not-too-subtle reminder of where authority rests.  It rests with you, <b>The First Among Scholars</b>, of course.  However…</p>

<p>However, the problem is that, while the one you <i>want</i> to admonish is the Head of Lowland Esoterica, who hasn’t done a day of actual <i>work</i> in nearly a century, the practical fact is that probably the blame would come to rest solely upon Drivel… and, for some reason, that fact troubles you.</p>

<p>Slowly, you put the pen down.  Rubbing your eyes, you glance at the candle by your podium; by its taper, you can tell that it’s likely a few hours past midnight.  Maybe that’s the problem.  You always did get a bit too sentimental when tiredness overtakes you.  Your eyes drift over to your remaining doses of concoction.</p>

<p>...Maybe not tonight.  There’s only a few minutes left in your closing words, at best, and then you’d be left with another hour or more of wakefulness, and, sadly, no real idea of what to <i>do</i> with that hour.  That, more than anything, is the true tragedy of this situation; you’re <i>stumped</i>.  In spite of numerous late nights of examination, experimentation, and evaluation, you’re really no closer to understanding many of the elements of the Miracles you witnessed in the lowlands than you were when you started.  For every hard won answer, a dozen more questions appear… the answers to which then seem to contradict the answer that spawned them.</p>

<p><i>Faith</i>.  That curious term, apparently central to all of this, and yet so damnably elusive.  You know what faith means to you; blind acceptance.   After all, that’s what a lifetime of training taught you; those primitive societies that depend on faith do so because they are too wretched and ignorant to look for the root causes of nature, and so they simply accept what they are told by authority.  Faith is, more than anything, a valuable tool wielded by those who wish to control the masses through ignorance.</p>

<p>...At least, that was what you believed to begin with.  Now… you are less than certain that that definition is <i>absolutely</i> true.  As happens so often, it appears that beneath what was a known and accepted rule… or, in this case, definition… thorough investigation reveals numerous cracks and corner cases.  First and foremost of these cracks is what you yourself witnessed; the miracles that were performed in the Lowlands nearly a year ago.  Those were <i>real</i>.  No matter what, you must never allow yourself to question that.  They were <i>real</i>, they <i>happened</i>, and you were there to <i>witness</i> them.  Discounting what you saw with your own two eyes in order to try to make <i>reality</i> fit a <i>flawed theory</i> is <i><b>madness…</b></i> and, also, bad academics.  </p>

<p>You slump into your comfortable chair, taking a moment to wriggle in deeper.  The deadly chill of winter has passed, but there is still a tinge of it within the spring air.  Once snug, you can feel weariness set more heavily upon you.  Off to your left, another concoction sits prepared, but you waive that as well; that substance is for relaxation, and frankly, in spite of all the difficulties you’ve had, you aren’t really <i>stressed</i>.  A curious dichotomy, that; typically, when the truth of a matter eludes you, it is frustrating in the extreme, but for this subject… well, much of it deliberately <i>advertises</i> that it must be unknown and unknowable.  It’s hardly surprising that one elf with incomplete information hasn’t cracked that problem in three months, even if that elf is possessed of a peerless intellect.  However, what <i>is</i> frustrating is that, with your available resources now exhausted, there’s no clear way forwar-</p>

<p>Sudden realization beams into you, before weariness claims you utterly.  <i>Nearly a year.  Winter passed.</i> </p>
<p>That’s right.  The Potluck.  That’s where your answers reside; in the same place the questions originated. </p>
<p>A small, satisfied smile momentarily crawls on your face.  That’s settled then.  You’ll arrange travel tom-</p>

<p>------</p>
<p>Don’t grind your teeth.  Don’t.  Do not.  It will not help the matter.  It will only make your frustration evident.  That’s probably what he wants.</p>
<p id="First">“Let me get this straight… you want me to traipse across the breadth of the Lowlands… further West than any Crag has ever traveled, and the only reason it isn’t further South is because of that <i>insane</i> detour you forced… into unknown, canyon riddled terrain, filled with Ancestors-don’t-even-know manner of beast, brigand, and badland… without an <i>escort?</i>”</p>

<p>A deep grumble emanates from the cliff of Cragflesh in front of you.  You suppress your urge to flinch; you’re in broad daylight, witnessed by dozens of other Crag.  He can’t kill you.  He <i>might</i> hurt you, but that probably would only help your bargaining position.  It takes every iota of willpower you have to continue looking at your potentially impending throttling in such logical terms.</p>

<p id="Echo">“...I see you have misunderstood me, First.  I will attempt to be more clear, for your sake.  What I want from you… is <i>Nothing</i>.  No. Thing.  I ask nothing of you, desire nothing from you.  If you wish to risk yourself once more on this foolish endeavor, you may, but it will <i>not</i> be with any Stalkers, nor any other of my Aggro.  They are engaged in far more essential tasks.”</p>

<p>You bristle, in spite of yourself.  More than just his words, it is the impatience in his massive voice that sets your blood rushing.  He isn’t taking you seriously.  </p>

<p id="First">“<i>More essential tasks?</i> Like what, lifting heavy things, then putting them back down?  The annual Lowlander Potluck is of <i>crucial</i> importance!  It’s how we can keep abreast of what is happening down there, what we need to prepare for, and any number of other vital developments!  Without it, we will be going into this next year practically blind of what is happening down there!  What could you possibly be doing that is more important than that?!”</p>

<p>He frowns.  You don’t pay attention to his face, though.  You’re watching his hands.  Currently, they’re tucked under his crossed arms, but you know all too well how quickly he can move when driven to.</p>

<p id="Echo">“Preparing.”</p>

<p id="First">“<i>Preparing?!</i>  That’s all you have to say for yourself?!”</p>

<p>He says nothing.  You end up grinding your teeth.  Dammit.</p>

<p id="First">“<i>Look</i>, Echo, I know you don’t have the desire, or likely the <i>capacity</i>, to understand the importance of what happened as recently as <i>last year</i>, but that fiasco you yourself witnessed was just one example of <i>why</i> it is crucial that someone be there in attendance!  Without the knowledge of what had happened there, there is so much we would have missed out on, possibly to never learn, likely until it was too late!  I know that you probably only see trips into the Lowlands as a keen opportunity to go step on a bunch of Lowlander necks, but the rest of us actually have the ability to <i>learn</i> from-”</p>

<p><i>WAIT, SHIT</i> you can see his hands clenching</p>
<p>You look up to his face, seeing that his teeth are bared, his brow at full furrow.  </p>
<p>You find your words caught in your throat. </p>
<p>One of his hands unfurls from beneath his arm…</p>
<p>…and then reaches up, grabbing his temples, as an explosive sigh bursts from his mouth.</p>

<p>There’s a moment of silence as you process this.  You’ve never seen… nor ever thought, or even imagined you <i>could</i> see… Echo getting not mad, not enraged, but… frustrated.  The familiarity of that gesture to your own common expression boggles you.</p>


<p id="Echo" class="whisper">“...seven, eight, nine… Urg."</p>
<p>His hand drops, and he stares at you once more, expression fallen.</p>
<p id="Echo">"First Among Scholars.  I have no doubt that you believe your needs essential.  You may even be correct.  But on this matter, I will not budge.  At this time, every Aggro is needed to serve in Eschaton’s defense.  There are matters at hand which you are unaware of.  Having told you this, I would hope that, for once, you would respect that this decision is <i>My</i> Responsibility, as Chief of the Aggro, not yours.”</p>

<p>...Well, shit.  You’re legitimately at a loss for words.  He pulled the Responsibility tile.  And, dammit, he’s correct.  It <i>is</i> his call to make, even if he’s making the wrong one.  Only one final recourse comes to mind.  It’s risky, but you’re desperate.  You raise your hands in a supplicating gesture</p>

<p id="First">“Okay! Okay.  Fine.  I get it.  But… Look, could I just talk to Stalker Embebi about this?  She should understand-”</p>

<p><i>His hand is moving again</i> but it just stops with a massive finger, pointing at you.</p>

<p id="Echo"> “<i>Stalker Actual Embebi Arckerova</i> is this very <i>second</i> risking life and limb to search for threats to Eschaton’s safety, <i>First.</i>”  </p>
<p> The massive finger swings away from you, pointing towards a distant mountain peak.   </p>
<p id="Echo"> “She and her skilled, loyal Stalkers are plunging deep into unexplored territories, to root out any possible foe that could stand to endanger the security, and the <i>secrecy</i>, of our home.  She <i>understands</i>, more than any other, where the Priorities of the Aggro are.  So I hope that, even if you cannot find room in your irritating soul to foster respect for <i>my</i> decisions, that you can find room to respect <i>hers.</i>”</p>

<p>...oh.  </p>
<p>Wait, is that it?  Is that all you have up here?  ‘Oh?’</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Looks like it.  Because, damn.  That is a finely crafted shut down of any argument you could have possibly had at this point.  You aren’t the only Crag around to notice, either.  While the small crowd around you might have saved you from being strangled, it certainly didn’t stop you from getting burned.  </p>

<p>Welp.  Okay.  Damage control mode.  You’ll figure out your next step later, for now you just need to disengage with some measure of your dignity intact.</p>

<p id="First">“That is… a compelling argument, Echo of Blood.  Even though it works against me, I must note it is gratifying to have such come from your words, and not your hands.  I, for one, welcome such an improvement.”</p>

<p>Walking a lith’s edge here… his furrowed brow means he might be getting it… time for the getaway!</p>

<p id="First">“Very well.  I understand.  The Aggro cannot assist me.  I will discount your assistance as an option.  I wish you a eventless day, Echo of Blood.”</p>

<p>Aaand back it up, little more, turn around and go <i>go go</i> not too fast but whoo boy <i>not too slow.</i></p>


<p>As you reach the Center Square of Eschaton, you finally give yourself a moment to stop and collect your thoughts.  After all, you haven’t heard any thudding footsteps coming swiftly from behind, so it seems like you managed to get the last word in on Echo… not that that’s overly comforting, considering how fucked you are.  </p>

<p>You’re dimly aware of the location of the next potluck, and it is by no means a simple trip.  The home of the Winged, Asavardi, was over <i>thrice</i> the distance you had traveled on foot to the home of the Fires; while you have no doubt that you could handle the rigors of travel… you proved that well enough on your <i>last</i> outing… you know full well that without Embebi’s guidance, you would have become well and truly lost even over that relatively short distance.  You <i>might</i> be able to procure an accurate enough map and follow it… but there are all too many ways that could end <i>horribly</i>.  And you’d have to make the trip alone… there’s no way any other Bakshish, not even <i>Drivel</i>, would be stupid enough to follow you on a suicide mission of that caliber.  </p>

<p>Your hand reaches up to massage your temples, but you stop mid-motion… for some reason, the action seems less… comforting, now.  Well, since you’re in the Center, there is one thing you know you can take some measure of comfort in.  Round the corner, and…</p>

<p>There it is. Looming, well illuminated in the morning sun.  The likeness to The Layer presented in this magnificent piece is truly remarkable.  It feels like she’s looking at you, her calm, collected eyes assuring you that there is nothing to panic about, that panic is illogical and unproductive.  </p>

<p>What would she do in this predicament, you wonder?  </p>
<p>The answer seems to pop into your head, all of its own volition:</p>
<p><i>Oh well.  One cannot control all aspects of reality.  One must simply work with what is available.  Accept the situation, and move on to the next task.</i>  </p>

<p>...Okay, yes, that’s wise, but honestly, it’s not particularly <i>helpful</i> in this situation.  You’re pretty sure that you can’t just let this one go.  Frankly, it feels too much like all the times that you’ve been Right, and provably so, about some situation or course of action, and then once again ignored by people who thought they knew better.  In fact, it’s <i>exactly</i> like all the times you had to deal with The Esteemed.  From this same place, your eyes can trail over to the Pagoda, hanging above the Center.  </p>

<p>...Maybe you could talk to her?  She might be able to convince… <i>ech</i>.  You discard that thought before it even finishes forming.  As distasteful as it was to try and convince Echo, spurring <i>her</i> to action would likely expend what little remains of your patience… and sanity.  You can even imagine how it would go:</p>

<p><i>Your youth is making you too brash, First! You must learn to be patient because what could possibly be the point of trying to resolve disasters before they happen! Let’s all just hope that the gods will guide us to a good end and completely ignore the fact that we probably could have resolved this sooner nyeh nyeh nyeh!  Just have faith nyeh nyeh nyeh!</i></p>

<p>...Hrm.  Actually, now that you think about it, you can’t specifically recall The Esteemed telling you to Have Faith.  You’re still not entirely sure where you first heard that.</p>

<p>...Have Faith.  Hm.</p>

<p>Okay, sure.  Why not.  It’s not like you’ve got any better plan, right now.  Call it experiment # 27.</p>
<p>You look to the sky,  the great shimmering blue, spotless.  You place your hands together, as you saw in the diagrams, close your eyes, and give prayer another shot.</p>

<p><i>Oh Caelestros, who is supposedly the patron and creator of all elves, I beseech thee; get me out of this jam.  I find myself ensnared in a awful fucking predicament, once again dismissed by those who must think that such things as</i> knowledge <i>and</i> forewarning <i>must be passing fads, and so once more I remain the lone sane elf, predicting a disaster that everyone’s going to ignore until it inevitably happens and then ask ‘oh, who could have seen this coming?!’, like it hasn’t happened</i> half a dozen times <i>already.  If you truly give two wet plops about some of your people, figure out some way to get me to the Potluck so whatever shocking realization happens there</i> this <i>time doesn’t go entirely unnoticed by the Crag people.</i></p>
<p><i>Good luck with that one,</i></p>
<p><i>-Renyan</i></p>

<p>You wait a moment, eyes still closed.</p>
<p>...You aren’t feeling any teleportation.  Or any detailed geographical knowledge flooding into your mind.  Or, like, wings growing from your back, or anything.</p>
<p>Well, don’t discount it entirely, yet.  Maybe you teleported without feeling anything.  You open your eyes… and just see the same sky again.  Yep.  And the same pagoda again.  Yep.  And the same pair of Crag flanking you aga- wait a moment.</p>

<p>You involuntarily flinch as you realize that two other Crag, in long robes, are currently standing <i>uncomfortably close</i> on either side of you.  That, in and of itself, might not have made you flinch… the real deciding factor, however, is that both of them are wearing the garb of the Mountain Mothers… who usually you only see when there’s a body to dispose of.  Having not seen a body prior, your mind screams that obviously that means that <i>you</i> are about to be that body.</p>

<p>You flinch.  You stagger.  You may have even yelped.  And, probably, you would have pitched backwards had not both of the taken hold of you to arrest your stumble.</p>

<p id="white">“My apologies, First Among Scholars.  We did not wish to alarm you.”</p>

<p id="grey">“No, not at all.  We simply did not wish to interrupt you.  You seemed deep in thought.”</p>

<p>This exchange, as well as the multitude of witnesses, reassures you that no, these are not assassins either (you really have been on an assassin trip recently), and so you stand up straight, clearing your throat.   </p>

<p id="First">“Ah, yes, indeed.  Deep in thought.  Pondering and considering all manner of topics, you know how it is.”</p>

<p>They nod in unison.  Both of them are wearing long, grey cloaks, the hoods wrapped tight around their throats.  Both of them sport the same hair styling… same hair color… same eye color… same… general… facial features…</p>
<p>Well.  Okay, that’s right back to disconcerting.</p>

<p>Time passes in silence.  They’re both staring at you.  You’re not sure what they’re waiting for.</p>

<p id="First">“Uhm… Can I be of assistance?”</p>

<p id="white">“Thank you for offering, First Among Scholars.  Yes, indeed, we do have need of your assistance.”</p>

<p id="grey">“We have come to understand that you have become the most knowledgeable minds in all of Eschaton as regards the Otherelves of the Lowlands.”</p>

<p id="white">“Indeed, from all we have heard, you seem to have great insight and knowledge into them. Would you agree with that, First Among Scholars?”</p>

<p>Uh.</p>

<p id="First">“Well… of course!  I am The First Among Scholars, after all.  It behooves me to be well informed on all manner of topic… and, in these days, knowledge of the Lowlands is, of course, of chief importance among those topics!”</p>

<p>They smile, the same light, almost-absent smile, which appears and disappears in unison.  </p>
<p>Well, that’s… okay.</p>

<p id="grey">“That is most gratifying to hear, First Among Scholars.  Thanks to that, I believe that, yes, you will be able to help us.”</p>

<p id="white">“Are you familiar with the Lowlander Ritual known as the ‘Annual Potluck’?  We have a great interest in this ritual.”</p>

<p id="First">“...Yyyyess.  I am familiar with it.  Intimately so; I have attended several in the past.  Indeed, at this point, more than any other Crag, if I am counting correctly, and I know full well that I am.”</p>

<p id="grey">“Such expertise must have been hard-earned.  We would be most appreciative if you could tell us all about it… but, to begin with, would you happen to know where the next celebration is to be held?”</p>

<p>That’s a… pretty specific question.  </p>
<p id="First">“Err… yes.  It is to be held in Asavardi.  Uh, the home of the Winged Elves.  It seems traditional that the Potluck be held in the primary population center of the various sub-types, you see.”</p>

<p id="white">“And it is to be held on the First day of this coming Summer?”</p>

<p id="First">“...That is correct, yes.”</p>

<p> The two of them share a glance.  While you consider yourself a fairly skilled hand at reading intent from other elves… a priceless skill in academia…  you get nothing at all from the exchange between these two.</p>

<p id="grey">“You had hoped to attend this upcoming Potluck as well, I assume?  It would seem you’ve made a regular outing of it, First Among Scholars.”</p>

<p id="First">“Well, yes, I had hoped to... “</p>

<p id="white">“Then, perhaps, if it is not too great a burden, you could accompany us?”</p>

<p id="grey">“We would be most appreciative.  We are keen to see more of the Lowlands, and the Otherelves who inhabit it.  However, we are not as knowledgeable about them and their customs as you are.”</p>

<p id="white">“It would be an immeasurable help to have one of your breadth of knowledge along, to ensure there are no misunderstandings, as well as to help introduce us to many of the Otherelf leaders, who we understand often attend such festivals.”</p>

<p id="First">“... I’m afraid I see a number of issues with that request.  I mean, first off, I have no idea who you are, so I could scarcely introduce you.  Sec-”</p>

<p id="grey">“Please forgive that oversight, First Among Scholars.  We are not accustomed to speaking with those who do not already know us.  I am Mountain Mother Selnah.”</p>

<p id="white">“And I am known as Mountain Mother Telerg.  We have been tasked by the Mountain Mother Superior with this task, so we may better understand the times we are living in and the people who inhabit them.”</p>

<p>So they are, indeed, Mountain Mothers… Elpahka.  You were aware that one of their number had been among the Crag who had descended last year… in fact, now that you think about it (to be honest, you don’t actually like thinking about it), you do remember her now, particularly that she was somehow able to keep a handle on Echo.  You’re pretty sure neither of them are the one who descended before… but if one of their number is capable of handling a beast like Echo, then you doubt any other beast the Lowlands could cough up could threaten them.  Of course, that still leaves the other issue...</p>

<p id="First">“... I’m afraid you may have misunderstood me.  I <i>hoped</i> to go to the Potluck, yes, but as I have recently found out, the Echo of Blood refuses to provide any Stalkers to guide my journey to the Potluck this year… and Asavardi is a great distance away.  While I would not object, per se, to your presence, without guidance I don’t believe there is much chance that we would arrive to the potluck… well, intact.”</p>

<p>Another glance.  Dammit, why can’t you read them?  Is it because they seem to be the same person?</p>
<p>...Wait, how does that make any sen-</p>
<p id="grey">“I believe that will be of no concern.  We will arrange for transport to the Potluck.”</p>

<p id="First">“...What? How?  Believe me, if you think you can sway Echo’s mind… well, you’d likely have sufficient trouble finding it, much less moving it to understand <i>reason</i>.  Believe me, I have already well exhausted that avenue.”</p>

<p id="white">“That will not be an issue.  We are aware of other methods of traversing the Lowlands.  Indeed, we actually were already planning to use these to attend the Potluck… but it is most beneficial to have one such as yourself who can not only confirm its location, but also ensure that there are no misunderstandings.”</p>

<p>...Another method?  </p>

<p id="First">“...What other meth-”</p>

<p id="grey">“It is nothing you need overly concern yourself about… in particular, not here, where the wind may carry voices so far.”</p>

<p id="white">“Suffice to say that it should ensure that you will arrive at this potluck, and perhaps many future ones, in spite of… difficulties you have had with the Aggro in the past.”</p>

<p id="grey">“All we would ask is your assurance that you will help us to understand the Otherelf mind, so we may better appreciate what we may witness and engage with once we arrive.”</p>

<p id="white">“Is that acceptable to you, First Among Scholars?”</p>

<p>...You furrow your brow.  What is it with people telling you not to concern yourself with <i>knowing things</i> today?  How can you believe-</p>

<p>Your thought process stops dead in its tracks, as a sudden realization washes over you.  Slowly, carefully, you look up.</p>

<p>...Well, no shooting stars, or eclipses, or, like, a cloud in the shape of an elf face that winks.  Indeed, the clouds are well below you, today.  Okay, so… maybe it’s more subtle than that.</p>
<p>In any case, you get the feeling… a really, <i>really</i> strong feeling… that you shouldn’t look a gift goose in the throat.</p>

<p id="First">“That is most acceptable.  Of course, I will inform you in anything you desire, as is my purview as Head of the Bakshish.”</p>

<p id="grey">“Most Gratifying, First Among Scholars.   You have done us a great service this day.”</p>

<p id="white">“Of course, as you are well aware, given the great distances involved, it would behoove us to begin our journey to the Potluck sooner, rather than later.  The better to avoid potential delays.”</p>

<p id="First">“...Sooner?  How soon?”</p>

<p id="grey">“We are planning on setting out tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p id="First">“<i>Tomorrow?!</i> But that’s not…”</p>

<p>...quick glance up…</p>

<p id="First">“… a problem.  No problem at all.  I’ll just… go get ready, then.”</p>

<p id="white">“That would be most wise, First Among Scholars.”</p>

<p id="grey">“We will attend to your office ere the morn, to begin our journey.” </p>

<p id="white">“I wish you a peaceful day, First Among Scholars.”</p>

<p id="grey">“And I as well.”</p>

<p>And with that, they turn… in unison, again… and retreat away from the Center, leaving you with a massive heap of confusion, questions, and concerns…  and, conversely, not a lot of options.</p>

<p>Once more, you look up to the sky.  And yet, once more, there’s nothing to-</p>

<p><i>Is that a shooting sta</i> goose.  It’s a goose.  Just a normal cragoose.</p>

<p>...You get the sneaking suspicion that, unfortunately, you’ve managed to find a <i>new</i> thing to be paranoid about.</p>
<hr>
<p>“And he has accepted our offer?”</p>

<p id="orange">“Yes, <b>Mountain Mother Superior</b>.  What is more, it is clear he has knowledge from the Lowlands that he could not have gained during his last outing;  He was aware that the Winged had pronounced their home to be the next location.”</p>

<p>“So it must be true… he must be the one to hold <i>The Feather</i>.  Most fortuitous.”</p>

<p id="orange">“Should I instruct the Mothers to attempt to retrieve it, Mother Superior?”</p>

<p>You gesture the negative.  “There is no need, Mother Inferior Basalt.  I have come to believe that our aims and those of the First are similar; both of us wish to know more of the Lowlands.  In time, we should have no difficulty convincing him to use <i>The Feather</i> to our advantage… whether he realizes it, or otherwise.”</p>

<p id="orange">“Most Wise, Mother Superior.  Is there any more you require?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more, Mother Inferior.  You are dismissed.  Give my favor to Mothers Telerg and Selnah.  Their handling of this matter was impeccable.”</p>

<p id="orange">“Of course, Mother Superior.  Peace in these times.”</p>

<p>“And for all who come after.”</p>

<p>With her departure, you are left in your personal chamber.  Alone, you once more allow yourself a brief flash of contentment;  should the First Among Scholars serve the purpose you believe he shall, then the troubles you have encountered during your Mothers’ visit to the Fires should largely be a thing of the past.  While you have little doubt he overstates his qualifications, the fact remains that few other Crag could provide such insight into the Lowlander Tribes as he can.</p>

<p>You run your hand over the documents resting upon your desk.  You have consumed the knowledge they brought several times already, as have the other Mother Inferiors… every word you have read only further confirms your suspicions of the Times you live in, but others still remain to be convinced.  You have no doubt that further information from the Winged, especially aided by the punctilious records of the Chief among the Bakshish, will help to sway more.   As far as you are concerned, however, you have already seen all that you need; The Contingencies are clear.  This is the Time of the Descension.</p>

<p>...And, yet, perhaps part of that confidence comes from a privilege that you have most immediate access to.  Perhaps, if the others could see… but no.  The Tradition is clear, and Stoneclad.  While the Inferior may know, only the Superior may see.  The fact that you defied this tradition… well, it was merely another feature of the odd Times you live in.</p>

<p>Now, however, you can travel to that precious place freely… and, indeed, you find yourself going through the motions once more.  The panel beneath the shelf.  The depression, next to the desk.  The hinge, only now revealed, but even so concealed within the hearth.</p>

<p>The passageway, secret, built into the room of the Mountain Mother Superior.  The only passage remaining, into the Catacombs.</p>

<p>The hidden door closes behind you as you descend the narrow, shallow stairs, a glowing crystal lighting your passage.  At first, the significance of this difficult descent had eluded you; it is only after repeated trips that the truth became evident.  The path is not narrow, nor the steps shallow; it is that the Elves they were constructed for did not possess the mighty stature of the Crag.   Such is the age of this ancient passage;  it truly dates back to the times of the Earliest Generations.</p>

<p>Step by shallow step, you descend, until the tight circle opens into an expanse of darkness.  In the dim illumination of your crystal, nothing can be seen but pitch black, not for many more stairs, but in time, the forms become evident… and unmistakable.</p>

<p>By Ancient Tradition, the Crag do not remember their dead.  No tombstones are made, no sepulchres willed.  It is a symbol of the purpose of the Crag, of what they hold most dear; while it is right to Honor the ancestors, the Crag are not meant to venerate them as individuals, but as a collective host, their progenitors, who have given them all the gifts of The Path… and, some day, whom all Crag will join, up until the time of the Final Generation.  It is a symbol of the Crag devotion, not to the past, but to the future.  And so it is that the fallen are disposed without memorial, the flesh of their bodies burned or taken by exposure, their bones returned to the very soils which fed them, or scattered into the mountain valleys, or ground into the mortar used to build their home anew.  These, the departed, have joined the Host of the ancestors, their names forgotten, but their Legacy Set in Stone, carried on in all the works and trials that they completed to allow the Crag to continue along The Path.</p>

<p>But, in these ancient halls, it is clear that this Ancient Tradition was not always the way.  The Catacombs make that clear.</p>
<p>Halls and halls, rows and rows of narrow recesses.  Close to this entrance, the recesses are perfect, flawless; the final catacombs made, bearing evidence of will, and peerless stonecraft.  Further cementing their relative youth are the remains which still reside within; thin bones, by Crag standards, and yet thicker than those possessed by the Lowlanders.  These remains have rested here, undisturbed, for untold Generations.  You see no reason to change that fact.</p>

<p>You press onward, deeper and deeper into the catacombs.  They are vast, and vaulting; who can say how many were laid to rest in this place?  The deeper you go, the cruder the internment, and the less that remains to mark their existence.  It is here where Names begin to appear, inscribed in red pigment… some familiar, others alien.  Balish.  Hector.  Androphel.  Mektel.  One marred, unreadable; what crime did they commit?  Or was this an act of Humility?  Sophie.  Balor.  Rosus.  Rivery.  Rivery, once more; what does it mean, to have the same name, so close?</p>

<p>Are these Bloodnames?  Personal names?  Something else entirely?  Who can know?  Who can say?  The dead are silent.  </p>

<p>Deeper, and deeper still.  Names disappear once more; great age has stolen them.  Only smudges remain. The internments are barely worth the name, crude holes chiseled in haste; even considering the ancestors small stature, you can scarcely believe whole remains were interred in these jagged shelves.  So on, and so forth, the crudeness continues… until here, at the very end.</p>

<p>A massive wall, basalt, stretches upward out of sight;  no internments are hewn here.  Rather, the whole of the flat plane was dedicated to a message, ancient beyond measure, a message that few Crag even know exists.   This, more than any other, is the secret purpose of the Mountain Mothers;  You see to the Dead.  You see to the Living.  And you keep the ultimate secret; the Origin of the Tome.</p>

<p>All Crag know that the Tome was the product of the greatest minds of the First Generation, peerless geniuses, who peered through the veil of time and saw the way by which Elves could achieve Perfection; Perfect bodies, Perfect minds, Perfect souls.  Even now that The Tome has been lost, or perhaps merely scattered, the Crag still cling to the hope that this ancient lore has not been totally lost, has not been forgotten.   No matter what the truth of the Tome is, whether it can be remade, or recovered, this wall bears the Ancient Truth of the First Generation;  The Tome was not made of a vision of the Future.</p>

<p>In its time, the Tome was made of a Vision of the Present.</p>

<p>Figures lie etched in perfect relief upon the wall, their forms so beautifully rendered that one could mistake them for real.  Flawless bodies, radiant beyond description.  Eyes, glowing, represented by brilliant gemstones infused with eternal light.  And, alighting atop each of their brows, another gemstone; not an affectation, but a part of their very being, of which the ornamentation upon your own brow is but a distant reflection.  </p>

<p>Upon the wall, these beings stand as stark testament to what it was the First Generation sought to achieve; not a distant target of perfection, unclear and unknowable, but a tangible, extant Reality; The Perfect Elves.   The inscriptions upon the wall, written in an ancient script, tell of their majesty; Massive and powerful, they towered over the First Generation; Though their forms were bare, they could endure blade and hardship as readily as any armor.  They had made Stone a part of themselves, and themselves a part of the stone;  As timeless, as ageless.  They were Invincible.  They were Immortal.</p>

<p>It is these beings which The First Generation strove to emulate, to gift to all who would come after them, so that all of Elvenkind might know the majesty of being such a being, and thus cement their place over all the creatures of The World.  And so, with the Aid of the Perfect Elves, they laid The Path, they penned The Tome, and they and those who followed their truth of Perfection set to this great undertaking which, thus far,  has culminated in The Crag; not yet perfect.  Not yet complete.  And yet, not yet Lost, either.</p>

<p>You glide your palm over one of the perfect forms, the ripple and wave of their musculature soothing and exciting at the same time.  You glide it over one of their perfect faces, the gemstones of their eyes and brow cold and yet warm to the touch.  You glide it over the inscription which stands, chief among all others, as the Greatest Wisdom imparted by these beings, one which set aflame the First Generation, and still to this day sets a flame in your breast.</p>

<p class="bigger"><i>Perfection is not a lie.</i></p>


<p>A cold wind whistles through the empty catacombs.  It promises Everything.</p>

<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic</b>: <i>Slabal has waited long, and cannot wait any longer;  Eschaton must grow, and there is one final task remaining in renovation before she can work on Expansion.  While her efforts have thus far been focused on reinvigorating the separate elements of The Crag, she must now reinforce the fundamental reality; even operating at their best, no one Bloodline of the Crag can function without all of the others working to support it.  As such, the final task she has is, comfortingly, the most familiar; she must renovate the underlying transportation infrastructure of Eschaton, in order to ensure that roadways are perfectly laid, storehouses are ideally placed, and the mines and quarries, while largely exploited at this point, receive the infrastructure they need to properly and safely transport their raw goods to the various workshops and warehouses in which they will reside.  This final task will fundamentally tie all of the disparate elements of Eschaton into a single, unified whole, ensuring that there is no underlying flaw which will mar Eschaton’s progress forward, and onward, into the Next Generation.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Infrastructure(Enrichment)</b> Skill to replace the aspect Cast the Fifth Stone: Actualization with the aspect Ensemble Cast, representing all of the separate elements of Crag society and (what can be called an) economy working in close tandem.  While she is working with some subpar materials, her Onagi, who are still vitalized by their earlier expressions, and now well rested after nearly a year on low-impact work, should prove more than capable to the task; she will Invoke the aspect  Cast the Fifth Stone: Actualization to provide an additional proficiency die to this check.  Likewise, her previous work has already contributed to this penultimate push; the aspect provides an automatic Advantage on this roll.</p>

<p><b>Political</b>: <i>With the First Among Scholars now in tow, the Mountain Mothers know what their next destination must be: The Home of the Winged, Asavardi.  Though a long journey, the well-paid adventurers hired last season should be capable of at least identifying a workable path from Surt or Fort Álfyr to this distant location; at the very least, a fresh infusion of gemstones should help to encourage them to this goal, and perhaps more.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spycraft(Espionage)</b> skill to gather information on Asavardi, the home of the ‘Flappies’, although none of the Crag are willing to use such a… undignified term.  Continuing to lean on the Fire Elf adventurers hired last turn, they will spend a Fate point to Invoke the aspect Firey Friends to once again provide an additional proficiency die to this roll.</p>

<p><b>Military</b>: <i>The winter has passed, her Stalkers are rested, and there has even been opportunity to rotate in a few of the best of the new blood to help relieve several of the long-term casualties: Embebi could only be more prepared to continue her search if she somehow had the motivation that seems to have been mysteriously stolen by another group of Crag.  However, she’s not about to let this daunt her endeavors, and she launches herself once more into the dire terrain where she hopes the Wayward Kin have managed to cling to life.  And, while she’s not going to name names, she wouldn’t object to a little assistance if a certain six-letter-named Wolf were back up to full strength...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Pathfinding(Reconnaissance)</b> skill to search the single tile marked with a square, located in the dangerous area.  Once again, mountainous terrain blah blah feat blah boost die; she knows the drill.</p>

<p><b>Mental</b>: <i>What’s this?  Drivel, who pretty much expected that the First’s promise that he could pursue his own research agenda would be just another way of asserting his authority… actually finds himself left alone?  Free to proceed?  Well! Whoda thunk?  Hopefully(?), The First hasn’t been assassinated, or elfnapped by cultists, or subjected to some other gruesome fate, but for how, Drivel’s not going to look a gift cragoose in the throat.  Following up on his painstakingly assembled ritual, he works closely with Entrep, who seems plenty keen to work closely alongside him, in order to create a number of gardens and topiaries in the newly created Dejima district.  For right now, these are mostly for showing, not for growing, but decorative plants seem to be a good place to start testing, especially if some of the grown plants can be Lowland ones...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Mysticism(Magic)</b> skill to cast the ritual Moutain Loam upon Eparchy.  While theoretically, the loam should be practical for direct agricultural use, Drivel is more of a traditional Bakshish when not being driven by The First, and thus he prefers to test his magic dirt for a while before anyone eats something grown out of it.  At the very least, it’d be a good idea to first test on crageese...</p>

<p><b>End of Turn</b> </p>

<p><b>Results-</b></p>
<p><b>Economic</b>- Slabal has finally met her match, and her match is apparently substandard materials. Even though she has made a mistake, however, she is still Slabal. Even when she has made a mistake, her thorough planning keeps things from getting too far out of hand.</p>

<p>About halfway through the season, there is a structural collapse of a building under construction. Apparently, the low quality wood used in construction support scaffolds was not up to measured standards and broke, causing an incomplete support arch to fail and bring the whole structure down with it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Slabal had safety measures in place. Onagi rescue teams leapt into action before the dust had even settled. Quick coordination between Onagi to search the rubble and Will larger pieces into more manageable chunks, Samra to haul rubble away in an organized fashion, and Elpahka to tend the wounded, the construction team is pulled from the rubble almost immediately with very few serious injuries and no fatalities. It is an emergency plan that Slabal had written up years ago, and along with her city planning allowing more efficient rescue operations this prevents the disaster from being far, far worse.</p>

<p>Still, Slabal rechecks the construction done so far this season. With the unfortunate demonstration of the error in her calculations, it becomes clear that the construction done so far is unacceptable. It will become unstable in a few years, and likely collapse within decades.</p>

<p>The Onagi dutifully take down these new constructions. They will have to start over. There is much talk of the rivers, and hope that they are true to their word...</p>

<p><b>Political</b>- Well, this one got interesting.</p>

<p>The first phase of the Mothers' visit goes well. Most of the fire elf adventurers have wandered off for greener pastures by now, but a solid core has formed of about eight fire elves that seem to genuinely enjoy traveling with the Mothers. Better yet, they're actually competent. They get the Mothers to Asavardi easily.</p>

<p>Once there, they enter the city easily enough. The Winged Elves on the surface seem a trusting folk, but that's mostly surface deep. The Mothers are aware that they are being observed by guards for most of their visit. They also get a chance to examine the rumored magic ward that protect Asavardi. The sheer scale and power of the ward shocks the Mothers. This is not the work of a foolish or shortsighted people.</p>

<p>Once they have been brought into Asavardi proper, the Mothers find themselves apparently quite welcome. They don't have to apply any effort towards asking questions. The winged elves come to them, with regular citizens coming up to them and asking a dizzying array of questions about the Crag. While this concerns the Mothers, it seems that these elves are more than happy to answer questions about themselves.</p>

<p>Through these numerous conversations, the Mothers learn that the winged elves' greatest strength is also their greatest weakness: Curiosity.</p>

<p>At first, it could be mistaken for childlike naivety. They ask such simple questions, and so many. They seem like toddlers who respond to every question with "why?" Their culture is simple, in a way. Almost tribal in nature, with many aspects that are much like less civilized people.</p>

<p>One might think that weakness, until you see the real cause: Winged elves are hungry for knowledge. They have an inborn need to learn everything they can, and consume new information like an elf dying of thirst would drink from a pitcher. Worse, they are good at it. When a winged elf learns something, they immediately digest it, and apply its nutrients to everything else they know. They constantly catalog, categorize, and compare everything they know. No matter how much they learn, their hunger only increases.</p>

<p>This is why they seem to have trouble with the concept of "secrets." To them, hiding knowledge feels like hiding bread during a famine. It's unfair, it's cruel to hide this resource that sustains them. They must know, they must feed their insatiable curiosity, and damn the consequences. They want to consume knowledge and information for its own sake, and yet even that isn't what makes them truly dangerous.</p>

<p>The startlingly powerful ward, the cargo lifts, the garden walls, even the carvings on then cliffside that are eh, acceptable by Crag standards until the Mothers learn that no winged elf had ever worked with stone before four years ago, all of it points to the real answer:</p>

<p>What makes them truly dangerous is that they can achieve the impossible solely because they never bother to stop and consider whether or not it can be done.</p>

<p>Then, while the Mothers are compiling their list and preparing their assessments, something truly bizarre happens.</p>

<p>The fire elves prefer public eateries such as bars and taverns. This also gives the Mothers a good chance to meet average elves. Asavardi has many establishments like this, mostly small cliffside establishments that serve fresh food in bowls. Only one of these really has enough room for your gaggle of adventurers, and even then it's crowded.</p>

<p>It's during one of these crowded evenings one of your Mothers spots something. One of their adventurers is acting odd. He doesn't seem to remember a private conversation that they had earlier. Curious and concerned, she observes him quietly. She notices an odd shimmer to his skin, an odd flicker to his eyes.</p>

<p>This Mother knows magic. She extends her senses to find no hint of spells on the elf. Despite this, her mundane senses tell her this is clearly not the case. Her judgment tells her something is very, very wrong.</p>

<p>There is only one reason to both have an illusion spell on them and a spell to prevent detection: This elf is trying to sneak into Asavardi and possibly fool the ward. The Mother has heard rumors of a faction that operates in such a way.</p>

<p>She makes a decision. The safety of their kin aside, the potluck will be held here in a scant couple of weeks. Crag leadership will be present, and if this interloper intends harm that meeting is certainly their target. This interloper must be intercepted, for the safety of the Crag.</p>

<p>Doesn't mean she has to be stupid about it.</p>

<p>She waits patiently until a very brief pause in which there is plenty of background noise and every patron happens to be looking away from her, then hits the spy with a Dispel Magic. With an audible pop, the spell is broken and reveals a wolf elf clear as quartz.</p>

<p>The schist immediately hits the geese.</p>

<p>There are several seconds of stunned silence, followed by several very loud things: An ear piercingly loud screeching noise coming from the pants of a nearby winged elf (hopefully related to the ward,) the wolf elf spy letting out an emphatic F bomb, and one of the fire elf adventurers screaming "GET HIM!" at the top of her lungs.</p>

<p>In the ensuing extremely one sided barfight with nearly everyone trying to dogpile the wolf elf, someone gets it in their head that wolf elf spies have lots of concealed nastiness and screamed "STRIP HIM!" This leads to the wolf elf being violently disrobed by the mob, which actually does strip him of a few countermeasures.</p>

<p>This apparently does not stop the wolf elf from getting a Grease spell off, leading to a slicked up mostly nude and bruised wolf elf somehow slipping out from under the pile. He runs for the door with a potion in his hand and leaps for the railing outside.</p>

<p>As the wolf elf spy leaps off the huge drop into the canyon, a group of winged elves swoops down from above. Seconds later, they swoop back up with the wolf elf spy held in in a net like a flopping fish. They haul him off for Asavardi's town hall.</p>

<p>The winged elf guards lock down the tavern. They slowly question every elf that was present in the room. Thankfully, the purchased loyalty of the fire elf adventurers holds out,  as does the placid calm of the Mothers. The winged elves have no idea who hit the wolf elf with a dispel, or what you were up to here.</p>

<p>The winged elves are not willing to hold fellow elves captive without good reason. The Mothers are free to do what they will, though they decide against trying to learn more sensitive information about the winged elves as they are now clearly being watched at all times.</p>


<p><b>Military</b>- Sure enough, you get your six letter assistant. Embebi finds Vesnia at her base camp, with her scouts refreshed, resupplied, and ready. She had even acquired extra supplies in the hopes that you would cooperate again.</p>

<p>After a little tension from new recruits on both sides, the expedition begins again. The group follows the pass that Vesnia was nearly killed in months ago, using it to venture high into the viciously dangerous mountain peaks.</p>

<p>Things go well - very well. The weather is merciful and clear the first few weeks of the expedition. Both Embebi's and Vesnia's recruits integrate well with their units. The two groups of elves, finally trusting each other even if only in this deadly location, work together smoothly. A few Crag save some Wolves, a few Wolves save some Crag. Progress is made rapidly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nothing but empty mountain peaks is found. No sign of the wayward kin. This does, however, mean one thing: By process of elimination, there is only one area they could be in.</p>

<p>The team is ahead of schedule. Winter is far behind. Still, more than half their supplies are exhausted. The teams are pushing themselves to the edge of their fortitude as it is. Pushing on would be fraught with risk.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Embebi makes the call.</p>

<p>She is Unbound. They press on.</p>

<p>The extra burden of exploring such a distance in such extreme climes almost breaks the team - almost. Without Vesnia's help it wouldn't have been possible, but as they say almost only counts in flipstones and fireballs.</p>

<p>The team is stunned as they reach the goal they have been pursuing for so long. As Embebi summits a razor sharp ridgeline, she is shocked to see the absolute last thing she expected to see here: Green.</p>

<p>It's a Beyul. A sacred valley. A jewel amongst barren rock. A fertile oasis cut into the mountain face. A legend among Stalkers, spoken only in tall tales and myths. Something that Bakshish have long proven impossible, yet it seems their declarations did not change the mountain's opinion as there it sits.</p>

<p>Nestled in the center of the Beyul is a city. It is unmistakably Crag and unmistakably ancient. Stone structures willed into being long ago rise through the vegetation in the Beyul and form wide pathways through which movement can be seen - Crag elves, living out their lives in an impossible city long forgotten.</p>

<p>Embebi has done it. She has found the Wayward Kin.</p>

<p>Contact is made tentatively, then enthusiastically. These indeed are the wayward kin you have been tracking ever since Embebi found their tracks all those seasons ago. Under the guidance of a younger Elpahka named Uyltik and with the knowledge of an elderly Bakshish named Oygen (though neither of them are actually Named) this group fled the Extermination with the desperate hope of finding this lost city, its existence only hinted about in legends, and taking refuge where no one could reach them. Many died in the ascent, but they made it - and until today, thought themselves the last living Crag.</p>

<p>Oygen has one last gift: during the ascent, he took with him as many copied pages of the Tome as he could carry. It is dozens of pages, more than Embebi has found since she first laid eyes on a wayward page. It is a truly triumphant victory.</p>

<p>The city itself is a complete mystery. It is ancient and has been abandoned for some time. It is definitely Crag. Like most Crag architecture, it bears no names or words, only designs and references to history long forgotten. There are carvings of Crag faces, but they are thinner and more angular than ones familiar. Most are too worn to learn anything specific.</p>

<p>Even more curious, inside some of the larger buildings are entrances to a strange underground labyrinth. Disturbingly, every single passage deeper into the mountain has been thoroughly sealed off by Will. Without any markings at all, no one is sure why these ancient Crag felt the need to seal the tunnels with granite walls dozens of feet thick and then flee the city. None of them particularly want to find out. They have left them untouched.</p>

<p>The only thing that gives any hint to the identity of the Crag that once lived here is an ancient statue at the center of the city. Ten feet tall and carved from perfect white stone, the statue seems elegant and beautiful even though its finer features have long since worn away.</p>

<p>There are only two identifying attributes to it. One is a fist sized diamond set in the center of its forehead enchanted to glow brightly for all time.</p>

<p>The other is an inscription below the statue. It is carved in a truly ancient dialect of elven, but it was carved so bold and so deep it is still clearly legible even after so long. It reads:</p>

<p class="bigger"><i>Perfection is not a lie.</i></p>

<p>This territory has High Mountain Peaks as well as these terrain Aspects-</p>

<p>Beyul- There is a fertile valley cut into a saddle between two high peaks. A surprising amount of vegetation thrives there. It is a strenuous hike to reach it if you know where it is. It's extremely arduous and dangerous to get to if you don't.</p>

<p>Forgotten City- This long forgotten ancient city contains many secrets and perhaps many dangers. Though it has been abandoned for centuries or perhaps even millenia, the sheer quality of Crag architecture leaves it habitable.</p>

<p>In addition, in reward for Embebi having completed her years long quest, you have access to two more Aspects:</p>

<p>Wayward Kin representing the several hundred Crag refugees found huddled in the forgotten city.</p>

<p>Fragments of Perfection representing the single largest collection of copied pages from the Tome found since the Extermination.</p>

<p>In addition to that addition, it is up to Embebi what role Vesnia plays in this. It is possible to keep her role hidden, for now. Her team could camp covertly in the valley while Embebi's team interacts with the refugees. They could also stride into the forgotten city as big damn heroes, as these Crag don't know what a wolf elf is. That, or anything else Embebi can think of. Really, it's up to you.</p>

<p><b>Mental</b>- Speaking of schist hitting geese, Drivel is having a really, really bad time. Well, it could honestly be worse. In a theoretical sense </p>

<p>His decision to check the loam-grown food on craggeese first seems to have been a good idea. He gets a nice population (and a control) and controls their diet for a few weeks. Some are fed food grown in glass houses with magically generated loam, others are fed plants grown from the same seeds in glass houses with normal soil.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks, everything is fine… then the geese start, well… shitting. It starts with about half the experimental population. They defecate uncontrollably for days on end. It's a little comedic at first, then it becomes terrifying as they just… don't stop. Several of them die from inability to keep food in their bodies. Shit.</p>

<p>Drivel spends days going over the ritual, trying to figure out what went wrong. As his panic rises, he gets word: Now the control geese are shitting. What? That doesn't make any sense!</p>

<p>Then the researchers start.</p>

<p>A near panic sets in. Elpahka and Bakshish healers intervene, implementing plans formed during the worst days of the blight. Thankfully, they are able to keep it contained. No one suffers the same fate as the geese, though several researchers spend days in gastrointestinal distress.</p>

<p>Eventually, the problem is tracked down. Surprisingly, it has nothing to do with the ritual itself. One of the Samra workers tending the glass houses was not following correct protocol and spread an illness to the plants, which then got out of control. Thankfully, the disease seems to hit Crag a lot more softly than it hits geese.</p>

<p>While there are no permanent consequences, there is not enough time to complete the ritual and your mental action next turn will take a setback die due to general malaise amongst Bakshish.</p>

<p><b>Congratulations!</b> You have withstood another year in this untamed land! Four years ago, you were scarcely alive, huddling and dying in your crumbling home. You overcame the Blight. Slowly, you began to rebuild. You began to reforge your ruined home. You began to regain your lost future and past. You began to hope. You overcame hardship and violence.</p>

<p>The challenges are not done. The future is not certain. What is certain now is that you are on a path. You are no longer just surviving, you are beginning to thrive.</p>

<p>There are still many ways that things could go wrong - many threats, internal and external, that could tear you and your allies apart. These dangers are real and perhaps greater than ever.</p>

<p>The difference now is that you are beginning to see what the future might look like if you rise above them.</p>

<p>In addition to your standard yearly skill point, you have also gained a point of Refresh! It may be exchanged for a new stunt at this time.</p>

<p>Further, in recognition of overcoming incredible hardship and challenge this year (and perhaps setting off down a very dangerous road,) Embebi gains a level.</p>

<p>The Aggro are Awakening.</p>
<p>There is no other way to put it; while other Bloodlines had more consistent success this year, the Aggro are by far the Bloodline which has spent the most time Becoming this year.  From Echo’s necessary lessons in warcraft, to Embebi’s perilous journey, to those Aggro who have learned to love Steel, to those once lost who have now found kinship as Aggro, whatever they may have once been.  What’s more, the greatest thing that has Awakened in them is an awareness that their work is not done.  At varying points, both Echo and Embebi have spoken the same words; the Aggro must prepare for Conflict, from any quarter.  They must not let themselves become complacent.  They must become harder, faster, stronger, better.</p>
<p>And so, they shall.</p>
<p>In recognition of lessons learned and futures warned, this year’s skill point is awarded to the Aggro, who immediately place it into Military Science in the hopes of converting more of their number from Rank and File Aggro into Specialists.</p>
<p>But to become a specialist is not the peak of Aggro achievement; while these warriors are respected for their dedication to a specific path, there is always room for improvement, opportunities to cleave closer to Perfection.  None know this better than Echo of Blood, who has dedicated the whole of his being to becoming more powerful with each passing year.  Now, after his experiences with the Talcsome Stalkers, and his tutelage from the greatest of the Blades, he is prepared to impart his dedication onto others.</p>
<p>The available point of Refresh is being (tentatively) traded for an ambitious new stunt;  Polish to Perfection.</p>
<p id="darkgreen" class="big">Polish to Perfection</p>
<p>To an Aggro, the concept of “Training” is inseparable from the concept of ‘Living’.  There are always improvements to make, always new skills to master, always new limits to surpass.  This is as true of those who have dedicated themselves to a Specialization as it is to the Rank and File; though they may have been recognized for their dedication, their quest for perfection is never complete. Through this cultural demand for self improvement, the Crag allow for hardships in training that most others would balk at.  By these methods, those who may have been found wanting when first mustered may, through months or years of dedication, make themselves the equals to those of more natural talents.</p>
<p>This Feat allows for a specialized use of the Support trapping of the Military Science skill; Through this feat, they may apply the “ ‘Experienced I’ “ (extra quotes on purpose) Aspect on any Unit of 2nd level or lower.  This Aspect does not grant the normal benefit of Experienced; instead, it’s only purpose is that it functions as the Experienced I Aspect for purposes of using the Fundamentals Trapping to increase the level of all units in a Division.  However, this Aspect may not be applied to a specific unit more than once per year, and only one copy of this Aspect may be applied to a unit at any given time.</p>
