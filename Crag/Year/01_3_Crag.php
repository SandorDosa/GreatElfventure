Normally, when something like this happens, the Elpahka and the Bakshish can work together to eliminate it by curing all the diseased plants. &nbsp;That didn&rsquo;t work on the Blight. &nbsp;So, instead, we just destroyed the infected plants when we found them. &nbsp;Bizarrely, that didn&rsquo;t work either! Even with no trace of it left, the Blight would return. &nbsp; We bandied all sorts of ideas&hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s being blown in from somewhere else, or maybe it&rsquo;s really hard to see it early on and lots of infected plants are left in the fields, or maybe even it&rsquo;s being carried by </span><span class="c6 c11">disease spirits</span><span class="c6">, I do not jest, someone suggested this with all sobriety. &nbsp; But your Gardens, separated as they were, provided the telling evidence!<br><br>Separated out into numerous planters, these crops were close to each other, but didn&rsquo;t share the same soil and water as the other plants around them. &nbsp;Then, when the blight struck them, rather than it wiping out all the crops in an area, it would just infect the crops </span><span class="c6 c11">in that planter</span><span class="c6">. That made it obvious! </span><span class="c6 c11">The Blight is in the soil!</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp; &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c22 c25 c24"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">You look at him coldly. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t mean anything by it, that&rsquo;s just how you look at people when you aren&rsquo;t paying attention. &nbsp;And you certainly aren&rsquo;t right now. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not entirely sure about his logic, but some parts do ring true; after all, the soil placed in the planters and gardens came from the fertile plateaus, so it could have been carried that way. &nbsp;You aren&rsquo;t sure about his assertion that only one planter would catch it at a time&hellip; however, you weren&rsquo;t really paying attention to that at the time. &nbsp;After all, that was the Samra&rsquo;s job. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4"><br>However, looking at his illustration of how the disease could travel&hellip; perhaps by air, perhaps by water, perhaps by soil... you&rsquo;re starting to get an idea.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">&ldquo;...nd thus the only possible solution to the Blight is simply to </span><span class="c6 c11">escape</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;it, starting up agriculture in another fertile valley, and evidently identifying one cannot be left to someone with the men</span><span class="c6 c11">tal capacity of a-</span><span class="c7 c6">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c22 c25 c24"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c22 c23">&ldquo;The ways the Blight can travel. &nbsp;They all seem to be natural ways. &nbsp;You are certain that it is not magical?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c22 c23"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">He&rsquo;s nonplussed again. &nbsp;You try to make a note of it, he probably doesn&rsquo;t enjoy having that happen. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s odd; you&rsquo;ve seen him talk over any number of Bakshish trying to get a word in edgewise. &nbsp;Why is he surprised when you interrupt him?</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">&ldquo;...The other Bakshish just spent months investigating that possibility. &nbsp;While that by no means is a </span><span class="c6 c11">guarantee</span><span class="c22 c24 c25">, I&rsquo;d say that it makes the chance remote. &nbsp;Hopefully, if they listen to me this time, they&rsquo;ll put their heads to more productive investigations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c22 c25 c24"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">You nod. &nbsp;The idea has taken root. &nbsp;If the Blight must travel by natural means, then would it be possible to protect the crops by sheltering them from the elements, as you would shelter people from hail or driving sleet? &nbsp;Of course, even you can immediately see the issue with that. &nbsp;They would still need water, soil, and light to grow. &nbsp;Water could be handled easily&hellip; rainwater and mountain dew could merely be transported directly, as one does in the driest times. &nbsp;Soil is a bit trickier, but if it travels in soil as he says, then soil that was proven to grow crops without death should be sufficient. &nbsp;Light, however&hellip; would torches work? Candles? &nbsp;Probably not. &nbsp;And the fire hazard would be immense, in any regard.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The First coughs loudly. &nbsp;Right. &nbsp;Prioritize.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">...His plan has merit. &nbsp;The Blight is here. &nbsp;So, go to where the Blight is not. &nbsp;He is also likely correct that the Esteemed does not respect him. &nbsp;She calls him young, a child. &nbsp;Granted, he is young, and is childish. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">But children can be wise also.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c22 c23">&ldquo;I see. &nbsp;I can help you. &nbsp;If you intend to travel as the Aggro do, you will need equipment to protect you. &nbsp;Remove your robes. &nbsp;I will need to see your shape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c22 c23"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">He hesitates, but then does as you ask. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t blame his hesitation. &nbsp;It is the cold months. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">...Hrm. &nbsp;This will be a challenge. &nbsp;His robes mask it well, but his frame is small, smaller than you even suspected. &nbsp;However, he isn&rsquo;t scrawny; his musculature isn&rsquo;t defined, like some, but it is apparent. &nbsp;Wiry. &nbsp;That can be an advantage. &nbsp;However, his short stature and small frame means that typical stone would be inappropriate. &nbsp;You may be able to repurpose some sparring gear, embroider it, make it appear to be fit for war.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">You grab his hand, twisting it around, observing how his fingers move, his thumb bends, his arm flexes. &nbsp;His digits are stained with red. &nbsp;His wrist, supple, flexible. &nbsp;His elbows are oddly calloused. &nbsp;Yes, a thrusting weapon would be best. &nbsp;You can modify a kuthe, give it some simple ornamentation. He will also need a hunter&rsquo;s bow. &nbsp;Perhaps one of the ones you made after you realized your mistake. &nbsp;You wish you had realized it sooner.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">He&rsquo;s shivering, now. &nbsp;His skin has turned to gooseflesh. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s becoming flushed. &nbsp;Odd. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t think it that cold in your workshop. &nbsp;He may also need some extra down or wool to help. &nbsp;Some additional measurements might help, but there is no sense in prolonging his suffering. &nbsp;You should be able to make a start of it.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c22 c23">&ldquo;That is sufficient. &nbsp;I believe I can make equipment that will make your intentions clear to the Esteemed. &nbsp;I will have them ready for fitting tomorrow afternoon. &nbsp;Return then and it will just be a matter of final adjustments. &nbsp;You can go now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c22 c23"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c22 c23">&ldquo;You will want to take your robes with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c22 c23"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Odd, that. &nbsp;You thought he was cold. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t understand how he could forget them. &nbsp;Perhaps he was thinking on other things. You know you&rsquo;re prone to that. &nbsp;The physical world can seem such an inconvenience when there are other things to consider. &nbsp;One task at a time. &nbsp;You have a kuthe on hand in your shop, but for the armor, you will need to go to the warehouse, get some additional leather panelling, sinew, and wool. &nbsp;You have other tasks, but none seem as pressing as this. &nbsp;The promise of a solution to the Blight seems of the utmost importance.<br><br>You leave your workshop, entering the brisk, crisp air. &nbsp;The perfectly fitted stones feel cold beneath your feet. &nbsp;You enjoy that sensation. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not sure why. &nbsp;Your breath puffs in the air, and you can already feel your sinuses drying. &nbsp;You enjoy that sensation less. &nbsp;Around you, you can hear the wind whistling, but unfortunately, what you can also hear are unwelcome sounds. &nbsp; Hacking. &nbsp;A Samra carrying a basket of linens coughs wetly into their hand. &nbsp;Another sweeping filth snorts, and expectorates. &nbsp;You can remember a time when illnesses like these were cause for immediate attention, as no Crag should bear such infirmity without concern. &nbsp;Now, starving, few in number, such sickness is common, opportunities to convalesce rare. &nbsp;A susurration of sickness echoes through Echelon. &nbsp;You enjoy that sensation least.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">As you often do when you encounter unpleasant sensations, you turn your attention to the surrounding architecture. &nbsp;The legacy of your ancestors always serves to remind you that setbacks such as these are temporary. &nbsp;In all the time that the Crag have existed, your ancestors must have faced these same trials, or worse, and yet you are still here, proof of your people&rsquo;s capacity for endurance. &nbsp;The strong, stone walls of the Maker&rsquo;s District, flagstones woven together through masterful application of will. &nbsp;The pavingstones you travel, slotted so closely together that no mortar could hope to improve them. &nbsp;The rivulets, designed to funnel the dew and those rains which reach high enough into the reservoirs of the lower slopes, worn smooth by the water they channel. &nbsp;The lanternposts, shining day and night, their enchanted flame dancing behind perfectly pure quartz mantles, as strong as it was since the day it was created. &nbsp; In the distance, the walls which&hellip;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">You stop in your tracks.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">You look back at the lantern next to you. &nbsp;At the pure, pristine flame, illuminating all around it from within it&rsquo;s protective shell of quartz. &nbsp;Unlike true fire, it requires no air to breathe, and so the ancestors, in their wisdom, encased it fully in pure, untainted quartz, shaped into beautiful designs by the will of Onagi long passed.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4"><br>Pure, untainted, completely transparent quartz.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Water to drink. &nbsp;Soil to rest in. &nbsp;Light to grow.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">...You must complete the First&rsquo;s raiment quickly. &nbsp;There is other work to pursue.</span></p><hr><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">You feel stiff. Without question, part of that is because you have maintained your current seated pose for hours now. &nbsp;However, the stiffness is far better than the pain you would experience if you moved. &nbsp;That seems to always be the way of things. &nbsp;There is no option to fully alleviate suffering. &nbsp;There are only the choices which may choose a lesser suffering over a greater.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Your eyes open, revealing the cloudy nightscape of Eschaton. &nbsp;Whether it is cloudy in truth or merely your damned eyes again is difficult to discern. &nbsp;You should see to those, allow yourself to uncloud them, but&hellip; you can&rsquo;t help but shake the feeling that you deserve this. &nbsp;After all, what has been the cause of so many ills lately but your clouded, shortsighted judgement? &nbsp;Your repeated farce of leadership? &nbsp;The others look to you for wisdom, but for every triumph, you bring equal or greater disaster. &nbsp;Thus, is it not just that your sight should become as occluded as your foresight? &nbsp;Is it not a sign of the gods&rsquo; will that no matter how many times you clear your sight, it becomes shaded once more? &nbsp;Perhaps if you let them fail, let yourself slip into true infirmity, another would come to take your place&hellip;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c11">Enough</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">These are no times for such melodrama. &nbsp;You should know better. &nbsp;To presume to know the will of the gods is not only the truest vanity, it is also the truest folly. &nbsp;No, this is not divine punishment. &nbsp;It is merely yet another toll that must be paid for a life so long lived, another trial you must overcome. &nbsp;Perhaps, for that reason, it is better to have passed soone-</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c26 c8 c11">Enough</span><span class="c7 c8 c26">.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c7 c26 c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The movement pains you, but you flex your arm, contort your digits. &nbsp;Your dry lips crack open, a low, familiar chant issuing forth. &nbsp;You place your palm against the bridge of your nose. &nbsp;The time for wallowing in self pity is over.</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Your eyes burn. &nbsp;It is one of a million pains you have endured. &nbsp;Gods willing, it will be one of a million more you have yet to endure. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c17">You are the </span><span class="c26 c8">Esteemed Elpahka</span><span class="c17">!

Quartz is something in no short supply, and the surviving texts have quite a bit of information in them on purifying quartz to be translucent as well as the construction of the everburning lanterns. Your stoneshapers are able to select quite clear grades of quartz and through careful crafting flatten and fuse them into panes that are as translucent as the highest quality glass.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Constructing the glass houses turns out to be little more difficult than scaling up the design philosophy of the lanterns.

The Aggro and Bakshish pathfinders, for once in their damned lives, actually get it together and cooperate to use the best of their strengths. The memory of their previous embarrassing failures in the back of their minds, they attack the expedition with uncommon gusto. Indeed, their surveys are detailed and thorough and they complete the entire expedition accurately and ahead of schedule!</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">Now, the bad news: If the First&rsquo;s theory about nearby fertile valleys is correct, there aren&rsquo;t any in the territories scouted. They find barren, craggy, harsh stone along an unforgiving mountainside. This is of course not to say they return empty handed. Far from it, they are able to gather a large amount of hunted or trapped game - mostly mountain goats and birds. It&rsquo;s not a massive amount of food, but every little bit help.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Now, for the uh&hellip; </span><span class="c10 c11">interesting</span><span class="c7 c10">&nbsp;news.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">The square directly to the east of Escahton contains the </span><span class="c10 c11">Foothills</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c10 c11">Steep Cliffsides</span><span class="c7 c10">&nbsp;aspects. Basic minerals like iron, quartz, and granite can be mined there if so desired. That&rsquo;s not the most interesting thing in the territory. High up in the northernmost section of the territory, the expedition discovers a concealed cave.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">In this cave, they find what was once a small dwelling. Strewn about it are the remnants of inhabitation - old kettles, the remains of an improvised hearth, some rotted food stores (typical,) a few bits of old bedrolls and camping gear and the like.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">Strewn about the cave are also the remnants of the inhabitants - specifically about 12 hobgoblins. Judging by the condition of the bodies, they died weeks or months ago at least. And boy, they sure did die quick. It seems there was a fight here. A very one-sided fight. The hobgoblins are so badly injured that it appears they were essentially dismembered, and the cuts are far too clean and deliberate to be an animal attack.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">The fact that their heads have all been severed and stacked in a neat pile is also a hint that this isn&rsquo;t the work of an animal. Each head, along with an expression of terror and agony, has a strange symbol burned into their faces. The symbols are all the same, and they are a runic form of the Lycan language. This runic form is very rare and quite different from normal written Skaplyndi.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">(If someone speaks Lycan, it&rsquo;s a DC 15 to translate. If not, it&rsquo;s DC 25)</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c19 c24">The rune is actually two separate runes layered on top of eachother. </span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c10 c19"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c19 c24">One rune is &ldquo;hefja bl&oacute;t,&rdquo; a rune meaning essentially &ldquo;to sacrifice a heathen in worship of Luna.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c19 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c19 c24">The other rune is &ldquo;ey&eth;ask,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;come to naught, wasted, purged.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c19 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c10">Your expedition wisely nopes the fuck out of there.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">The northeastern square contains more barren rock, having the aspect </span><span class="c10 c11">High Mountains. </span><span class="c7 c10">Near the exact center of the square, they find a massive several mile wide crater. Most interestingly, they find that when they step into the crater rim their everburning lamps immediately extinguish. After a little panic and backing up, the lamps come back on. A little further examination reveals that the entire crater is a null magic zone.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Further examination of the crater reveals scattered fist-sized dark green crystals of a type no one in the group has ever seen before. How exactly they or the crater got there is anyone&rsquo;s guess for now, but it seems that the crystals take a small amount of the crater&rsquo;s antimagic effects with them. Upon examining them, the First recognizes the crystals as an extremely rare type of stone the ancients described long ago as </span><span class="c10 c11">Noqual.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">This square contains the Aspects </span><span class="c10 c11">High Mountains, Antimagic crater,</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c22 c13 c11">Noqual Deposit.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">While none of this helps directly address the famine, the extra food brought on return is a small boon. The next </span><span class="c13 c8">Recovery</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;check to mitigate the Blight&rsquo;s damage will get a </span><span class="c13 c8">boost die.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c8">Mental- </span><span class="c22 c13 c24">The First&rsquo;s hunch to examine the soil as a vector turns out to be correct. Indeed, the Blight thrives and expands itself in warm damp soil. Critically, even small amounts of soil can propagate the Blight. Even the small amount a gardener carries under their fingernails and on their boots can spread the Blight, and even a small amount of contamination is fatal to a crop. Thankfully this is discovered early enough to save the quartz gardens.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">After this revelation, the more paranoid researchers go off on a hunch. It proves fortuitous, as they manage to learn something very interesting about the Blight: While for all intents and purposes it acts as a normal crop blight, it is somehow resistant to magic. Purify food and drink doesn&rsquo;t always work, and even food that has been magically purified can contain and spread the blight. There is little precedent for a blight with such a dire adaptation, and it only fuels theories about the blight&rsquo;s dark origins.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">Mercifully, the Blight can&rsquo;t exist long without a plant to devour. Even in soil, it can only last for a few weeks. Carried on a person or in water, a day or two at most.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Thanks to all this new information, further attempts to kill the Blight will get a </span><span class="c7 c13 c8">bonus die.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c13 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13 c8">Event: The Blight</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c13 c8">Status: Ongoing</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c8 c13"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">The Blight is a thing without mercy or empathy. Though you have made great progress in fighting it, crops still die and bellies go empty. You take the normal stress damage from the blight this turn. Even the stony stoicism of the crag elves is starting to show cracks.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c10">The situation is even worse in reality than the public knows. Quietly, the First does his own personal calculations. Despite calculating the numbers dozens of times he comes to the same grim conclusion. The Blight could disappear immediately leaving all healthy crops untouched and Eschaton would still starve. Even if every single precious ancient heirloom grain is devoured, no matter what is done to extend supplies, simply too much damage has been done to Eschaton&rsquo;s food infrastructure to recover with what you have now. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c22 c13 c24">Unless the crag elves find an external source of food (and soon), Eschaton is doomed in the long run.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c22 c13 c24"></span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c7 c20 c8"></span></p></body>
