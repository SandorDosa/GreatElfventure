    <p>A cold wind whips over the mountainside.  Cold enough that you can feel the sting; hardly surprising, since all the hardwood are going to various projects of dubious utility... although even you will admit that the Gardens were an impressive idea, maybe even pivotal to proving some theories of your own.  If you heard correctly, it was The Layer who suggested them.  Ah, it's good to know that at least one other person given a name has the capacity to actually deserve it! And it hardly surprises you, given how talented, and patient, and collected, and graceful, and built, and...</p>
    <p>Your cheeks are getting warmer.  Dammit.  You desperately hope the Oaf doesn't spot it.</p>
  
    <p>You are The <b>First</b>, and you think you may be so angry that you've come out the other side and now are just hungry.  Not that that's an unfamiliar feeling right now, unfortunately.  Indeed, the last several months have pretty much just involved you vacillating between Angry and Hungry and more than a couple times just being Hangry.  It might have been unpleasant, but boy, it seems you're productive when you're Hangry.  </p>
    <p>You point to yet another unintelligible mark on the sheet in front of you.</p>
    <p id="First">"...And what, in this Fresh Green Hell, is this supposed to be?  It looks like a... like a spider?  Atop a spear?"</p>
    <p>The oaf leans down (because of course he does) to inspect the mark, rubs his enormous chin for a moment, and then snaps his fingers.  </p>
    <p id="Echo">"Ah, yes! I remember! That's the wilting tree! There were many of them down there, but that one was the <i>Biggest</i> we saw, and it was an important landmark! It was right next to..."</p>
    <p>He slams his grotesque slab of finger down onto the useless document.  At the very least, the added crumpling doesn't make it any <i>more</i> useless.</p>
    <p id="Echo">"...This bog, where an enormous creature was assaulted and slain!  I think it was an enormous cave lizard! Or maybe an enormous cave fish?  In any case, it was enormous, and also very salty."</p>

    <p>That's it.  That tears it.  You definitely just got so angry that it came out the other side, lapped itself, and ended on <i>Unreasonably Fuck-Ass Mad.</i></p>
    <p>You crumple the offensive document in front of you, a small keening noise escaping your lips in spite of yourself, and then hurl it at his face!  </p>
    <p>... And misjudge the distance to the face.  It slaps against his broad chest, then flaps back onto the table, the vellum even further wrinkled, the ink even more stained, and yet, amazingly, still no more useless. No matter! You aren't about to let a little thing like that stop you! This has been a long time coming!</p>
    <p id="First">"<i>You Ox-eyed, Mushbrained, Shale-handed Simpleton! We didn't send you down there on a Fucking SAFARI! You were supposed to find new sources of food for our people! Plainlands! Marshlands! Local foragable flora!  Potentially tameable fauna! Why in the hell is this nothing but a bunch of dotted lines, fucked-up trees, and MONSTER HUNTS?!</i>"</p>
   
    <p>You gasp for air, your hunger temporarily forgotten, fed instead by adrenaline.  You hate to admit it, but it feels <i>good</i> to be this angry.</p>
    
    <p>His massive mossy brows clash together in thought.  You're tempted to launch into another tirade, but you figure you'll give him a chance to embarrass himself.  At last, he points his finger directly at you, a cross look on the outcropping he calls a face.</p>
    
    <p id="Echo">"You said that this was an exple... an explOration to find food for our people, something fit for us to eat.  When travelling in the lowlands, our best meals were monsters.  So, I found where the monsters were.  Why are you upset?"</p>
    
    <p>You stare at him, then the crumpled vellum, then back at his hurt/upset expression, and then the document for just a moment longer.  Then, with exaggerated care, you put your elbows up on the table. </p>
    <p>First one.</p>
    <p>Then the other.</p>
    <p>You place your hands together, palms outstretched.</p>
    <p>Slowly, you lower your head into your waiting hands, where it comes to rest.</p>
    
    <p>You remain in that position until Echo feels awkward/bored/awkword and leaves.</p>
    
    <p>And for half an hour afterward.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p id="First">"<i>Useless, useless, useless, utterly USELESS!</i> I knew this was going to happen.  I tried to warn the Esteemed.  But <i>noooo</i>, she needed me here, keeping the rest of the Bakshish in line, stopping them from crying long enough to get some actual work done! And now, we've squandered a whole 3 months on Echo's <i>Demonic Shopping Trip</i>. As if we could have expected anything else!"</p>
    
    <p>The First is talking again.  He seems to do that a lot.  Strangely, he doesn't really ever care to achieve much with his words.  You understand.  Sometimes, you can use water for crops, or to spin a wheel, or to hone a blade.  But sometimes, you just need it to stop a fire.  </p>
    
    <p>The First always seems to be putting out fires.  Maybe he should stop feeding them so much.</p>
    <p>...That analogy probably got away from you.   You can confidently state that you have problems with maintaining long analogies.  Because you are <b>Slabal.  </b>And if nothing else, you are confident in where your limitations lie.  It's hard to forget, since you're currently holding one.</p>
    
    <p>The bow in your hands is a fine work of craftselfship.  When you started working on it, you became engrossed, obsessed, making sure every detail was attended to, every possible advantage given.  The dustar is finely carved.  The ox horn is smoothed.  The leather finish will protect the delicate glue from everything except complete immersion.  Seeing your work, the other Onagi could not help but want to emulate it.  It was not merely a weapon.  It was an artwork.  It was, in a word, Beautiful. </p>
    
    <p>Too bad it's Useless.  </p>
    <p>You kind of hope that that stops being a motif for you.</p>
    
    <p>Well, Useless is perhaps a bit of an exaggeration.  It is not trash or scree.  Some, the strongest of the Aggro, would be able to make a fine weapon out of it.  However, as a tool for the Samra hunters, it is a poor fit; few of their number are even capable of drawing this bow. Which also makes it a poor fit for the fuming Bakshish in front of you. Probably.  Maybe his frame has hidden strength to it?  You should check.</p>
    
    <p id="First">"...the dense clod didn't even bring any samples of his bestial buffet back! I swear-"</p>
    
    <p id="Slabal">"Here.  Take this.  Draw it back as far as you can."</p>
    
    <p>He stares at you, nonplussed for a moment, but then gingerly takes the bow from your hand.  It's clear he understands the basics of using it, adopting the orthodox stance, and as he tugs on the drawstring...<br>
    Nothing.  Not even slightly.  He tries again, grunting with effort.  He manages to get it about a quarter of the way back before you hold your hand up.</p>
    
    <p id="Slabal">"Stop.  It's not a good fit.  I wanted to see what would be.  You'll need a lighter poundage... what are you hoping to achieve, in any case?"</p>
    
    <p>The string twangs as he releases it.  Although he was full of stormy rage moments ago, he now seems somewhat chagrined.  You're not sure why, but at least he may be more comprehensible.  He sighs.</p>
    
    <p id="First">"...The Esteemed doesn't take me seriously.  She thinks I'm too young, too eager.  Probably even foolish, which is a laugh, considering who she first chose.  But after observing the results of the Temple Gardens... Which, I must emphatically state, was a <i>Genius</i> idea, Layer, a true show of wisdom we sorely need... I am more confident than ever in my theory about the nature of the Blight.  But to test it, I absolutely <i>must</i> be allowed to travel in the next expedition.  And so... I was hoping that if I showed up armed to the eartips, like the Lummox always does, then maybe she'll realize how serious I am, how seriously she <i>should</i> have taken me in the first place!   ...And, of course, I could think of no one else whose skill I would trust to set me right with armaments that would actually suit me... So I don't go making a further fool of myself."</p>
    
    <p>...huh.  That's interesting.  Not his plan to impress the Esteemed, you don't really know if that will work.  You're interested in what he said about the Temple Gardens.  </p>
    
    <p id="Slabal">"What did you mean about the Gardens being wise?  The gardens still caught the Blight.  They helped, but they're only a temporary measure."</p>
    
    <p id="First">"But every little bit helps right now! Those gardens are very likely the only thing that's going to keep us fed long enough to implement an actual solution!  And although they caught the Blight, it's the <i>way</i> they caught the Blight that caught my attention!"</p>
    
    <p>He reaches into the satchel at his side, and pulls forth a long sheet of vellum.  There are diagrams on it, which seem to indicate various potential vectors for the Blight.  At least, you think that's what those arrows mean.  They are coming from and going into the Cliff Rye drawings, so you're not sure what else it could mean.</p>
    
    <p id="First">"See, here's where it all started to make sense.  The Blight is unlike any other crop disease we've encountered.  It's so baffling that we actually started chasing our tails thinking it was some kind of curse! Normally, when something like this happens, the Elpahka and the Bakshish can work together to eliminate it by curing all the diseased plants.  That didn't work on the Blight.  So, instead, we just destroyed the infected plants when we found them.  Bizarrely, that didn't work either! Even with no trace of it left, the Blight would return.   We bandied all sorts of ideas... maybe it's being blown in from somewhere else, or maybe it's really hard to see it early on and lots of infected plants are left in the fields, or maybe even it's being carried by <i>disease spirits</i>, I do not jest, someone suggested this with all sobriety.   But your Gardens, separated as they were, provided the telling evidence!</p>
    <p id="First">Separated out into numerous planters, these crops were close to each other, but didn't share the same soil and water as the other plants around them.  Then, when the blight struck them, rather than it wiping out all the crops in an area, it would just infect the crops <i>in that planter</i>. That made it obvious! <i>The Blight is in the soil!</i>  "</p>
    
    <p>You look at him coldly.  You don't mean anything by it, that's just how you look at people when you aren't paying attention.  And you certainly aren't right now.  You're not entirely sure about his logic, but some parts do ring true; after all, the soil placed in the planters and gardens came from the fertile plateaus, so it could have been carried that way.  You aren't sure about his assertion that only one planter would catch it at a time... however, you weren't really paying attention to that at the time.  After all, that was the Samra's job.  </p>
    <p>However, looking at his illustration of how the disease could travel... perhaps by air, perhaps by water, perhaps by soil... you're starting to get an idea.</p>
    
    <p id="First">"...nd thus the only possible solution to the Blight is simply to <i>escape</i> it, starting up agriculture in another fertile valley, and evidently identifying one cannot be left to someone with the men<i>tal capacity of a-</i>"</p>
    
    <p id="Slabal">"The ways the Blight can travel.  They all seem to be natural ways.  You are certain that it is not magical?"</p>
    
    <p>He's nonplussed again.  You try to make a note of it, he probably doesn't enjoy having that happen.  It's odd; you've seen him talk over any number of Bakshish trying to get a word in edgewise.  Why is he surprised when you interrupt him?</p>
    
    <p id="First">"...The other Bakshish just spent months investigating that possibility.  While that by no means is a <i>guarantee</i>, I'd say that it makes the chance remote.  Hopefully, if they listen to me this time, they'll put their heads to more productive investigations."</p>
    
    <p>You nod.  The idea has taken root.  If the Blight must travel by natural means, then would it be possible to protect the crops by sheltering them from the elements, as you would shelter people from hail or driving sleet?  Of course, even you can immediately see the issue with that.  They would still need water, soil, and light to grow.  Water could be handled easily... rainwater and mountain dew could merely be transported directly, as one does in the driest times.  Soil is a bit trickier, but if it travels in soil as he says, then soil that was proven to grow crops without death should be sufficient.  Light, however... would torches work? Candles?  Probably not.  And the fire hazard would be immense, in any regard.</p>
    
    <p>The First coughs loudly.  Right.  Prioritize.</p>
    <p>...His plan has merit.  The Blight is here.  So, go to where the Blight is not.  He is also likely correct that the Esteemed does not respect him.  She calls him young, a child.  Granted, he is young, and is childish.  </p>
    
    <p>But children can be wise also.</p>
    
    <p id="Slabal">"I see.  I can help you.  If you intend to travel as the Aggro do, you will need equipment to protect you.  Remove your robes.  I will need to see your shape."</p>
    
    <p>He hesitates, but then does as you ask.  You don't blame his hesitation.  It is the cold months.  </p>
    <p>...Hrm.  This will be a challenge.  His robes mask it well, but his frame is small, smaller than you even suspected.  However, he isn't scrawny; his musculature isn't defined, like some, but it is apparent.  Wiry.  That can be an advantage.  However, his short stature and small frame means that typical stone would be inappropriate.  You may be able to repurpose some sparring gear, embroider it, make it appear to be fit for war.</p>
    <p>You grab his hand, twisting it around, observing how his fingers move, his thumb bends, his arm flexes.  His digits are stained with red.  His wrist, supple, flexible.  His elbows are oddly calloused.  Yes, a thrusting weapon would be best.  You can modify a kuthe, give it some simple ornamentation. He will also need a hunter's bow.  Perhaps one of the ones you made after you realized your mistake.  You wish you had realized it sooner.</p>
    <p>He's shivering, now.  His skin has turned to gooseflesh.  He's becoming flushed.  Odd.  You didn't think it that cold in your workshop.  He may also need some extra down or wool to help.  Some additional measurements might help, but there is no sense in prolonging his suffering.  You should be able to make a start of it.</p
    >
    <p id="Slabal">"That is sufficient.  I believe I can make equipment that will make your intentions clear to the Esteemed.  I will have them ready for fitting tomorrow afternoon.  Return then and it will just be a matter of final adjustments.  You can go now."</p>
    <p>...</p>
    
    <p id="Slabal">"You will want to take your robes with you."</p>
    
    <p>Odd, that.  You thought he was cold.  You don't understand how he could forget them.  Perhaps he was thinking on other things. You know you're prone to that.  The physical world can seem such an inconvenience when there are other things to consider.  One task at a time.  You have a kuthe on hand in your shop, but for the armor, you will need to go to the warehouse, get some additional leather panelling, sinew, and wool.  You have other tasks, but none seem as pressing as this.  The promise of a solution to the Blight seems of the utmost importance.</p>
    <p>You leave your workshop, entering the brisk, crisp air.  The perfectly fitted stones feel cold beneath your feet.  You enjoy that sensation.  You're not sure why.  Your breath puffs in the air, and you can already feel your sinuses drying.  You enjoy that sensation less.  Around you, you can hear the wind whistling, but unfortunately, what you can also hear are unwelcome sounds.   Hacking.  A Samra carrying a basket of linens coughs wetly into their hand.  Another sweeping filth snorts, and expectorates.  You can remember a time when illnesses like these were cause for immediate attention, as no Crag should bear such infirmity without concern.  Now, starving, few in number, such sickness is common, opportunities to convalesce rare.  A susurration of sickness echoes through Echelon.  You enjoy that sensation least.</p>
    
    <p>As you often do when you encounter unpleasant sensations, you turn your attention to the surrounding architecture.  The legacy of your ancestors always serves to remind you that setbacks such as these are temporary.  In all the time that the Crag have existed, your ancestors must have faced these same trials, or worse, and yet you are still here, proof of your people's capacity for endurance.  The strong, stone walls of the Maker's District, flagstones woven together through masterful application of will.  The pavingstones you travel, slotted so closely together that no mortar could hope to improve them.  The rivulets, designed to funnel the dew and those rains which reach high enough into the reservoirs of the lower slopes, worn smooth by the water they channel.  The lanternposts, shining day and night, their enchanted flame dancing behind perfectly pure quartz mantles, as strong as it was since the day it was created.   In the distance, the walls which...</p>
    
    <p>You stop in your tracks.</p>
    <p>You look back at the lantern next to you.  At the pure, pristine flame, illuminating all around it from within it's protective shell of quartz.  Unlike true fire, it requires no air to breathe, and so the ancestors, in their wisdom, encased it fully in pure, untainted quartz, shaped into beautiful designs by the will of Onagi long passed.</p>
    <p>Pure, untainted, completely transparent quartz.</p>
    <p>Water to drink.  Soil to rest in.  Light to grow.</p>
    <p>...You must complete the First's raiment quickly.  There is other work to pursue.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You feel stiff. Without question, part of that is because you have maintained your current seated pose for hours now.  However, the stiffness is far better than the pain you would experience if you moved.  That seems to always be the way of things.  There is no option to fully alleviate suffering.  There are only the choices which may choose a lesser suffering over a greater.</p>
    
    <p>Your eyes open, revealing the cloudy nightscape of Eschaton.  Whether it is cloudy in truth or merely your damned eyes again is difficult to discern.  You should see to those, allow yourself to uncloud them, but... you can't help but shake the feeling that you deserve this.  After all, what has been the cause of so many ills lately but your clouded, shortsighted judgement?  Your repeated farce of leadership?  The others look to you for wisdom, but for every triumph, you bring equal or greater disaster.  Thus, is it not just that your sight should become as occluded as your foresight?  Is it not a sign of the gods' will that no matter how many times you clear your sight, it becomes shaded once more?  Perhaps if you let them fail, let yourself slip into true infirmity, another would come to take your place...</p>
    <p><i>Enough</i>. </p>
    
    <p>These are no times for such melodrama.  You should know better.  To presume to know the will of the gods is not only the truest vanity, it is also the truest folly.  No, this is not divine punishment.  It is merely yet another toll that must be paid for a life so long lived, another trial you must overcome.  Perhaps, for that reason, it is better to have passed soone-</p>
    <p><i><b>Enough</i></b>.</p>
    
    <p>The movement pains you, but you flex your arm, contort your digits.  Your dry lips crack open, a low, familiar chant issuing forth.  You place your palm against the bridge of your nose.  The time for wallowing in self pity is over.</p>
    
    <p>Your eyes burn.  It is one of a million pains you have endured.  Gods willing, it will be one of a million more you have yet to endure.  </p>
    
    <p>You are the <b>Esteemed Elpahka</b>! You are the Heart of the Crag people! You are the Wisdom of <i>The Tome</i>!<br>So many of your people are gone, <i>The Tome</i> is destroyed, but <i>you are still here.</i></p>
    <p>And as much as you can, as long as you can, you will remain for your people till they flourish once more, or the gods decide your time, and not a single moment less!</p>
    
    <p>You blink, and the nightscape of Eschaton comes into focus for the first time in weeks.</p>
    
    <p>...oh.  It actually was cloudy.  </p>
    
    <p>You tremble, slightly, more from pain than from exhaustion.  Your Ox gazes at you, awoken by your sudden movement.  You pat her head fondly, and she returns to her rest, closing her lovely brown eyes.  You follow suit; while clear of occlusion, your eyes still throbbed, and would likely do so for hours.  Another toll paid in pain.  To distract yourself, you instead focus on the sounds surrounding you.  The low wind, calm for the first time today.  The calm footsteps on the flagstones below, as your people returned to their homes to take their sadly meager repast and wait out the night.  The soft chime of-</p>
    
    <p>The sudden slap of leather sole against the stairs leading up to your pagoda.  Curious.  You had not summoned anyone.</p>
    <p>Creaking leather.  It is fresh, newly lacquered, not yet worn in.  A new suit, then.</p><p>A <i>klak</i> with each step.  The sound of something smacking lightly against a clasp.  The soft rattle. A scabbard.  It bounces against the armor, evidence of the wearer's inexperience in bearing it.</p>
    <p>Soft tread. Light build.  Even with evidence of wargear, the wearer is small.  It could be a young Aggro, newly trained, or...</p>
    <p id="First">"<small>-damn thing hold still-</small>"</p>
    <p>...Ah.  </p>
    <p>You grimace.  You know this is no time to wallow in self doubt, but it was difficult when confronted with certain truths.  The First had had the right of it, as you feared he had.  His work corralling the Bakshish to continue looking into the Blight yielded little, and Aggro bluntness had made his proposed expedition a poor endeavor.  And now he comes, before you summoned him.  You can practically taste his arrogance, and yet, arrogance does not always require folly.  </p>
    <p>It is time to correct your mistake-</p>
    <p>The footsteps reach a peak.  Trodding behind you.  He walks carefully, his step even and measured, avoiding unnecessary noise.  Your back is turned to him, and he approaches before your table.</p>
    <p>He opens his mouth.</p>
    <p id="Esteemed">"It is good of you to come, First.  In three days, Echo and his pathfinders will be setting forth for the Eastern Ranges, to look for evidence of the suitable fertile valleys that you anticipated.  You will travel with them, and take a handpicked team of three scribes to accompany.  You will also carry any supplies or equipment you require to test your theories while in the field.  When you return in five week's time, I expect that you will bring information to further enlighten us.  Before you leave, you should speak with Echo, so that he may show you the correct way to wear and wield your wargear.  It would be a great folly for you to risk yourself without sufficient preparation.  <i>You may go now.</i>"</p>
    
    <p>The air is still.  Your cracked lips and dry tongue ache.  You retain your pose, turned to face Eschaton.</p>
    <p>You hear the grinding of teeth.</p>
    <p>And with that, you know you have performed your part well.  </p>
    
    <p>The footsteps trod away, loud, petulant.  He has gotten his wish, but not how he imagined it.  He wanted to impress you, to awe you.  In truth, he has.  It is rare for a Bakshish to wish to endanger themselves so.  To go so far as to gear for war, to be prepared to bear the scorn of the Aggro in order to signal his willingness to face peril, is impressive.  If only the gesture had been born of careful wisdom instead of childish spite, it may not have been necessary to upstage him.  But if there is one lesson from your Ancestors, long written in <i>The Tome's</i> indices by the Elpahka of old, a lesson which still survives its destruction, it is this;</p>
    
    <p>Be mindful of the Bakshish, for they easily mistake knowledge for wisdom, facts for truths.  </p>
    <p>They are our memory, but we are their mind.  </p>
    <p><i>A mind ruled by its memory is mad.</i></p>
    
    <p>For now, you must remain firm.  In time, he will learn humility.  It is a natural thing for all Crag to learn, as the mistakes of their past grow too great to ignore.  In time, he will be as the Firsts of the past, an irreplaceable asset, a stalwart mind.  And as he gains your respect... hopefully, so too, will you gain his.</p>
    
    <p>A cold wind whips over the mountainside. It promises renewal.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p><b>Misc- </b>You had a visitor this turn. Things went pretty quietly, actually. The Esteemed Elpahka may have gotten some good information though.</p>
    <p><b>Economic- </b>The Layer's odd plan turns out to be a stroke of genius, not to mention for once your ancient texts turn out to be quite helpful. Quartz is something in no short supply, and the surviving texts have quite a bit of information in them on purifying quartz to be translucent as well as the construction of the everburning lanterns. Your stoneshapers are able to select quite clear grades of quartz and through careful crafting flatten and fuse them into panes that are as translucent as the highest quality glass.</p>
    <p>Constructing the glass houses turns out to be little more difficult than scaling up the design philosophy of the lanterns. Some tweaking is needed of course: reinforcing large sheets of quartz, angling the glass walls to let maximum light in, actually adding doors, and so on. In the end, it's a success! Eschaton has the aspect <i>Glass Ceilings.</i></p>
    
    <p>It's also a success in keeping small amounts of crops safe from the Blight. Indeed, thanks to some valuable information gleaned from your druids, <i>no crops placed in quartz gardens catch the blight!</i></p>
    
    <p>It's ultimately a small victory - it's still a small amount of crops, just barely enough to keep most of the strains alive - but it is a victory nonetheless!</p>
    
    <p><b>Political- </b>Though some might call it indecisiveness or laziness - and some do - it seems there is wisdom in knowing when inaction is preferable to action. The crag elves are a strong people, but they have their limits. Limits which are currently being tested to the brink. </p>
    
    <p>Allowing the guards and soldiers normally patrolling to take light duty indeed allows them to get some rest and much needed relaxation. Not to mention lowers the calories they need and reduces the hunger pangs. Keeping them off their feet for too long might make them restless, but for now it's actually helpful. </p>
    
    <p>Of course, light guard duty allows an odd stranger to actually walk right up to Eschaton... Funny how that happened at such a fortuitous time.</p>
    
    <p>That aside, the rest is good for Eschaton. You will receive a <b>boost die</b> on your next recovery check due to the wisdom of inaction.</p>
    
    <p><b>Military- </b>First, the good news. The Aggro and Bakshish pathfinders, for once in their damned lives, actually get it together and cooperate to use the best of their strengths. The memory of their previous embarrassing failures in the back of their minds, they attack the expedition with uncommon gusto. Indeed, their surveys are detailed and thorough and they complete the entire expedition accurately and ahead of schedule!</p>
    
    <p>Now, the bad news: If the First's theory about nearby fertile valleys is correct, there aren't any in the territories scouted. They find barren, craggy, harsh stone along an unforgiving mountainside. This is of course not to say they return empty handed. Far from it, they are able to gather a large amount of hunted or trapped game - mostly mountain goats and birds. It's not a massive amount of food, but every little bit help.</p>
    
    <p>Now, for the uh... <i>interesting</i> news.</p>
    <p>The square directly to the east of Escahton contains the <i>Foothills</i> and <i>Steep Cliffsides</i> aspects. Basic minerals like iron, quartz, and granite can be mined there if so desired. That's not the most interesting thing in the territory. High up in the northernmost section of the territory, the expedition discovers a concealed cave.</p>
    
    <p>In this cave, they find what was once a small dwelling. Strewn about it are the remnants of inhabitation - old kettles, the remains of an improvised hearth, some rotted food stores (typical,) a few bits of old bedrolls and camping gear and the like.</p>
    
    <p>Strewn about the cave are also the remnants of the inhabitants - specifically about 12 hobgoblins. Judging by the condition of the bodies, they died weeks or months ago at least. And boy, they sure did die quick. It seems there was a fight here. A very one-sided fight. The hobgoblins are so badly injured that it appears they were essentially dismembered, and the cuts are far too clean and deliberate to be an animal attack.</p>
    
    <p>The fact that their heads have all been severed and stacked in a neat pile is also a hint that this isn't the work of an animal. Each head, along with an expression of terror and agony, has a strange symbol burned into their faces. The symbols are all the same, and they are a runic form of the Lycan language. This runic form is very rare and quite different from normal written Skaplyndi.</p>
    <p>(If someone speaks Lycan, it's a DC 15 to translate. If not, it's DC 25)</p>
    <p><span class="redacted">The rune is actually two separate runes layered on top of eachother. </span></p>
    <p><span class="redacted">One rune is "hefja blót," a rune meaning essentially "to sacrifice a heathen in worship of Luna."</span></p>
    <p><span class="redacted">The other rune is "eyðask," meaning "come to naught, wasted, purged."</span></p>
    <p>Your expedition wisely nopes the fuck out of there.</p>
    
    <p>The northeastern square contains more barren rock, having the aspect <i>High Mountains. </i>Near the exact center of the square, they find a massive several mile wide crater. Most interestingly, they find that when they step into the crater rim their everburning lamps immediately extinguish. After a little panic and backing up, the lamps come back on. A little further examination reveals that the entire crater is a null magic zone.</p>
    <p>Further examination of the crater reveals scattered fist-sized dark green crystals of a type no one in the group has ever seen before. How exactly they or the crater got there is anyone's guess for now, but it seems that the crystals take a small amount of the crater's antimagic effects with them. Upon examining them, the First recognizes the crystals as an extremely rare type of stone the ancients described long ago as <i>Noqual.</i></p>
    <p>This square contains the Aspects <i>High Mountains, Antimagic crater,</i> and <i>Noqual Deposit.</i></p>
    <p>While none of this helps directly address the famine, the extra food brought on return is a small boon. The next <b>Recovery</b> check to mitigate the Blight's damage will get a <b>boost die.</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Mental- </b>The First's hunch to examine the soil as a vector turns out to be correct. Indeed, the Blight thrives and expands itself in warm damp soil. Critically, even small amounts of soil can propagate the Blight. Even the small amount a gardener carries under their fingernails and on their boots can spread the Blight, and even a small amount of contamination is fatal to a crop. Thankfully this is discovered early enough to save the quartz gardens.</p>
    <p>After this revelation, the more paranoid researchers go off on a hunch. It proves fortuitous, as they manage to learn something very interesting about the Blight: While for all intents and purposes it acts as a normal crop blight, it is somehow resistant to magic. Purify food and drink doesn't always work, and even food that has been magically purified can contain and spread the blight. There is little precedent for a blight with such a dire adaptation, and it only fuels theories about the blight's dark origins.</p>
    <p>Mercifully, the Blight can't exist long without a plant to devour. Even in soil, it can only last for a few weeks. Carried on a person or in water, a day or two at most.</p>
    <p>Thanks to all this new information, further attempts to kill the Blight will get a <b>bonus die.</b></p>
    <p><b>Event: The Blight</b></p>
    <p><b>Status: Ongoing</b></p>
    <p>The Blight is a thing without mercy or empathy. Though you have made great progress in fighting it, crops still die and bellies go empty. You take the normal stress damage from the blight this turn. Even the stony stoicism of the crag elves is starting to show cracks.</p>
    
    <p>The situation is even worse in reality than the public knows. Quietly, the First does his own personal calculations. Despite calculating the numbers dozens of times he comes to the same grim conclusion. The Blight could disappear immediately leaving all healthy crops untouched and Eschaton would still starve. Even if every single precious ancient heirloom grain is devoured, no matter what is done to extend supplies, simply too much damage has been done to Eschaton's food infrastructure to recover with what you have now. It's only a matter of time.</p>
    
    <p>Unless the crag elves find an external source of food (and soon), Eschaton is doomed in the long run.</p>
