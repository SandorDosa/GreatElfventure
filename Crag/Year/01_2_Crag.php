mountainside, and if, IF, this has finally done it and you&rsquo;ve finally contained the spread of this insidious disease, you&rsquo;re probably still going to go hungry this winter, and </span><span

It was the decision of the Esteemed, </span><span class="c14 c25">at my recommendation,</span><span class="c15 c14">&nbsp;that you should collect a force of Aggro whom are most skilled in scouting and natural lore, and go on an expedition to nearby terrains, both in the nearby ranges where our people once flourished, as well as in the Lowlands, where only you and yours have significant experience in treading. &nbsp;The reason for this expedition is twofold. &nbsp;First, and I will put this simply as possible, we must try to find new farmland for our crops. &nbsp;One of our theories is that the blight may be bound locationally, either in the soil, or to Eschaton itself. &nbsp;We can test this, and hopefully to our immediate benefit, by finding new outcroppings and plateaus with the ideal conditions for growing these crops. &nbsp;We may even be fortunate to find other native flora capable of growing in mountainous conditions, which we could begin to cultivate.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c15 c14"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c14">As for the Lowlands, well, that is a proposition which is both riskier, and may be more rewarding. &nbsp;You yourself attested to the fact that the Lowlands were often congested with vegetation, a true embarrassment of greenery. &nbsp;My hope is that by travelling there, you may be able to find readily available sources of food which we could exploit, even temporarily, to feed our people until this issue can be resolved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c15 c14"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">The buffoon nods, his sickening neck muscles bulging with each bob. </span><span class="c15 c22 c45">&ldquo;Sounds good! There were a lot of veggies and critters down there, some of them were even quite delicious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c15 c22 c45"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">You shudder internally. &nbsp;You still cannot believe that this oaf manages to put his tunic on the right way each morning, much less was capable of achieving such great deeds as to be </span><span class="c9 c13">Named</span><span class="c9">. &nbsp;That said, if you&rsquo;re being totally honest with yourself(something that has an annoying tendency to crop up when you&rsquo;re otherwise enjoying your focusing tonics), there must be more to him than the obvious, well, </span><span class="c9 c13">nothing</span><span class="c0">, given the Esteemed&rsquo;s faith in his abilities. &nbsp;Look at her, so insufferably calm in the face of this calamity. &nbsp;What does she know that you don&rsquo;t? &nbsp;What wisdom is she graced with that eludes you? &nbsp;How can she possibly know that Echo is the appropriate choice for this?</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">You are the </span><span class="c22 c24">Esteemed</span><span class="c9">, and you fervently hope that by the grace of all the Ancestors, you are making the appropriate choice. &nbsp;The dreadful calculus behind it is simple; Of all of the bloodlines who still survive in Eschaton, the Aggro contribute the least in times of peace; putting them to work elsewhere kills two crows with a single stone, displacing their nutritional needs to forage on the road, and putting them to what is hopefully good use. &nbsp;You do not know if The First truly understands the difficulty of his suggested course of action; &nbsp;Even with </span><span class="c9 c13">The Tome</span><span class="c0">, your people&rsquo;s knowledge of Lowland herbology and hunting was sorely limited. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">...Lowland hunting. &nbsp;Hrm.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">The precepts set within </span><span class="c9 c13">The Tome</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;levied strict restrictions on the practice of hunting in the communes; recognition of the fragile nature of fauna at this level, and how easily this natural resource could be depleted. &nbsp;But if what The First says is true&hellip; if the long isolation of your people is truly over&hellip; then is it not time to also reconsider other old wisdoms? &nbsp;The game, foul, and even fish that reside in the climes around Eschaton would make for a considerable supplemental source of food; not a permanent solution, no, but perhaps enough to stave off disaster.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Very well. &nbsp;You have decided it. &nbsp;Thus, it will be so. &nbsp;You interrupt whatever parley is occurring without a second thought. &nbsp;It cannot be as important as this decision.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12">&ldquo;Thank you, First Scholar. &nbsp;Echo, you now know what it is you must do. &nbsp;Gather your most keeneyed scouts, your most nimble trailblazers. &nbsp;You will go forth from Eschaton, and find a solution to our ills.<br>You may go. &nbsp;Return when you have achieved your task.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The enormous Aggro rises from his resting place, then rises some more. &nbsp;It always shocks you to see how enormous he is. &nbsp;Even for a people dedicated to the path of Physical Perfection, he is a paragon, a small taste of what you and all your forebears have strived to create. &nbsp;He leaves your table, the solid stone quaking beneath his footsteps.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And now, for the other one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12">And as for you, First.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">You level your gaze at him. &nbsp;He seems unusually composed. &nbsp;Perhaps he is finally learning to master himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c34">&ldquo;You may go as well. &nbsp;You will continue your studies into the nature of this Blight. &nbsp;Before you do so, however, locate The Layer. &nbsp;Tell her I wish to give her an assignment as well. &nbsp;I will see her at her earliest convenience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No, perhaps not. &nbsp;There is the petulant curl to his lips. &nbsp;It is unfortunate that one so clever must also be so young. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c14">&ldquo;Of course, Esteemed. &nbsp;As you wish. &nbsp;I wish you good health and fortune on the enormous volume of tasks plaguing you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He rises from his spot as well, his soft feet barely making a sound on the floor. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Your brew has gone cold. &nbsp;Excellent. &nbsp;You prefer it that way.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">The sun dips low, receding into the horizon. &nbsp;The clouds parted enough for you to watch it descend. &nbsp;Soon, the only light in Eschaton will be by the ancient lanterns, long ago lit by powerful magics, still guttering heatless flame to this day. &nbsp;That art, at least, has not been lost to you. </span><span class="c9 c13">Yet</span><span class="c0">, you think.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The flagstones leading up to the Esteemed&rsquo;s pagoda flow beneath your feet. &nbsp;With every step, you can feel their strength. &nbsp;They were among the first things repaired when Eschaton was reclaimed. &nbsp;Every Crag knows the importance of a well kept path.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">You are </span><span class="c22 c24">Slabal Nanockova</span><span class="c9">, simple craftself, architect, and, evidently, </span><span class="c9 c13">The Layer of The Path</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;You still don&rsquo;t really understand why. &nbsp;Not that you question your work, obviously. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve proven to yourself many times now that you can confidently state that your work is of pretty adequate quality. &nbsp;Of course, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement. &nbsp;But it does it&rsquo;s job well, others seem to be happy with it. &nbsp;No, it&rsquo;s more that being named such apparently comes with a lot of extra baggage that you really haven&rsquo;t quite gotten a handle on yet. &nbsp; Like all the management. &nbsp; The other Onagi coming to you for orders. &nbsp;Or asking you to verify their work. &nbsp;Or wanting you to &ldquo;sign off&rdquo; on things. &nbsp;Or the delegation. &nbsp;You can confidently state that you have no idea how to delegate. &nbsp;If something needs to be done, you&rsquo;d prefer to do it.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Oh well. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s another skill to master. &nbsp;It might be harder than the other skills, but you have plenty of time to work on it. &nbsp;Good things come to those who tread the path.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The steps up to the Esteemed&rsquo;s pagoda are a far cry from the paths you walked upon. &nbsp;The stone is sensitive. &nbsp;Groaning. &nbsp;Every time you come here, you have to resist the urge to begin working on it. &nbsp;That happened the first time. &nbsp;She told you later that it wasn&rsquo;t as important as other things. &nbsp;She was correct, of course. &nbsp;She is the Esteemed. You get the feeling that she was embarrassed for you. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t necessary, but you can appreciate the gesture, on a logical level.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ah, speaking of. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s still on that Ox of hers. &nbsp;Her eyes are closed. &nbsp;If she were a crageese, or a rockhawk, you&rsquo;d think her asleep. She isn&rsquo;t. You still think it would be a little safer if you could give her some kind of saddle to use. &nbsp;She refuses. &nbsp;Oh well. &nbsp;She is the Esteemed. &nbsp;But after all your talks, it has become easier to think of her as Ledret. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re glad for that. &nbsp;It seems to make her happy when you call her by her birth name. &nbsp;You get the feeling that sometimes she feels lonely. &nbsp;You can understand that.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c17">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, Ledret. &nbsp;I know I have made you wait. &nbsp;I hope you don&rsquo;t feel annoyed by that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c15 c17"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">It&rsquo;s true. &nbsp;Everything you&rsquo;ve ever said is true. &nbsp;You understand why others don&rsquo;t, sometimes.

You wonder for a moment if she wants you to speak now. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not sure what to say, however. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t really understand much about &lsquo;the gods&rsquo;, per se. &nbsp;She seems to like to blame them when things go awry. &nbsp;She seems to imply they are challenging her, testing your people with trials and woes. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t really agree with that. &nbsp;The cause of your people&rsquo;s woes seems pretty obvious to you. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c22 c24 c29">Animals. </span><span class="c9">Maybe you should point that out. &nbsp;Before you can, however, she speaks again.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12">&ldquo;The First has made it clear. &nbsp;If we try to recover using only what was left to us by our ancestors, we are doomed. &nbsp;We may be doomed, regardless, for his path to recovery requires us to break with tradition. &nbsp; We must travel forth from the mountains. &nbsp;We must further expose ourselves to The World, in search of a solution to this Blight, and to other shortfalls. &nbsp;I have conceded to this. &nbsp;However, a thought struck me. &nbsp;One which may help ease our people&rsquo;s suffering. &nbsp;For untold generations, we have carefully monitored our consumption of fowl and game found in the wilds around our home. &nbsp;It was as our Ancestors decreed, to ensure that this vital supplement would not be lost to misuse. &nbsp;But if we are to find succor further from home anyway, then may we not exploit this careful preservation to alleviate the hunger that stalks Eschaton?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">You nod your head. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re familiar with that hunger. &nbsp;To be honest, you knew of it before The Blight struck. &nbsp;You have a tendency to get&hellip; focused. &nbsp;Sometimes you forget basic things. &nbsp;You understand if others find it more concerning. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12">&ldquo;Therefore, I have a task for you and the Onagi. &nbsp;I trust you to pass my orders to them. &nbsp;We need more hunting tools.

Just&hellip; maybe not in the most productive way this time. They attack their assignment of acquiring hunting implements with great gusto, and throw themselves into the task. However, they end up doing what they always do. They read the texts they have always read, and do what they always done. You end up with only a few spears, slings, and fishooks but a great deal of bows. In fact, the same bows you </span><span class="c18 c13">always</span><span class="c15 c18">&nbsp;get. Big, heavy, powerful warbows.

At first, there is a great outcry at turning some of the larger pavilions and amphitheaters into gardens, but the rumbling of empty bellies quickly drowns them out. It&rsquo;s a difficult job, and even more difficult to keep the blight out. In a stroke of either genius or luck, the distributed nature of the victory gardens actually provides some resistance against the blight. If a crop catches the blight, it only immediately spreads to a small portion of the produce.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c18">The victory gardens won&rsquo;t be enough to feed your people long term, but they do work. The food they produce is enough to keep many off the ragged edge of starvation, and indeed preserve some of the rare ancestral grains from the blight. It has bought you time, if nothing else. You have enough supplies to last the winter at least, and the will of the crag elves should last through the season as well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c18 c13">You have successfully moved 2 points of stress to the property track, however the event is still ongoing and your economy and morale tracks are still taking stress.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c15 c18"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Military- </span><span class="c18">Leading the crag elves is turning out to be quite frustrating.

It would almost feel better if they detected the touch of some foul magic, or the presence of some interloping outsider. At least that would mean there&rsquo;s a purpose to it. Alas, nothing - one way or another. Still, the sheer act of spending time in mediation and carefully considering the nature of the blight was not wasted time. Your wisest elves have spent weeks doing nothing but consider the nature of the blight itself, and perhaps how they can withstand it. Your next mental action, whatever it is, will receive a </span><span class="c7">bonus die</span><span class="c15 c18">.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c15 c18"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Event: The Blight</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Status: Ongoing</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c15 c18"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c18">It has been a frustrating season for the crag elves. Crops continue to fail. Food stores continue to get lower. The crag elves, however, are not an easily defeated people. They withstand, for now. Their bodies are strong, their dedication to their ways is resolute. At the very least, the victory garden project is a success and has staved off the bitter end just a little while longer. The blight itself, however, continues to not care...</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c15 c18"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c18">You continue to suffer the effects of the blight, and take one stress to both economy and morale.</span></p>
