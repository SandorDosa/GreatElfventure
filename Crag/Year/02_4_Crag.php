</div><h2 class="c30 c16" id="h.jqvhuf4kg4e9"><span class="c50">Spring, Year 2</span></h2><p class="c18 c16"><span class="c32 c19">ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">A chill wind drifts under your doorframe. &nbsp;Thankfully, it is not the icy, stabbing tendrils that had been assaulting Eschaton for months; finally, it seems that the dreadful winter has relented, and once more the chill has returned to levels that do not distract unduly from your tasks. &nbsp;This is fortunate, as the task before you does require the utmost concentration. &nbsp;It is unfortunate that the wind is not the only source of distraction present.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;...and these wings actually allowed them to fly? &nbsp;I can understand if they were merely cultivated for some cultural or aesthetic reason, but what possible pressures would have allowed them to develop full scale flight? &nbsp;Are you certain that they could?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">The intricate pattern, etched upon fresh vellum, provides an apt focus. &nbsp;Under ideal circumstances, you would not truly require it; &nbsp;after all, the bas relief which you now seek to reproduce can be seen clearly in your mind&rsquo;s eye, as surely as if it still stood before you. &nbsp;Even further, the looping whorls, the elegant crosshatch, the deeper furrows all join together to describe an event that all Crag know by heart. &nbsp;Even if you had never seen this relief, you would have known all that would be necessary to do it justice in stone.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">To tell of The Exodus of the First Generation.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;I cannot say to have extensively witnessed them performing the act. &nbsp;However, it was quite clear from context and from behavior that they are capable of literal flight. &nbsp;I cannot be certain if this is entirely due to their wings, or if some innate magic propels them. &nbsp;But yes. &nbsp;I can confidently state that they could fly.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">The image in your mind is so clear, so flawless, that you feel fairly certain that you could will it into the slab. &nbsp;Of course, that would be a tremendous waste of will; attempting to emulate such fine features is taxing, and even those who are certain in their abilities may find flaws introduced by the slightest lapse in concentration. &nbsp;Hence, the stone pen. &nbsp; Its tip shines dully in the light which filters through your window. &nbsp;With practiced hand, it glides over the stone, delicate repeated motions causing lines, troughs, furrows to sink into its flawlessly smooth face.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;Well, in that case, it must be some form of innate magic. &nbsp; The wingspan as you describe it seems far from adequate to be able to lift a full sized elf, even a stunty lowlander! &nbsp;Unless&hellip; unless their physiology was </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;radically changed that it impacted even bone density, like a gooses&rsquo;! &nbsp;How much did they weigh? &nbsp;Was their gear light?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6">The pen is an extension of yourself. &nbsp;It is a calming experience. &nbsp;A connecting one. &nbsp;Its presence, your actions, connect you with your bloodline, through countless generations of Onagi. &nbsp;Although the stem and grip has been replaced several times, once even by yourself, the diamond tip was willed centuries ago; it has endured those untold ages with minimal will necessary to hone its shape. &nbsp; The last to do so was the one who gifted the tool to you, Thorgi Nanockich. &nbsp;The very same day he saw you as worthy to bear this pen, he also saw you worthy to bear the Name he had borne. &nbsp;That day, you became </span><span class="c15 c38">Slabal Nanockova.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; Perhaps, in due time, you will do the same for whomever you find worthy. Whomever you may teach, may inspire, to have the capacity of carrying on that Inspired Bloodname. &nbsp;You should probably devote some more time to that. &nbsp;One more project for the pile.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;I can provide little insight into that fact. &nbsp;I did not find circumstance to lift one of their number bodily, nor to enquire specifically about their weight. &nbsp;At best, I can note that their garb did not seem abundantly encumbering.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Gentle curves follow sharp angles. &nbsp;The sight of Elfkind in disarray. &nbsp;The chaos. &nbsp;The waste. &nbsp;The foolishness. &nbsp;Over it all, keen eyes, sorrowful eyes, bear witness to calamity. &nbsp;It is a solemn truth they face. &nbsp;The fact that without great sacrifice, the barbarism they see will consume all of their kind.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;...Ah. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Of course. &nbsp;While that would have been valuable information to gather, it might have seemed&hellip; impolitic. &nbsp;Very well, a different subject. &nbsp;You had mentioned that the subtype of the&hellip; Fire, it was&hellip; obscured their features with masks. &nbsp;But apparently, not all of them; &nbsp;The Ashwalker, in particular, made no attempt to conceal her face. &nbsp;Was it perhaps some deformity? &nbsp;Did you happen to notice them taking the masks off at any point? &nbsp;Did it sound like their mouths or nasal passages were malformed?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">The flowing lines tell the story, the unfortunate truth which the First Generation realized; That the only possible salvation from such barbarism, such degradation, was to flee it entirely; &nbsp;to accept the great hardship that came with such isolation in such an unforgiving place, knowing that the alternative would be a descent into animalistic chaos. &nbsp;To bear the burden of having abandoned so many kin, knowing that for every soul they saved from that fate, countless others would be forced to endure it.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;I do not think so, at least as far as any audible indication of malformation. &nbsp;It is possible that they were disfigured otherwise, but it would be pure conjecture. &nbsp;It may be as simple as an affectation. &nbsp;Though I cannot speak conclusively, it did seem that those who were masked were those who spoke with greatest authority.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6">Great crosshatches create dark shadows, the cruel fate of those left in the lowlands, as the First Generation ascended towards streaks of radiant enlightenment. &nbsp;In the heights, the mountaintops, they can see clearly for the first time. &nbsp;What they spy is something other than fear or sorrow; it is hope. &nbsp;Great geometric shapes show the future they can envision, the Path that they must follow; to better themselves, to become true and pure, to not merely ascend the mountains, but to ascend </span><span class="c6 c10">themselves</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;It is a long path, an arduous one, fraught with sacrifice, danger, and trials, but the Final Destination it promises provides an answer to the suffering, not just theirs, but of all Elvenkind.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oho! &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s a totemic thing! &nbsp;Their Named, or whatever their equivalent is, must enshroud themselves in ritualistic masks in order to show that they are not just themselves, but have become some great virtue of their kind! &nbsp;The masks did appear to be different in design, yes?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Branches upon branches upon branches tell of the Path laid by the First Generation, of the solemn duty that they bore, of the Destination they pursued; &nbsp;a Path that would always be lined with pain and sacrifice, and yet which would strengthen them, empower them, leave them stronger for every step taken towards that final goal. &nbsp;These brave souls knew that hardship and pain would be their lot, the lot of their descendents, the lot of their descendents a dozen times removed, and yet that hardship would be the fuel to harden those who would come after, to mould them, to remove their impurities. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;That is correct. &nbsp;The two masks I witnessed did bear different designs. &nbsp;They were also cast out of subtly different alloys of bronze.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6">Reliefs of this nature are&hellip; were&hellip; </span><span class="c6 c10">will be</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;a common motif found throughout the temples and halls of Eschaton, and the vast majority of them are largely the same up to this point; from here, the individual depictions will allow themselves opportunity to represent the great actions and achievements of the bloodlines, showing their skill in labor, their art in war. &nbsp;In particular, the relief you are working from pays homage to the dutiful laborers of the Samra, depicting as their distant ancestors&rsquo; bountiful hands drew forth life from the cruel rock, the uncaring mountainside, how untold generations of careful cultivation and patient horticulture created the vast sweeps of fertile fields and the great array of hardy crops which fed&hellip; </span><span class="c6 c10">feed</span><span class="c1">&hellip; the Crag people to this day. &nbsp;This depiction seemed an appropriate one, considering the structure it is intended for.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s only fitting with the other materialistic displays you noted from various other Lowlanders. &nbsp;It is likely that Bronze is as precious a metal to these Fires as iron is to the Swords. &nbsp;Did you happen to recognize a similar materialistic desire from any of the other subtypes? &nbsp;Any particular mineral that these Rivers worship, perhaps? &nbsp;Or were they perhaps obsessed with any other possession?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">As part of this recognition of their contributions to all, one of their number is depicted in immaculate detail. &nbsp;Her features clearly resemble those of a modern Crag, and her expression is one of stoic certainty; she is the very model of the dutiful Samra. &nbsp;Who she is in particular&hellip; you have no idea. &nbsp;Perhaps, now, no one does. &nbsp;But her specific identity is not important. &nbsp;What is important is her place within the history of your people, yet one more example of the progress that has been made, of the responsibilities that have been upheld, of the hardships overcome. &nbsp;She is not just a symbol, or an abstract rendering; she was a real, living, breathing Crag, who worked and strived to help her people become what they are today. &nbsp;She was one of many, and yet, no less vital than any other to seek the future that all Crag aspire to.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c29">&ldquo;There was a call for silver, but I do not think that points to a particular obsession, more a pragmatic desire. &nbsp;Otherwise&hellip; &nbsp;I can say one thing that was of note is that the Rivers seemed obsessed with amassing painful foods. &nbsp;Indeed, they seemed to take great joy in ingesting them, and of inflicting them upon others, then bearing witness to their reactions.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6">And, of course, following the depictions of venerated histories comes the part that is simultaneously the simplest, and yet, most poignant part of the relief. &nbsp;A great, blank expanse of relief, depicting nothing but a gently curving line. &nbsp; The symbol is a simple, but powerful reminder; for all that has been achieved, the Path has not yet been fully Trod. &nbsp; The duty is not done, sacrifice and strife is still required. &nbsp;As attested by countless other depictions of other real, living ancestors that now fill sheafs and sheafs of vellum stacked reverently in your workshop, the improvement of self from the times of the First Generation to today have been steady and consistent. &nbsp;No one truly knows, especially with the loss of </span><span class="c6 c10">The Tome</span><span class="c6">, when exactly your ancestors began calling themselves Crag. &nbsp;It is entirely possible that they were some other variety of elf before; indeed, it may be that, in generations fore, the Crag will be no more, replaced by some other, greater form of elf. &nbsp;And yet, the Crag will live on, in these depictions and reliefs, just one more step taken upon the road to </span><span class="c6 c10">perfection</span><span class="c1">.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh, I can only imagine, given what provisions we had from the Lowlands. &nbsp;At the very least, when the Esteemed threw open the doors to the warehouses, she made sure that the rest of that muck was consumed first. &nbsp;Far better to have partial rations of actually tolerable food than partial rations of some indigestible dross, yes? &nbsp;Anyway, I&rsquo;d like to switch track here&hellip; did you happen to observe any&hellip; er&hellip; reproductive rituals of Lowlanders while you were there? &nbsp;Any mating displays, or dominance contests, or political pairings?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Your hand halts in its task. &nbsp;The filigree which you had been marking rests, half completed.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">There is a prolonged silence. &nbsp;With all due care for the venerable tool, you put down your stone pen.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;First, at this point I feel compelled to ask what the purpose of all these questions is. &nbsp;I cannot help but think that some context may help to better guide my answers, which may overall result in a more efficient conversation. &nbsp;As it seems that every answer I give only brings more and increasingly esoteric questions, I am concerned that I may not be providing the answers you desire due to this lack of context.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">You look over at the First. &nbsp;Curiously, he has an unusual expression on his face. &nbsp;His skin seems somewhat flushed. &nbsp;His lips are drawn into a thin line. &nbsp;It is clear that he is uncomfortable. &nbsp;You are unsure if he is uncomfortable due to the chilled room, or perhaps some part of your conversation. &nbsp;With him, you&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s best to not assume anything. &nbsp;He generally manages to explain himself. &nbsp;Often with far more detail than was necessary, desired, or possible to retain.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Finally, after several silent moments of fidgeting with his pen and notes, he finally closes his eyes, lets out a long, weary sigh, and responds.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to collate what information I can about Lowlander behaviors, cultures, and&hellip; specifically&hellip; traits.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">He pauses again. &nbsp;That response was unusually succinct. &nbsp;Fortunately, you&rsquo;ve found that if you remain silent, eventually he will continue elaborating to fill the silence. &nbsp;This allows you to fine tune to the level of information you need.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;... I&rsquo;ve discovered something. &nbsp;Or, at least, possibly have. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s still a great amount of conjecture I must resort to, as my records are so </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">damnably</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;incomplete! &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m concerned that if what my conjectures point to are true, then it will be critical for us to understand the natures and cultures of the Lowlanders, and what&hellip; physiology they have. &ldquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s still a bit cryptic. &nbsp;You remain silent, but continue looking directly at him to show that you are paying attention. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want him to think you&rsquo;re ignoring him. &nbsp;That would be impolite.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;...And, while your reports have been&hellip; somewhat adequate&hellip; I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re still not quite detailed enough for me to have a proper collation of Lowlander traits. &nbsp;As such, I wanted to try to gather as many details as I could so that I could seem informed about Lowlander cultural interaction when I make my proposal to the Esteemed.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Ah. &nbsp;That does explain some things. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s wanting to sway the Esteemed again, and he wants to ensure she takes his suggestion seriously. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a fair concern; she does seem to consider his words with a fair deal of skepticism. &nbsp;However, given his recent tendency to just act on his whims, you wonder what he could be considering that he would even bother trying to sway her. &nbsp;You feel it&rsquo;s best to address that curiosity directly.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;What proposal would that be?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Again, he fidgets and hesitates. &nbsp;It is always so odd to you that he gets like this. &nbsp;It seems like it only happens in your workshop. &nbsp;You wonder what could be in here that seems to distract him so. &nbsp;Perhaps it&rsquo;s the mess? &nbsp;You do try to keep things organized, but you can see how your organization would seem&hellip; non-intuitive to some.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;...Layer, I have the utmost confidence in your abilities as a Craftself. &nbsp;It is abundantly clear to anyone with one eye and a quarter of their wits, and still fairly clear to anyone who cannot meet such requirements, that you are a peerless genius, with an unsurpassed mastery of more fields than most Crag are even aware exists, and I would never, ever question your capabilities in such regards. &nbsp;But when it comes to recording details, obtaining the truth, and discerning which of these are </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">vital</span><span class="c4">, and which are merely interesting, there are none who excel at such tasks quite like my bloodline.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">And so, while I mean no insult to you in your proven capacity so far, I intend to convince the Esteemed to send me in your place for the upcoming Lowlander &lsquo;Potlu-&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;I will assist you however you require.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo; &lsquo;-ck&rsquo;... uh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Oh dang. &nbsp;You kind of jumped on that one. &nbsp;Odd, usually you&rsquo;re less impulsive than that. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">After all, thinking about it, his proposal is likely a terrible one. &nbsp;While you have no doubt that the First would be capable of some impressively detailed notes on the proceedings&hellip; you can confidently state that they&rsquo;d be far more detailed than your own&hellip; you are aware that he has a somewhat&hellip; coarse personality, and only a passing acquaintance with the concept of emotional restraint. &nbsp;Given that this gathering does seem to also be somewhat political in nature, he is a poor candidate to send, and would possibly result in a poor impression of the Crag people in general. &nbsp;While, you admit, you were hoping to be able to sway the Esteemed into sending someone other than yourself, there are likely superior candidates that could be sent. &nbsp;It would be more sensible to pursue these alternatives, even though that might increase the odds that you get sent anyway as the others likely have no more interest in travelling into the Lowlands than you do. &nbsp;Time to back out of your previous statement gracefully.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;Whatever information or equipment I can provide to help you in this endeavor is at your disposal.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;I&hellip; Layer, thank you! &nbsp;Why, with your backing, I&rsquo;m sure the Esteemed will actually consider my proposal! She does seem to place great stock in your advice, and might I say, for good reason!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Darn. &nbsp;Not a lot of wiggle room to back out of that flub.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Oh well. &nbsp;Maybe the travel will tire him so much he won&rsquo;t be able to incite any conflict. &nbsp;You certainly felt nearly completely drained of all desire to liv- to interact energetically with Lowlanders by the time you arrived at the last Potluck. &nbsp;May as well make the best of an error.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;Indeed. &nbsp;In order to properly support you, it would likely be best if I understood the fundamental reason for your request. &nbsp;You had mentioned that you had discovered, or conjectured, something which motivated this desire to learn more about Lowlanders. &nbsp;What is it that you have discovered?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c12 c6"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Uh&hellip; well&hellip; it&rsquo;s pretty technical. And there are many possible ways in which the information I&rsquo;m currently seeing could be flawed, or incomplete. &nbsp;But, in general, it can be summarized as&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;</span><span class="c6 c17 c10">...Population Bottleneck.</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">The words hang heavy in the still spring air. &nbsp;A chill, which for the first time in months has nothing to do with the unaccountably harsh winter, runs up your spine. &nbsp;When The First began his overblown and overly intricate explanation, you had feared the conclusion he was reaching. &nbsp;Now, there can be no doubt as to his meaning.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6">You are </span><span class="c15 c38">The Esteemed</span><span class="c1">, and for once, you are actually intimately familiar with what The First is babbling about. &nbsp;After all, one of the most vital roles of the Elpahka is to oversee the health and wellbeing of the Crag people, and first and foremost of that duty is to ensure that there can be no threat to the most fundamental tool you possess to continue walking The Path your ancestors laid before you. &nbsp;However, it seems shocking that he could have reached such a conclusion; while there was some concern that might have been the case following the Extermination, all retained and recovered lore held that your population was sufficiently large to escape such a fate. &nbsp;While your first instinct is to use this lore to deny his calamitous proclamation, you reign yourself in; if nothing else, The First is thorough in his research, and would likely not overlook such a fact.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">However, his pause makes it clear that he fully expects you to. &nbsp;Although is face is lined with worry and fatigue, you cannot help but notice the small twinge of excitement that lies behind his eyes. He is fully prepared to demonstrate his mastery of a subject, especially if he can elaborate how much more he knows on said subject than you do. &nbsp;Very well. &nbsp;Why not indulge him this time? </span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;This is a serious discovery, First. I know of the malady of which you speak. &nbsp;Elaborate on your findings.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">He seems surprised. &nbsp;That reaction, in and of itself, is somewhat telling. &nbsp;Surprised that you would simply ask him to continue? &nbsp;Perhaps you have been overly combative with him, as of late. &nbsp;True, he provides ample reason to do so, but perhaps it would be wise to moderate yourself. &nbsp;Though his juvenile ego still irks you, it would not do for you to stunt his potential to mature with continual antagonism.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Of course, Esteemed. &nbsp;I first noticed the discrepancy when I began the laborious task of finally making full collation of all of those who had survived the Extermination, what traits they bore&hellip; and, the far more grim task, determining who and which were lost. &nbsp;Of course, when I dug further, my first consideration was to confer with the records taken immediately afterwards&hellip; some of them compiled by your own hand, Esteemed&hellip; and double checked to confirm what that ancient census had shown. &nbsp;While those records asserted that we should have a sufficiently large population to avoid this issue, the unfortunate truth is that mere population count was insufficient.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">The unfortunate truth of the matter is&hellip; well&hellip; to put it bluntly, the </span><span class="c23 c15">Animals </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;were not considerate enough to take an evenly distributed approach to slaughtering our population. &nbsp;While we have the numbers, it appears that some bloodlines bore the brunt of losses far more than others; indeed, within the Great bloodlines, many lesser lines seem to have been lost in their entirety, particularly those which were concentrated in settlements other than Eschaton. &nbsp;While this is a- a grievous loss in and of itself, the truth is that the telling damage of this loss lies not in what traits we have lost&hellip; but in which traits we may not be able to&hellip; prevent.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Although he had some of his excited spark at the outset, even through clouded eyes you can see as his passion dims, replaced by somber spirit. &nbsp;You are right in step beside him; while his presentation is far more dramatic than is necessary, it cannot be denied that the fate he portents could be as dooming to the continuation of the Crag people as the Blight which was so narrowly avoided. &nbsp;Yet, &nbsp;in spite of your rising horror, you cannot help but feel some tinge of satisfaction at this behavior. &nbsp;Perhaps, finally, he is finding himself capable of a degree of empathy. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;As our current Census grows more complete, I only find more evidence of this unfortunate fact. &nbsp;While there is still more to confirm, I fear that the result is already self evident. &nbsp;For us to conduct the Next Generation, we will need to take the utmost care in our pairings, lest we inadvertently run the risk of expressing&hellip; undesirable&hellip; traits. &nbsp;But that is not the end of our woes.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">With what traits seem available at present among our population, it may be that within a mere four more Generations, it will be impossible to avoid a risk of undesirable expression.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6">And there it is. &nbsp;The rueful prognosis. &nbsp;In spite of all hardship, in spite of countless generations of endeavor, the dream of the First Generation has died. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c23 c15">Animals </span><span class="c1">did not even have the courtesy to eradicate your people properly. &nbsp;Instead, they left them to bleed out slowly. &nbsp;Cruelly. &nbsp;Painfully.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">The realization is so massive, so powerful, that you cannot even respond correctly. &nbsp;It is as if even you, the supposedly wisest and most insightful, for which you even bear an ancient name, are incapable of truly perceiving the great wall of misery that such a proclamation portents. &nbsp;In the face of all that you have survived, all that Eschaton has survived, all that the Crag have survived, to hear that it is all without meaning is&hellip; impossible to truly grasp.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">You turn your gaze to Slabal, who had accompanied The First to this meeting. &nbsp;At first, you had questioned why she would have done so, but now you are merely content to appreciate her staid presence. &nbsp;Although the realization of this apocalyptic fate must strike her as deeply as it does you, she endures the tidings with grace, remaining controlled, stoic. &nbsp;She does not crack, though is an impossible burden to bear.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Indeed, it seems as if the First is also incapable of appreciating the full scope of his own discovery. &nbsp;Though his face bears weary sorrow, it is only a small fraction of what he should be experiencing were he to truly understand. &nbsp;For all of his great knowledge, when it comes to such considerations, he is still so aggravatingly ignorant.</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Unless&hellip;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;... A more dire tiding I have not heard in our times, First. Is there nothing to be done?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gods damn him for his theatrics&hellip; well, no, please don&rsquo;t, evidently we still require his services, exasperating as they are&hellip; but there is that twinge of smugness upon his face. &nbsp;Of course he would not have come merely to tell you of a dire fate. &nbsp;No, that would be far too responsible. &nbsp;He would retain that information, studying and examining until he had found a solution&hellip; the only correct one, obviously. &nbsp;To merely tell of ill tidings would be too much like admitting he wasn&rsquo;t omniscient. &nbsp;He can&rsquo;t have that, obviously.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;There are&hellip; potential solutions, Esteemed. &nbsp;None of which I can currently guarantee, but the study has yet only begun. &nbsp;But for starters, there is evidence of a salve already present among our people; the group of lost Crag, recovered just this last Summer, bears diversity among them. &nbsp;Indeed, they may point to our ultimate source of salvation.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...Oh. &nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;Of course! The Wayward Kin! &nbsp;When you had first heard of the discovery of Crag who had survived beyond the walls of Eschaton, you could scarcely believe it so, but the simple fact that some have managed up to this point gives hope that there could be more out there! If they could be discovered and brought to Eschaton, this grim fate could be avoided!</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;An astute observation, First, and one which provides ample indication of where the Crag people must focus our efforts. &nbsp;Although I believe that some efforts are already underway to conduct a search for more such wayward kin, it is likely that the Aggro are not yet directing their full resources to it. &nbsp;I will contact Echo&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...Wait. &nbsp;He is frowning. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;With all respect to their capabilities, Esteemed, I cannot put great faith in there being sufficiently more of these&hellip; Wayward kin&hellip; to resolve our problem. &nbsp;After all, those that we had found were on the verge of collapse, and had we not discovered them now, they surely would have faced harsh, even lethal, conditions as this intemperate winter set upon us. &nbsp;After all, for all that we suffered here in Eschaton, I can only imagine that down there, in the Lowlands, where there is no elevation to escape such weather, it must have been far worse. Although, somewhat befitting your inclinations of late, I believe that a far more plausible solution may, indeed, lie in the Lowlands.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">What?</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I have worked studiously to compile as many first-hand accounts as could feasibly be attained regarding the nature and&hellip; design of our Lowland kin. &nbsp;Though they are, of course, degenerate in their forms, possessed of a chaotic medley of shapes, I believe it is possible that they could represent a salve to our ailment.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">What.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;Indeed, from my collected accounts, I believe that there is no indication that they cannot serve as a potential&hellip; </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">emergency reservoir</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of distinctiveness that could be utilized to avoid any potential complications from our current lack of distinctiveness.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c22 c34 c6 c10">What.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Even moreso, although this is pending further investigation&hellip; which is the ultimate focal point of this meeting, I might add&hellip; I believe it is possible that they may even possess traits of their own which could be of benefit to us, should we carefully consider how best to express them. &nbsp;Doing so, of course, would require significant in depth and thoughtful analysis of our own nature, as well as theirs, and as such it would behoove us to perform a number of&hellip; fact-finding endeavors to make closer note of the nature and make of these Lowlanders. &nbsp;In particular, I am aware that they appear to have a ritual day, or some equivalent thereof, in which Lowlanders of all natures congregate, collecting their distinct natures all in one concentration. &nbsp;While, in the past, you had believed The Layer to be an adequately equipped individual to conduct an expedition to this event, I would petition you to instead allow me to be in attendance. &nbsp;While there, I would be able to collect untold scrolls of vital information regarding their nature, and thus divine whether they could serve as the potential salvation of all of the Crag!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">There is a prolonged silence in the Pagoda. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You make a fearsome, concerted effort to control both your face, and your stomach.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although he has couched it in all manner of dry terminology, his intentions are plain as the sun.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You had believed yourself accustomed to some of The First&rsquo;s audacities, but what lay beneath his supposedly innocent request is unbelievable. It is sickening. &nbsp;And, most damnably of all, it is </span><span class="c6 c10">presumptuous </span><span class="c6">For it seems he thinks himself capable of </span><span class="c6 c10">tinkering</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;with </span><span class="c6 c10">The Path.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">It takes you a long time to collect your thoughts. &nbsp;To calm yourself to the point where you trusted even your perpetually steady voice to retain its stoic tone. &nbsp;It is enough time for you to see the eager smile upon his face begin to droop. &nbsp;It is clear that he had let your earlier permissiveness go to his head.<br>You gave him far too much credit before. &nbsp;He has not matured in the slightest.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;First Among Scholars. &nbsp;The Fate you have unveiled is overwhelming in scope. &nbsp;It is all too understandable that, in the face of such a discovery, you have lost all sense of decorum. &nbsp;While I can scarcely imagine how you allowed yourself to become so unbalanced as to give in to these perversions, I am prepared to forgive you in light of the import of your discovery.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">He is shocked. &nbsp;As well he should be. &nbsp;It is an unsettling thing to be caught when so compromised. &nbsp;You, yourself, are all too aware of how maddening it can be to have your unknown weaknesses exposed.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Per-Perversions?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">His face is turning scarlet. &nbsp;As well he should be. &nbsp;You can only imagine the depths of his chagrin.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;Perversions, First.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well more than his face, now. &nbsp;It is as if his entire body, including his impressively displayed fivehead, was dipped in deep cochineal.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c22 c6 c17 c40 c10">&ldquo;Perversions?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c22 c6 c17 c40 c10"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;Perversions! &nbsp;First Among Scholars, Renyan Elematich, I have given you a great deal of leeway when considering your youthful nature, but it is deeply disappointing to me that you would allow yourself to be so clouded by your baser desires. &nbsp;I understand that in your phase of life, a young Crag may find it all but impossible to control themselves appropriately in this regard, but I had believed that you possessed a maturity to rise above such. &nbsp;That I have now borne witness to such an outrageous display of juvenile philia forces me to reconsider that position. &nbsp;For now, it would be best if you were to-&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17 c10">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it again, you foolish, wrinkled old toad!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...You had thought you were stunned before by The First&rsquo;s discovery. &nbsp;Now, you find yourself literally so. &nbsp;The sheer disrespect displayed seems to have a literally paralyzing effect on you. &nbsp;You are speechless.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">For his part, The First seems almost as shocked as you. Bald panic plays upon his face, replacing his rictus of rage.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Behind him, you can see your guards tighten their grips. &nbsp;If you could move, they might have already been in motion.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Even Slabal, ever staid Slabal, seems concerned at this unheard of breach of protocol. &nbsp;Her eyes widen slightly. </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">And yet, of all of you, it is The First who is the first to recover. &nbsp;Rather than begging forgiveness, however, his face twists back to superlative anger, and he begins his tirade anew.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;For one fleeting moment, could you finally look past my youth, and consider that I may be suggesting this for something </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">other</span><span class="c6 c17">&nbsp;than my hedonistic gratification?! &nbsp;That I may actually be trying to suggest something because I legitimately think that it is in the best interests, not just of myself, but of the Crag people?! &nbsp;That it could be </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">theoretically possible</span><span class="c6 c17">&nbsp;that the time, effort, countless calculations, restless nights, and panic-fueled ingenuity I&rsquo;ve spent could all ultimately be in service to something </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">bigger than my di-</span><span class="c6 c17">sires?! &nbsp;What if that just so happened to be the case?! &nbsp;What if I&rsquo;m actually trying to find ways to prevent a disaster </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">before</span><span class="c6 c17">&nbsp;it happens, rather than having to </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">let it happen</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and then try to figure out how to survive anyways?!</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">What is even the </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">point</span><span class="c6 c17">&nbsp;of being &ldquo;First Among Scholars&rdquo; if I am to be ignored anyway for what my intentions </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">could</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;be? &nbsp;Am I to be an Oracle of the old tragedies, forever correct but forever dismissed?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">He slumps in on himself, a low groan crawling through his throat as he begins to rub his temples. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You are still shocked, but recovering. &nbsp;You pray to the gods that he just leaves, but distressingly, he just stands there, rubbing his face and then looking at you, still angry, but his fury spent. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well.<br>Fuck.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ve really trapped yourself this time. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6"><br>The problems is, gods damn him- and this time, really, feel free to do so- he&rsquo;s </span><span class="c6 c10">right.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; The simple fact is that, when it comes to logical, thoughtfully considered judgment calls, he&rsquo;s been correct far more often than you have. &nbsp;If you had paid attention to him years ago, it&rsquo;s possible the Blight would have never happened. &nbsp;If he had been allowed to travel with the Aggro the first time he asked, he might have discovered something that would have blunted its effects. &nbsp;Even his proposal to survive the Blight, as shocking, cruel, and remorseless as it was, was factually correct. &nbsp;It was only because of the bravery- foolish, headstrong bravery, but bravery nonetheless- of Echo and his Euclast warriors that the worst-case scenario he predicted was avoided, and then, only narrowly; even now, you still cannot claim that Eschaton has completely recovered. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...It suddenly occurs to you that you have not seen Echo in these chambers for nearly a year. &nbsp;Even when you went among the Crag people, you spotted no trace of him. &nbsp;You had heard that he was injured badly in the flames which befell the Aggro, but you would never expect any injury to afflict him for this long. &nbsp;Not the Echo of Blood. &nbsp;While you have had no desire to summon him&hellip; especially not with the disrespect he presented the entire Wisdom with his crude interruption&hellip; but it just now occurred to you that the wounds which afflicted him may be deeper than the flesh. &nbsp;You should attempt to make time to speak with him. &nbsp;While you do not expect it to be a pleasant conversation, it is the Responsibility of the Elpahka to aid the hurting&hellip; and with things as they are now, you cannot afford to lose such a potent symbol of Eschaton&rsquo;s might.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">But speaking of disrespect- while the First is more than likely correct, damn him, the fact that he has thrown such a public tantrum puts you in a bind. &nbsp;You cannot simply now accept his proposal. &nbsp;It would be a surefire sign of your failing abilities&hellip; and worse, he would be even more unbearable for the victory. &nbsp;It occurs to you that you could just deny him any way. &nbsp;By his own admission, this is an issue that will only become truly insurmountable four generations hence. &nbsp;In all likelihood, by that time, you will be long dead, and whatever told-you-so&rsquo;s he might inflict upon you won&rsquo;t matter.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...You had meant that as a joke. &nbsp;Actually thinking it out loud, it distresses you how sincerely you felt it.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Well, one thing is clear. &nbsp;That absolutely is not an option. &nbsp;You might be old, tired, and probably incapable, but Ancestors all condemn you till every hell take you, you are </span><span class="c6 c10">not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;going to make another poor call just for the sake of appearances.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1"><br>Thankfully, you have an out&hellip; likely, one that was brought along for this express purpose, but in this case, you&rsquo;ll gladly use it, even if it was intended to work against you.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;Slabal. &nbsp;I would hear your counsel. &nbsp;What do you believe the truth of The First&rsquo;s proposal is?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">She stares at you, and then at The First, with that stare she always uses. &nbsp;It is a comforting stare.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c12 c6">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it is actually motivated by perversions. &nbsp;In my experience, The First has never tended to obscure or make subtle his motives or desires. I have never known him to prevaricate or dissemble when simply stating, or shouting, his opinions would do. &nbsp;At most, he has attempted to manipulate others by attempting to make a strong positive impression. &nbsp;I would think him honest in this regard. &nbsp;In particular, I feel that his open nature and free speaking tone may allow him to&hellip; converse&hellip; and blend more freely with the L- Otherelves than I was capable of doing. &nbsp;I believe his proposal is worth considering.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c6 c12"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well. &nbsp;Hardly glowing praise, but by Slabal&rsquo;s standards, it may as well be. &nbsp;Such stoic wisdom. &nbsp;Sometimes, you wish you could be half as unflappable. &nbsp;Perhaps then you would not make so many errors.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&ldquo;Words spoken with thoughtful insight. &nbsp;First Among Scholars, you choose your company well, although I would advise you to take a more active approach in emulating her. &nbsp;Her method of speaking and clear purpose leave no room for misunderstanding or failed communication. &nbsp;You may find that such methods lack the theatrics and braggadocio to which you are accustomed, but I hope that you will find that a small price to pay in return for fewer&hellip; mistakes, such as these.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c8">I will consider your request with patient, thoughtful care. &nbsp;For now, however, I believe it will likely be best for you to return to your resting quarters, and remain there until you have had </span><span class="c6 c7">ample, </span><span class="c6 c8">perhaps even </span><span class="c7 c6">excessive</span><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40">&nbsp;opportunity to clear your mind, rest, and recover from your long studies. &nbsp;While none may fault your dedication to the Bakshish tenets of learnedness, you will find that most also learn how to moderate their dedication as to avoid taking such a heavy toll on their temperament. &nbsp;You may go now.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c19 c6 c8 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">There. &nbsp;Once again, you have threaded the needle. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">As you watch the slumped form of The First and Slabal descend from your pavillion, you cannot help but admit a traitorous addition; </span><span class="c22 c6 c10 c34">For now.</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You are </span><span class="c15 c38">The First</span><span class="c1">.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">A part of you really wants to cry right about now.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Another, much, </span><span class="c6 c10">much</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;larger part of you really wants to make someone </span><span class="c6 c10">else</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cry right about now.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thankfully, as you recall, you have a meeting with Drivel later today.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sometimes, the devils of misfortune work in your favor&hellip; particularly when they target someone else.</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Solid stone paces beneath your feet. &nbsp;Although you are more than accustomed to ruggedness, in this instance, it is a welcome change from the jagged, untamed peaks and snow-covered cliffs which have been your reality for the past several months. &nbsp;But as unpleasant as they may have been, you would be out there still, probably risking your life gladly in pursuit of thin leads, if you did not bear the poisonous knowledge that you have been saddled with. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You used to wonder what the origin of that expression was. &nbsp;Then you learned that Lowlanders use a &ldquo;saddle&rdquo; to make riding their mounts easier. &nbsp;Since then, it has struck you as odd that an idiom meaning &ldquo;to be burdened with&rdquo; is sourced from a tool that lets a creature perform its appointed task easier. &nbsp;You wonder if there&rsquo;s an art in that irony. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">It took you many weeks to come to terms with the information you now carry, and to decide how you would act upon it. &nbsp;It haunted you to think that you had considered going back on your word. &nbsp;That you would think share your secret with one, but not the one you had intended, not the one you promised. &nbsp;That you would even think to disgrace yourself so.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, upon full consideration, the answer has become far more clear; after all, you are already disgraced.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although at the time, you had assuaged yourself that living was your duty as a Stalker, to report on what you had found, you now realize that such justification was nothing more than base cowardice. &nbsp;The moment your suspicions had been fully confirmed, your duty was clear, even at the cost of your life. &nbsp;And yet, you failed. &nbsp;You let them go, to continue whatever unthinkable acts they were performing. &nbsp;You let them go, just to spare your own life.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You have already become Disgra. &nbsp;Piling another disgrace on will scarcely effect that.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">And so, you, </span><span class="c15 c38">Stalker Embebi</span><span class="c1">, find yourself pacing automatically down the smoothed roads of Eschaton on the way to the Circle. &nbsp;When you first arrived, it shocked you how much the city had changed in your absence. &nbsp;So many familiar structures, ruins though they may be, had ceased to exist entirely. &nbsp;Great swaths of Eschaton could now be seen from ground level. &nbsp;It was&hellip; surprisingly comforting, to bear witness to such open space in a place once so clogged with destruction. &nbsp;However, even now you can see industrious Onagi and dutiful Samra working tirelessly to ruin that vista once more. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You shake your head. &nbsp;Your mind is focusing on everything </span><span class="c6 c10">but</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the conversation ahead. &nbsp;Not surprising, but also not the frame of mind you need to be in.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You enter the Circle, greeted curtly by the guards posted outside. &nbsp;To your surprise, they seem a little&hellip; sallow. &nbsp;Slumped. &nbsp;You can scarcely imagine what would happen to induce such a state.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Oh, come on. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c10">Focus.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1"><br>It is a mark of the greatest of Stalkers to be able to locate their quarry swiftly, silently. &nbsp;This task is a little less impressive when said quarry looms head and shoulders over the rest of the assembled Aggro. &nbsp;Especially when he also does so from a second floor railing. &nbsp;His eyes gaze intently into the center of the Grand Circle, in which a number of youths currently spar. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, you call them youths. &nbsp;In truth, they are far closer to adults than children; already, you can see the hard lines of their adult bodies forming, growing muscle, toughening sinew, hardening flesh. &nbsp;It would be a triumphant sight, were it not for the implicit reminder of how few are the numbers to take their place in training. &nbsp;<br>By now, even you with your far-flung travels had managed to hear the rumors of the Next Generation. &nbsp;You hoped to all the ancestors that there were no complications. &nbsp;The Aggro could scarcely afford it.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Quietly, you pad beside your sib. &nbsp;From here, the focus of his gaze is obvious; a youth with deep, moss green hair. &nbsp;Already, she cuts an impressive figure, two full inches taller than her opponent. She uses that size to full advantage, her reach and posture driving the opponent back, giving him no openings and leaving him little opportunity to deflect each blow. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Welcome back, Sib. &nbsp;Did you enjoy your walk?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">There is jocularity in his tone. &nbsp;There always is, to start. &nbsp;Sadly, you cannot muster the same. &nbsp;Although traditionally you would start your meetings with some appropriate bants, this time you must disappoint. &nbsp;How appropriate.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Hail, Echo of Blood. &nbsp;Stalker Embebi has returned for debriefing.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">His face loses its cocksure grin, replaced with an expression of curiosity.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Ack, and well met, Stalker Embebi. &nbsp;We shall debrief forthwith. &nbsp;What have you to report?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You shake your head, sending your hair tumbling around you. &nbsp;His grin fades further.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Echo of Blood, I request debrief in confidence. &nbsp;Opsec.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Ack, aff. &nbsp;Come with me, Stalker Embebi.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">As he leaves his position on the rails, you hear the tortured metal squeak as it returns to its previous position. &nbsp;However, you notice that it still remains bent out of true. &nbsp;This must be a favorite spot of his. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The debriefing room is small, but efficient. &nbsp;Four chairs, a small table, a lantern and an empty scroll are all that reside here. &nbsp;Echo lights the lantern from the sconce outside, takes a chair- the one without arms, natch- and pointedly ignores the scroll. &nbsp;You sit opposite him. &nbsp;You can feel your pulse quickening. &nbsp;Without a doubt, part of it is the close confines of the room. &nbsp;The other part is how difficult the table makes it to reach your kuthe.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;So. &nbsp;Echo of Blood, debriefing Stalker Embebi, regarding recent patrol into the Highlands. &nbsp;Report, Stalker Embebi.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You exhale, centering yourself. &nbsp;Best to start at the beginning.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Patrol into the highlands revealed little we did not anticipate. &nbsp;Turns out they are high. &nbsp;Turns out they are lands. &nbsp;Little more of interest can be explicitly noted. &nbsp;Maps detailing the area were made, as per new standing regulations regarding exploratory ventures. &nbsp;In spite of this, the area remains treacherous and difficult to navigate, owing to a lack of reliable landmarks and shifting features due to weather. &nbsp;Still, patrol&rsquo;s objective to scout the area, more or less successful.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;More or less?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Apologies. &nbsp;The objective was definitively successful, though success was of low practical utility.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Noted. &nbsp;And of your secondary objective?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You chew your lip. &nbsp;There is still more to tell before the fatal moment, but it is approaching far faster than you really prepared for. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not sure if you could have ever prepared for it, honestly.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6 c33">&ldquo;Secondary objective to identify and recover any Lost Kin met with&hellip; mixed results. &nbsp;Path was difficult to follow, particularly owing to obvious reasons; little impressionable territory, regular weather fluctuations, so forth. &nbsp;Still, sufficient evidence was found to point towards a general direction. &nbsp;The most conclusive evidence was discovered right before the unusually punishing winter required artebe to be announced, in order to resupply, rotate roster, and relieve walking wounded. &nbsp;Casualties were few, and largely non-serious, but given unusually harsh conditions it seemed wiser to return to quarry after conval. &nbsp;However, on return trip, more evidence was discovered. &nbsp;Appeared to be another Stalker, deceased, likely from Lost Kin. &nbsp;He bore a map which seems to indicate potential avenues of escape that could have been used by Lost Kin. &nbsp;This provides the most straightforward lead we&rsquo;ve discovered so far. &nbsp;In addition, by all reports, the Stalker was carrying a page of </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">The Tome</span><span class="c19 c6 c31">.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;...&rsquo;By all reports&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You swallow.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;By all reports. &nbsp;This was the information relayed to Bakshish scholars when the recovered page was remanded into their care. &nbsp;Officially, it is the origin of the recovered page.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Out with it, Embebi.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is it. &nbsp;The moment. &nbsp;The moment that may well define the rest of your life. &nbsp;However short it may be.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, maybe not? &nbsp;You still haven&rsquo;t said anything conclusive. &nbsp;You could still play it off as a joke! Hah ha, just being overly formal with you, sib, great to see you!</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">God, even hearing it in your head, you know he&rsquo;s not stupid enough to accept that. &nbsp;And you know exactly how sharp he is. &nbsp;In all the dangerous ways.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you told him anything, then you have to tell him everything.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">So, you tell him </span><span class="c6 c48"><a class="c44" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-rAJPzi8m5VPqzdloGuqCBCW1GjnxsZAtbgRB_rYDY/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1576734111897000">everything.</a></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">What you did. &nbsp;Who you encountered. &nbsp;What they said. &nbsp;What you suspected. &nbsp;What you saw. &nbsp;What you didn&rsquo;t do.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You give it in as much detail as you can. &nbsp;You relate the entire exchange, as best as you can recall. &nbsp;Every detail you picked up on. &nbsp;Every little thing that irked your suspicion. &nbsp;How you repressed it. &nbsp;How that made you a coward.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">During the entire report, he says nothing. &nbsp;He looks at you. &nbsp;Eyes furrowed. &nbsp;Massive brows smashing together. &nbsp;Every time you pause, give him opportunity to respond, he just frowns, and grunts, and then you continue detailing your failure.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the end of the telling, you are drained. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve heard that for many Crag, telling a great secret feels like a relief. &nbsp;You feel nothing of the sort. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once you are finished, silence reigns. &nbsp;He says nothing. &nbsp;He just frowns. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s thinking. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t even imagine what. &nbsp;All you can tell is that rage is involved. &nbsp;With him, that tells you nothing.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, he takes a deep breath.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Sib, I&rsquo;m disappointed in you.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You grimace. &nbsp;You were expecting him to do so much worse. &nbsp;Surprising how that simple statement can be worse than the worse. &nbsp;Because it does not yet preclude the worse.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;I am aware. &nbsp;I am Disgra. &nbsp;I have failed. &nbsp;I cannot-&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">&ldquo;</span><span class="c13 c10">Shut up.</span><span class="c13 c19">&nbsp; I am disappointed that you could possibly consider yourself to be Disgra. &nbsp;I cannot imagine what foolishness led you to that idea.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">...well, now you don&rsquo;t know </span><span class="c6 c10">what</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;to think.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;...but... &nbsp;I showed cowardice. &nbsp;I made myself pitiful. &nbsp;I made promises, and now break them, just to save myself. &nbsp;I-&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">&ldquo;</span><span class="c13 c10">Shut. Up.</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;You make a fool of yourself, Embebi. &nbsp;Is it Disgra to make a feint? &nbsp;Is it Disgra to lay an ambush? &nbsp;</span><span class="c13 c10">You misled an enemy.</span><span class="c13 c19">&nbsp; You broke no oaths. &nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t have. &nbsp;It is nothing short of ridiculous that you could have convinced yourself otherwise. &nbsp;Your instinct was fully correct. &nbsp;You used misdirection and subterfuge to ensure that command became aware of a threat.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">No, Embebi, your disgraceful behavior has nothing to do with Conduct Before the Foe. &nbsp;What I am more disappointed in is that you let yourself be concerned with your conduct. &nbsp;The only reason I can possibly imagine that you would even </span><span class="c13 c10">think</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;to be remorseful&hellip; is if in your odd, xenophilic little soul, you were not completely certain they </span><span class="c13 c10">were</span><span class="c13 c19">&nbsp;an enemy.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You cringe. &nbsp;In spite of what he&rsquo;s saying, you simply cannot shake the thought that you acted shamefully. &nbsp;It feels like he&rsquo;s being easy on you. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a repugnant feeling. It feels like </span><span class="c6 c10">pity.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;And the truly despicable, insane thing about the world we now live in is&hellip; you may not be entirely wrong to be uncertain.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Hot fury springs into your chest. &nbsp;Your pulse quickens. &nbsp;It is one thing to pity you, to be lenient, out of some bizarre feelings of protectiveness. &nbsp;It is entirely another to try to paint this failure as a </span><span class="c6 c10">good thing</span><span class="c1">.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6 c33">&ldquo;</span><span class="c6 c33 c10">Gooseplop</span><span class="c6 c33">, Saltik! Don&rsquo;t you try to coat this over! &nbsp;Did you hear what I said? &nbsp;What they were? &nbsp;What they were </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">pretending</span><span class="c19 c6 c31">&nbsp;to be? &nbsp;They&rsquo;re grotesque! &nbsp;There can be no forgiveness for showing cowardice before them, as I did!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">A low, dangerous growl tumbles from his throat. &nbsp;He remains seated, but his hand clasps around the table edge. &nbsp;You can already hear the stone creaking.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">&ldquo;Yes, Embebi, I heard you! Did you hear yourself? &nbsp;They told you that they </span><span class="c13 c10">admired</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;the Crag. &nbsp;Saw wisdom in our ancestors&rsquo; teachings! &nbsp;When would you ever expect to hear that from an outsider? &nbsp;The whole purpose of the Aggro was to defend against those who would see what we are, and hate us, destroy us, wish to Exterminate us! &nbsp;They wish to be </span><span class="c13 c10">like us!</span><span class="c13 c19">&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6 c33">&ldquo;</span><span class="c6 c33 c10">And that desire is twisted!</span><span class="c6 c33">&nbsp;They see our ancestors teachings, but it cannot possibly be that they truly understand it! Look what they seek to emulate! Look who they wish to become! &nbsp;Our ancestors dreamed of a people that would </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">rise</span><span class="c6 c33">&nbsp;from barbarism and animalistic chaos, not </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">pursue</span><span class="c19 c6 c31">&nbsp;it!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The table begins to shake. &nbsp;If you were thinking more clearly, this would be a point of great concern, as the table was actually willed as part of the room. &nbsp;It is not merely attached to the floor- it is part of it.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">&ldquo;</span><span class="c13 c10">So what</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;if they pursue those traits? &nbsp;To make a thing a part of yourself is not to </span><span class="c13 c10">be</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;that thing! We are more than formless stone, and yet our Ancestors saw the strength that lied within the mountain, wished it to be a part of themselves! The mountain was cruel, vicious, claimed their lives, and they were </span><span class="c13 c10">impressed</span><span class="c13 c19">&nbsp;by it!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You feel your blood begin to sing. &nbsp;If any part of your conscious mind was involved in this argument, it would be screaming at you to stop. &nbsp;Unfortunately, you&rsquo;re well past the point of rationality. &nbsp;Conscious thought is out the window. In fact, here, lets try it. &nbsp;You want to stop arguing. &nbsp;No good can come of it. &nbsp;Please stop.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6 c33">&ldquo;</span><span class="c6 c33 c10">What in the fuck are you saying?!</span><span class="c6 c33">&nbsp;You would compare the </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">Mountains</span><span class="c6 c33">&nbsp;to </span><span class="c23 c15">Animals</span><span class="c6 c33">?! The Mountain did not </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">intend</span><span class="c6 c33">&nbsp;to kill! The mountain did not </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">plan</span><span class="c6 c33">&nbsp;to kill! </span><span class="c6 c33 c10">The Mountain did not systematically, methodically, willfully kill us, our friends, our </span><span class="c22 c31 c15 c10 c38">people, our future!!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">&ldquo;</span><span class="c13 c22 c10">YES! They killed! They killed and killed and killed and killed! They were GOOD at killing! They were HARD to kill! Every single damned one of them felled was a heroic feat! Do you think that if I could have that Strength, that Resilience, &nbsp;yet be free of their Madness, that I would hesitate for a MOMENT to claim it?! To have that Killing Prowess myself? To give it to my DESCENDENTS?!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Instincts honed from a lifetime of struggle, of training, and of conflict work in tandem to keep your bile in your stomach, your urine in your bladder, and pump untold amounts of combat drugs into your system to prepare you for conflict. &nbsp;You slam your fists into the tabletop, hard enough to leave dimples of blood, and yet you feel no pain. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t feel anything but anger. &nbsp;But burning veins. &nbsp;But Killing Intent.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6 c33">&ldquo;</span><span class="c15 c33 c38 c10">You sick fuck! &nbsp;How can you say that?! YOU, of all Crag! You were the greatest of us at felling them! The greatest at defeating that Killing Prowess! And yet now, you would disgrace yourself so far as to JOIN THEM?! &nbsp;DO YOU REVERE SLAUGHTER SO MUCH?! HUNGER FOR BLOOD SO DEEPLY?! ALL THIS TIME, WERE YOU NOTHING BUT AN </span><span class="c23 c15">Animal</span><span class="c22 c31 c15 c38 c10">&nbsp;IN DISGUISE?!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">A sharp groan fills the room, before a thundering crumble rebounds from the narrow walls. &nbsp;The table pulls away from you, hurled against the wall, smashing to jagged cobbles. In an instant, you are on your feet, hands darting to your kuthe&hellip; but your reflexes are nothing compared to those honed by countless close quarter engagements. &nbsp;To be a Stalker is to kill your enemy, seeing them, but never being seen. &nbsp;In toe-to-toe fights? &nbsp;Not such a useful skillset.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Bleeding hands clamp around your arms, </span><span class="c6 c10">squeezing.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You feel yourself lifted into the air, your bones grinding together. &nbsp;Vast cords of muscle contract, and although the pain you feel is just a polite reminder, it becomes ever more urgent as the pressure mounts. &nbsp;His bare chest, coated with scars, his arms, etched with countless marks, his burns, only recently healed, all bulge as the raw strength beneath them works in tandem to crush the very life from your frame.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;You glare, wild eyed, into your sib&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;His eyes have shrunk to pinpricks. His teeth are clenched so tight, you can scarcely tell where top ends and bottom begins. Blood, rich and red, pounds through veins that stand out on his neck and forehead. He is no longer in any way Saltik, your Sib. &nbsp;He is Echo of Blood.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Maybe you should have listened to your conscious thoughts, quiaff?</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c15 c27">&ldquo;</span><span class="c27 c22 c15 c10">Look at me, Embebi! Look at how they scarred me, how they broke me, how many of them I killed, how many of my own they killed around me! Look at what I am, what they made me, not a Crag, not an Aggro, but a weapon that bleeds!<br>Do you think me any more fond of them than you?!</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c27 c22 c15 c10">DO YOU THINK ME MORE FORGIVING? MORE MERCIFUL?</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c22 c46 c15 c38 c10">DO YOU THINK MY RAGE BURNS LESS BRIGHTLY?</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c22 c15 c38 c10 c43">THIS IS WHAT THEY SAW BEFORE THEY DIED!</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c15 c38 c10 c42">DOES THIS LOOK LIKE MERCY TO YOU?</span><span class="c22 c15 c38 c10 c46">&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">A soft snap echoes in the room, and the polite reminder of your pain pushes its way to the fore, insisting that, yes, this is indeed a priority now.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">As you were afraid might happen, you cannot reach your kuthe. &nbsp;As luck would have it, however, your wild thrashing in Echo&rsquo;s steel grip finally yields some results. &nbsp;His hands, bloody from when they wrenched a table from the floor, allow you to slip a few centimeters down, unpinning your elbows. &nbsp;Sadly, this shift only further encourages the pain to distract you.<br>No chance of retrieving your kuthe now. &nbsp;Only one option remains. &nbsp;You wriggle your left hand, and, with some mixture of skill and luck, manage to slip your lith from its scabbard. </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">With every ounce of your fading strength, you swing your arm around, plunging the lith all the way up to the hilt &nbsp;in one of the freshly-healed burns upon his arm. &nbsp;To your pleasant surprise, you actually manage to draw blood. It wells slowly around the lith&rsquo;s grip, slowly oozing from his arm and onto the floor.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The squeezing stops. There is a pause.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You are released, and crash to the ground. &nbsp;Your legs try to support your weight, but robbed of oxygen, they give way. &nbsp;Fortunately, you manage to fall on the arm that hadn&rsquo;t broken yet.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">As you lay, panting on the cold stone floor, flooding your spent body with precious air, you reflect on how you really, really wish you had listened to your conscious thought.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">See, this is why you don&rsquo;t like enclosed spaces. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no room to disengage.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Fortunately, you knew your sib as few others did. &nbsp;While in many Aggro, pain seemed to drive them into a frenzy, for Saltik, it always seemed to focus him. &nbsp;Alert him. &nbsp;Bring him to the fore. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve often thought that the only times he really </span><span class="c6 c10">existed </span><span class="c1">was when he hurt. &nbsp;It was what made him so fucking dangerous.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, good job remembering how fucking dangerous he is when you got in a screaming match with him in an enclosed space, by the way.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Look, if your internal monologue could give it a rest, you&rsquo;d really appreciate it. You got the message, quiaff?</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Saltik sags. &nbsp;You breathe out a shaky sigh of relief. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">He grabs the lith, and yanks it out of his arm, dropping it unceremoniously onto the floor. &nbsp;You notice that the tip is gone. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s probably in him somewhere. &nbsp; Either he&rsquo;ll get it, or he won&rsquo;t.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">With surprising gentleness, he picks you up from the floor, resting you in the only still-upright chair.. &nbsp;He manages to avoid touching your broken arm as he does so. </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You look at the arm. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s out of line&hellip; probably a stable fracture. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve had worse. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a bitch and three quarters to fire a bow with a splint, though.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Saltik squats in front of you, which actually just brings you face to face. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s examining the arm as well. &nbsp;Probably coming to the same conclusion as you.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Stable, probably. &nbsp;It should heal well, but will take some time.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">He sighs explosively, putting his palm against his forehead. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;...Embebi, please understand. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen us suffer so much. &nbsp;Endure so much. &nbsp;And yet for every trial we overcome, another one awaits. &nbsp;And, while each makes us stronger, in a way, it also seems like they make us weaker as well. &nbsp;And yet, when new hardship comes, it is always the Aggro who must bear it first. &nbsp;We have always done so. &nbsp;We will always do so. But I fear the day comes when each trial makes us more weak than it makes us strong.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">And so, yes. &nbsp;I desire strength. &nbsp;More for myself. &nbsp;More for our people. &nbsp;More for our descendents. &nbsp;And yes, I do not care overmuch where it came from. &nbsp;Those creatures I felled&hellip; I did not hate them for being strong. &nbsp;I did not hate them for being durable. &nbsp;I hated them for being </span><span class="c23 c15">Animals</span><span class="c13">. &nbsp;Those you spoke to&hellip; you </span><span class="c13 c10">spoke</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;to. &nbsp;They did not slay you out of hand. &nbsp;They did not drag you into bondage. &nbsp;They did not lay eyes on you, and think of naught but bloodshed. &nbsp;In all these things, it is clear. &nbsp;They are not </span><span class="c23 c15">Animals</span><span class="c13 c19">. &nbsp;Not yet.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Pained, spent, you had little interest in this conversation. &nbsp;Yet, something about the way he said that...</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Yet?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">&ldquo;Yet. &nbsp;I will not deny your wisdom. &nbsp;I cannot see the path they trod as encouraging. &nbsp;The Ancestors, the First Generation, were wise beyond any of us in their pursuit of perfection. &nbsp;They knew it would take untold time, untold generations, to reach it without flaw. &nbsp;These&hellip; Wolves&hellip; they already show too much of their heritage. &nbsp;They move too quickly. &nbsp;It is not to be trusted. &nbsp;But it is not yet enough to consign them to the same fate as all </span><span class="c15 c23">Animals</span><span class="c13 c19">.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;But what will be enough, Sib? &nbsp;Will we wait until the madness grips them, till blood becomes all they crave, until they come howling and screaming to the gates of Eschaton, keen to resume what their namesake began?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">His face turns sour once more. &nbsp;Careful.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;It may not need to come to that, Embebi. &nbsp;The simple truth is this; we do not know more than we know about them. &nbsp;That is a dangerous place to be, in any regard. &nbsp;You, however, have made the first great step. &nbsp;Because of your actions, because of your forethought, we know they exist. &nbsp;Now, we can take appropriate steps.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">And the first appropriate step, this time&hellip; is to study.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ancestors. &nbsp;Coming from him&hellip; you&rsquo;re afraid you may be hallucinating. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;I will go among them.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ah. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Not hallucinating. &nbsp;That sounds like him.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Sib, that is insane. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s&hellip; I can&rsquo;t really describe it other than to just say &lsquo;insane&rsquo; a bunch. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s insane, insane, insane, insane, and also with an extra side of stupid.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">He snorts. &nbsp;Hah. &nbsp;Point to you.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">&ldquo;Probably. &nbsp;However, I have spent far, far too long here. &nbsp;I have sulked long enough. &nbsp;I learned a harsh lesson in the fires at the foot of the Mountain. &nbsp;A lesson about brashness, about overconfidence. &nbsp;And yet, in spite of that lesson, my blood sings for </span><span class="c13 c10">Action</span><span class="c13 c19">. I yearn to do something. &nbsp;Anything that might help. &nbsp;Even insane things.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">He gives a tired grin.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Especially insane things.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">In spite of yourself, you manage to give a tired smile back.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Fair enough. &nbsp;Honestly, if you did anything sane, it&rsquo;d probably look insane because you did it.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">He gives a curt shrug. You sigh.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;Aff. &nbsp;We can take you and a small party with us on our next expedition. &nbsp;Since we&rsquo;ll be retreading that area, chances are we&rsquo;ll run across their like again. &nbsp;That&rsquo;ll give you opportunity to&hellip; Go among them, I guess.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The smile drops from his face. &nbsp;You become concerned.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Sib&hellip; your arm.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;What, just because it&rsquo;s broken? &nbsp;Hardly a trifle. &nbsp;Like you said, stable break. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll heal up easy on the trek.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;Sib. &nbsp;Be serious. &nbsp;You yourself said the terrain was treacherous. &nbsp;Deeper into the mountains, even more so. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t allow you to do something so dangerous. &nbsp;It would be an unforgivable foolishness to permit it. &nbsp;Not when&hellip; not when you&rsquo;re handicapped.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You know what he means. &nbsp;What he&rsquo;ll never say. &nbsp;What he can&rsquo;t say. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not when I&rsquo;m the one who did it.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve chosen your second well. &nbsp;Craglet he may be, Gustaf is a clever sod. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll be able to handle it. &nbsp;And don&rsquo;t worry about your quest. &nbsp;Even should the ancestors smile, everyone knows it would have been impossible to get this far without your keen skills. &nbsp;Chances are far better, however, that it will take far longer to scour those hills than for your arm to heal. Oh, but speaking of craglets&hellip; there is another reason it may be better for you to remain here, for now.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Well, that seems needlessly cryptic. &nbsp;Out with it.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">He grimaces.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c13 c19">&ldquo;I have it on fair authority that the &lsquo;cute&rsquo; First Among Scholars will be going to the Lowlander summer celebration this year. &nbsp;Chances are, he&rsquo;ll need a guide in order to get there and back alive&hellip; not that I would mind the alternative. &nbsp;Even with a broken arm, I have no doubt that&rsquo;s an endeavor you could perform blindfolded. &nbsp;Indeed, it may be preferable, so he does not bewitch you with his &lsquo;cuteness&rsquo;.&rdquo; </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You roll your eyes, and for emphasis, slug him in the arm. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s never going to let that one go. &nbsp;But then, a wicked grin sprouts on your face.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c19 c6 c31">&ldquo;Who says that he&rsquo;d be the one doing the bewitching, sib? &nbsp;After all, it will be just the two of us, in the lowlands, all alone. &nbsp;I understand that he&rsquo;s a fast learner&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Got him. &nbsp;It takes all of your exhausted will not to burst out laughing. </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">That look on his face will be a treasured memory.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<hr><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You take a quick moment to glance over the sheaf of papers. &nbsp;Oh, ancestors, yes. &nbsp;That look on his face will be a treasured memory.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You are once again </span><span class="c15 c38">The First</span><span class="c1">, and your meeting with Drivel is everything you imagined. &nbsp;In fact, to your pleasant surprise, it is everything you imagined, and more.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Quite frankly, you are </span><span class="c6 c10">impressed.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; When you appointed this panicking little shrew to the project, you figured he would be little more than a fresh steak before the eagles. &nbsp;But Ancestors condemn, he managed to pull a rabbit out of his ass! &nbsp;Far more distracting for those eagles.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Metaphor&rsquo;s getting away from you. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s back it up a bit.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">The papers you have been reading is one of the biggest, noxious, steaming piles of half-facts, suppositions, and complete ass-pulls you have ever read, and it is, in a word, </span><span class="c6 c10">brilliant.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Of course! There was nothing to find there&hellip; because they </span><span class="c6 c10">meant</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;for there to be nothing to find there! The entire project wasn&rsquo;t two seasons of wasted time, but instead, a shocking new revelation into not only the capabilities of these foul beings to mask their presence and cover their tracks, but also a glaring indictment of their character, revealing conclusively what dirty laundry could possibly be so embarrassing or contemptuous to </span><span class="c6 c10">them</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that they would spend so much time and effort scouring every trace of it from existence!<br>Never mind that the latter part mostly just confirms rumors that had been obtained from Aggro warriors more than a decade ago; now, there are &lsquo;hard&rsquo; &lsquo;facts&rsquo; to confirm it! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what really matters!</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">And, with all that in mind, it does put you into a bit of a conundrum. &nbsp;You had largely intended for this meeting to be a nice bit of stress relief, giving you an opportunity to pick apart all the ways he had failed to capitalize on the start you had given him; now that he had the audacity to actually </span><span class="c6 c10">have</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;something for you, it actually raises a question of whether or not he may actually be</span><span class="c6 c10">&nbsp;useful.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">This actually a fairly serious consideration! &nbsp;While there are certainly a number of your faculty that you cannot help but label &ldquo;Useful&rdquo;, the unfortunate fact is that many of them are old guard; they&rsquo;ve held their positions for centuries, are recognized experts in their studies, and nothing short of an avalanche was likely to shift their carcasses from their offices until the day they went to join the Ancestors. &nbsp;In short, they paid you lip service as their superior, but unless you were actively in front of them making their life a living hell, you couldn&rsquo;t trust them not to just fall back onto their own personal pet projects. &nbsp;So, while useful when used, using them was useless.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c10">Drivel</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;here, on the other hand, might not only be capable of the keen insight and out-of-the-bauxite thinking that you occasionally need from those stiffs, but he also has a healthy dose of respect and, more importantly, </span><span class="c6 c10">fear</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to properly motivate him! &nbsp;You had thought, yourself, that sometimes when put under pressure, underdogs like this will surprise you. &nbsp;Well, consider yourself totally flabbergasted. </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Hah. &nbsp;Sivens liked to use that word, and he would say it with </span><span class="c6 c10">total sincerity</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;Old tool.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hrm. &nbsp;Actually, thinking on, perhaps you are putting the cart before the ox. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s not get too excited, here.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">One fluke stroke of genius does not necessarily a useful tool make. &nbsp;Besides, it is possible that he plagiarized this work from the others, then blackmailed them into keeping hush&hellip; although you doubt it. &nbsp;He definitely doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the temperament for such skullduggery. &nbsp;But still, perhaps better to conduct another test. &nbsp;And you have just the thing in mind&hellip;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;Well, Drivel,&rdquo; </span><span class="c6">you shout, causing him to </span><span class="c6 c10">actually jump, how perfect is that</span><span class="c6">, </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;I must say that, although the evidence is thin, and the connecting logic a bit stretched in places, your hypotheses do seem to be quite reasonable. &nbsp;Indeed, I would say that they are currently the best explanation we have for what may have occurred up in that mountain. &nbsp;And not a moment too soon, either; a fair bit of buzz had emerged surrounding that curiosity after I returned, but this is sure to put everyone at ease&hellip; or, at least, more at ease.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c3">&ldquo;R-Really? &nbsp;Everyone really wants to know about the rituals?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">No. &nbsp;Absolutely not. &nbsp;While you did announce your &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; when you got back, in order to cover your tracks, it was met with a resounding complete lack of any response followed by grumbling about food.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;Of course! &nbsp;First tangible sign of hostile activity in decades? &nbsp;Who wouldn&rsquo;t be concerned? &nbsp;Thankfully, as I said, this should help to allay their fears; &nbsp;If these odd </span><span class="c23 c15">Animal Animal </span><span class="c4">hunters are only concerned with tracking their own kind, and take great pains to erase their presence, there&rsquo;s little reason to fear that they might target Eschaton. &nbsp;That would be at odds with their general modus of secrecy, after all.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c3">&ldquo;But&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t the fact that they have such capacity to remain undetected raise questions about whether or not they may actually be here in secret? &nbsp;Not to mention the fact that this proves that there are still&hellip; uh&hellip; that they&rsquo;re still operating in the area?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;Ah. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Well&hellip; while those are admittedly fair concerns, the great mitigating factor is that now that we </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for certain about them, we can take appropriate steps!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Huh. &nbsp;You get a weird feeling of deja vu there. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1"><br>In any case, that seems to satisfy him. &nbsp;You think. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s at least sweating a little less. Maybe.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Welp. &nbsp;Time to crank that up a few notches.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;Drivel, I do have to say&hellip; I am impressed. I knew I had a good feeling about you. &nbsp;Your staunch dedication to record-keeping is surely what allowed you to piece things together&hellip; and on top of that, you put in the footwork to find even more pieces together! It&rsquo;s like the old wisdom goes; Success is 9 parts preparation, one part perambulation. &nbsp;You have </span><span class="c6 c17 c10">tenacity</span><span class="c4">, Drivel.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6 c36">&ldquo;I do?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;You do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a vital virtue for any Bakshish.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or leads to a quick slide into insanity. &nbsp;Usually one or the other. &nbsp;More often one than the other.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I think you&rsquo;re the perfect Crag for another project I have coming up.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">His eyes widen. &nbsp;Ah, he&rsquo;s excited! Or terrified. &nbsp;Really, either will do.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;See, I&rsquo;m going to be&hellip; out of the office for some time early next season, but I&rsquo;d like to go ahead and get started on a project that is going to require careful monitoring for several months. &nbsp;Generally, it helps to &lsquo;grease the wheels&rsquo;, so to speak, if you can get someone to &lsquo;ride herd&rsquo;, so to speak, on the &lsquo;brain trust&rsquo;, so to speak.&ldquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I&hellip; see?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Ah, good, excellent. &nbsp;Now, this project, in particular, has to do with, and I know this is right up your alley,&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">-after all, what isn&rsquo;t with an absurdly broad study name like &lsquo;Lowland Esoterica&rsquo;-</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;, all the lowlander foliage that we bartered for nearly a year ago. &nbsp;While most of it is, of course, consumed, there is a fair number of seeds, stems, and other assorted germinates that remain. &nbsp;Thanks to the development of the new &ldquo;quartzhouses&rdquo;, as coined by the Onagi, we are capable of fine tuning an enclosed environment to suit a number of vegetative needs. &nbsp;Very soon, I intend to embark on a project to attempt to see if any of these Lowlander plants may actually be usable to further diversify our current spread of critical crops. &nbsp;As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware, there were a small number of varieties that were, sadly, lost during the Blight; as such, it behooves us to ensure that we can reinforce this variety wherever practicable.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ah. &nbsp;Okay. &nbsp;I think I understand.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Good Crag! Now, of course, these plants are going to require the utmost care and attention, as well as detailed record keeping, in order to ensure that we learn as much as possible about them, how they grow, how they thrive, and in what ways we might be able to utilize them. &nbsp;While I of course trust the various members of our faculty, particularly in the Head of the Study of Herbalism who will be frontmost on this project,&rdquo; </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">-That is, supposing she doesn&rsquo;t spend all her time sampling her own product, like she&rsquo;s been doing for the past, oh, three decades- </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;, it will of course work to everyone&rsquo;s best interests to keep close tabs on her and her department, double check their work, and ensure that all data are being carefully kept and logged. &nbsp;And, of course, any extrapolations or theories we create ourselves along the way just add to the collective knowledge, right?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c3">&ldquo;R-Right.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6 c17">&ldquo;And so, what I&rsquo;d like </span><span class="c6 c10 c17">you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to do, Drivel, is to &ldquo;tag along&rdquo;, so to speak, as I perform these duties during the early stages of the project, and then when I have to be absent, just make sure that all the things I&rsquo;d do are seen to, all the proper people motivated, and just to generally ensure that everything remains on-task. &nbsp;Sound reasonable?&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c6 c36">&ldquo;Sure? &nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c10 c36">I-I mean</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;yes! Of course, First Among Scholars!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Excellent! Feel free to take off, now. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll contact you in the morning, and we can get started.&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2 c16"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Yes, First! Thank you for this opportunity! I won&rsquo;t disappoint you! I- I mean I&rsquo;ll make sure my work is o-of the highest quality!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I expect nothing less!&rdquo;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The door to your office closes, with a little more force than is necessary.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">ANCESTORS, is that refreshing. &nbsp;That nervousness. &nbsp;That desire to impress. &nbsp;That </span><span class="c6 c10">respect</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;More than likely also tinged with loathing and jealousy, but hey, you&rsquo;d probably be suspicious if it wasn&rsquo;t.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">The project itself, of course, is mostly a smoke screen. &nbsp;The real important work is being done, right here, in this room, as you work day and night </span><span class="c6 c10">regardless of what that ridiculous crone might say</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;to collate all traits and bloodlines of Eschaton, just to see if there is any </span><span class="c6 c10">possible</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;way that you might be able to plan a miracle. &nbsp;Sadly, for all your prowess, you are not the Ancestors; if you had </span><span class="c6 c10">The Tome</span><span class="c1">, it might be a different story, but&hellip; well, people in hell want iced water.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">However, speaking of hells, while the Vegetation Enrichment project was intended to be a smokescreen, there&rsquo;s no reason it can&rsquo;t also serve as Drivel&rsquo;s new personal hell. &nbsp;Probably, for the first couple days, you&rsquo;ll actually oversee the initial steps of the project, but afterwards, </span><span class="c6 c10">urgent business</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will rear its ugly head, and he&rsquo;ll need to effectively take over the project wholesale. &nbsp;If he flubs it, well, no huge loss; you&rsquo;ve checked yourself, and while losing those strains of crop was sad, they in and of themselves did not account for any irreplaceable nutrition requirements. &nbsp;But if he should manage to rise above&hellip; Hrm. &nbsp;Actually, if he manages to rise above, you may need to carefully consider your move after that. &nbsp;It wouldn&rsquo;t do to mock Sivens while simultaneously repeating all of his greatest mistakes. &nbsp;Speaking of&hellip; </span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You find yourself eyeing your desk drawer. &nbsp;The lock on it, newly installed, glints softly; it&rsquo;s made of actual iron, promised to be sturdier than the desk that surrounds it. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6"><br>Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to have another dose today. &nbsp;After all, this morning was </span><span class="c6 c10">particularly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;shitty. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">...Although, if you are going to go on this trip, perhaps it would be best to moderate your use. &nbsp;After all, if there&rsquo;s one place you don&rsquo;t want to be getting too relaxed, it&rsquo;s in the Lowlands. &nbsp;There are </span><span class="c6 c10">bears</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;down there, after all. &nbsp;And </span><span class="c6 c10">sharks!</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1"><br>Oh. &nbsp;You pulled out the key already. &nbsp;Curious.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...No. &nbsp;Not today. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve still got several more genotypes to sort through.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Okay, fuck it, yes today. &nbsp;You earned it, and then some. &nbsp;No one would judge you for indulging after </span><span class="c6 c10">that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;shitshow. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sticky liquid slams into the back of your throat.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Time to make this morning </span><span class="c6 c10">go away.</span></p> 
<hr><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">You are </span><span class="c15 c38">Drivel.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;d probably just lay down a line of A&rsquo;s, but you try not to repeat yourself like that, because you&rsquo;re not a hack. &nbsp;Instead, you take this opportunity to reflect on the ups and downs today has brought. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...Ok, maybe not. &nbsp;You guess you&rsquo;re actually pretty bad at introspection. &nbsp;Problem solving, sure. &nbsp;Piecing things together, fugedahboutit. &nbsp;But trying to get all analytical with your own thoughts&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s like lifting yourself up by your bootstraps. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t really do anything; It&rsquo;s just kind of dumb.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You are pretty good at panicking, though. &nbsp;Today provided plenty of fodder for that.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">There is one other thing you&rsquo;re good at, that helps with the panic, most of the time. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...Maybe there&rsquo;s time to do it now. &nbsp;After all, you&rsquo;re pretty sure no one is expecting you back at Esoterica. &nbsp;Probably, apart from The First, no one is expecting you to show up to anything ever again.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You reach for your bottom cabinet drawer, pulling it open. &nbsp;There it is. &nbsp;The key to your stress relief.</span></p> 
<p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">...Okay, yeah, we&rsquo;re doing it now.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">With one practiced motion, you remove your tunic. &nbsp;No sense in getting it sweaty.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Gently, you lift the heavy chunk of iron from your drawer. &nbsp;You place yourself in the correct position; sitting on your bed, elbow on your knee, your forearm extended, handle grasped firmly.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You begin. &nbsp; One. &nbsp;Two. &nbsp;Three. &nbsp;Four. &nbsp;Five. Six. Seven. Eight. &nbsp;Nine. Ten.</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">With each count, you feel muscle flex, sinew sing. &nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Time to make this morning </span><span class="c22 c34 c6 c10">go away.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c19 c6 c40 c47">A chill wind floats through your drafty room. &nbsp;It promises Gains.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c19 c32">ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc</span></p> 
<h2 class="c30 c16" id="h.fiqin74ms7de"><span class="c19 c15 c28">Skill Usage</span></h2><p class="c18 c16"><span class="c15">Economic</span><span>: </span><span class="c21 c22 c10">Eschaton lies stark. &nbsp;Barren. &nbsp;The great ruins which had towered over all are now reduced to mere heaps of rubble and gravel. &nbsp;And yet, while they may no longer retain the fallen shapes they once had, the history of Eschaton still lives within these heaps. And its future.<br>No stone is wasted, no cobble discarded. &nbsp;Through vast application of will, what was once useless dross can be reformed, reshaped, recast into useable form once more, slab after slab of new, polished, usable stone emerging from what was once useless. &nbsp;Such a feat of will, on such a scale, has not been seen within living memory; and yet, it is through harnessing the will of all Crag- foremost, Onagi, Elpahka, and especially Samra- that the Layer sees her plans take shape.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c21 c10 c22">Though now stripped bare, Eschaton must regrow from the ground up. &nbsp;Plans have been laid. &nbsp;New structures designed. &nbsp;Old designs modernized. &nbsp;Designs modern, structured. &nbsp;As in any construction effort, the plan comes first. &nbsp;Then, the Foundation.<br>Slabal has placed careful thought into what must be done first, what is most fundamental. &nbsp;This winter, that truth was brought into sharp relief. &nbsp;There is no doubt. &nbsp;First and foremost, Eschaton must attend to the needs of its many. &nbsp;The extractors, the farmers, the tenders, the haulers. &nbsp;For if these fundamental elements of Crag culture are strong, the Crag are strong&hellip; if they are weak?<br>The Crag collapse.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span>Attempting to use the </span><span class="c15">Infrastructure(Investment) </span><span>Skill to add the aspect </span><span class="c10">Cast the First Stone: Physiological </span><span>to Eschaton. &nbsp;Capitalizing on the goodwill and renewed strength of the Samra, it is during this critical phase they may best contribute to Eschaton&rsquo;s future, providing an Upgrade to the check. &nbsp;However, the Onagi are still pained from the untold destruction that they, themselves, were forced to visit upon Eschaton. &nbsp;Their pained souls provide a Setback Die. &nbsp;Ultimately, Slabal recognizes that the Foundation of this new Eschaton is the single most important step; in spite of the Onagi&rsquo;s pain, she can allow no lapses at this critical juncture. &nbsp;If need be, she will throw her all into this; &nbsp;After all, while this is their future, the very stones they use are a connection to the past the Onagi grieve over. &nbsp;Through this reminder, and tireless dilligence, she will spend a fate point to </span><span class="c15">Invoke </span><span class="c10">Our Legacy is Set in Stone,</span><span class="c21 c19">&nbsp;providing another upgrade.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c15">Political</span><span>: </span><span class="c10">The great endeavors of the Onagi and Samra have not escaped the attention of the Elpahka. &nbsp;While it is not in their purview, not their responsibility, to understand the crafts, to know the labors, it is the considered view of many that idle aid is&hellip; insufficient, in these difficult times. &nbsp;As with all their Crag kin, the Elpahka have felt keenly the consequences of complacency; where in times past, they would have coached a mantra of &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rsquo;, such wisdom rings hollow when any succor, any assistance they could provide now may have great returns for the wellbeing of the Crag. &nbsp;And so, in their own way, they will seek to aid these endeavors, in the way the Elpahka best know how.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span>Attempting to use the </span><span class="c15">Recovery(Rebuilding)</span><span class="c21 c19">&nbsp;Skill to take 0 points of stress from the Property track, and place it on the Economy track, additionally removing 0 points of stress in the process. &nbsp;This best represents the efforts of the Elpahka to aid the workers of Eschaton; whether they will be successful is curiously uncharted waters.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c15">Military: </span><span class="c10">Having rotated their spent numbers for fresh, and resupplied, Embebi&rsquo;s Stalkers once again set out, this time heading directly North, blazing the trail towards their best lead yet. &nbsp;To their curiosity, however, Embebi is not among them; instead, she has placed her Second, Gustaf, in charge. &nbsp;Curiouser still is an unexpected tagalong; Echo of Blood, and a quartet of his most skilled Euclast, accompany the expedition. &nbsp;Mindful of the dangers ahead, and secretly uncertain of the strain this escort will place on their efforts, Gustaf discretely outlines a search pattern more modest than previously intended; better to be safe, than sorrowful.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span>Attempting to use the </span><span class="c15">Reconnaissance(</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">Pathfinders)</span><span>&nbsp;Skill to chart the a single square of territory (Currently highlighted). The going may be slow, but that may be all the better; every Stalker present is more than keen to see Embebi return before they embark upon </span><span class="c10">truly</span><span>&nbsp;dangerous terrain. &nbsp;However, as the land is still mountainous, the stunt </span><span class="c10">The Stone is our Home</span><span class="c21 c19">&nbsp;applies once more, providing a boost die.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c15">Mental:</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;While largely inconsequential compared to the now </span><span>extra</span><span class="c21 c22 c10">&nbsp;secret research the First is conducting on his own regarding Eschaton&rsquo;s lack of distinctiveness, &nbsp;the Vegetation Enrichment project serves its purpose well, acting as a lightning rod to attract all the learned opinions, and criticisms, of several now-competing studies. &nbsp;According to the Lowland Esoterica Head, there is little sense that Horticulture should lead the project, as the vegetation in question is of Low Origin; Likewise, the Head of the Study of Geographic Principles insists that mere knowledge of plants pales in comparison to understanding the conditions those plants require. &nbsp;As more and more are drawn into the discussion/turmoil, Drivel finds himself abandoned in the middle of Seniority. &nbsp;Time will tell whether he will sink or swim.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span>Attempting to use the </span><span class="c15">Mysticism</span><span>[as the nature of the conversation does largely revolve around, well, nature, falling under the blanket of more druidic principles] </span><span class="c15">(Creation)</span><span>&nbsp;Skill to create the technology </span><span class="c10">Lowland Strains&lt;Protatotype&gt;</span><span class="c21 c19">. &nbsp;If successful, the cultivation of Lowland vegetation adapted to survive within the quartzhouses could serve as an essential stepping stone to adapting these curious crops to surviving in the high altitude climes in which the Crag reside. &nbsp;Treading in the paths the Ancestors walked when they first arrived, the excitement this project brings(retreading lore, making something that has a lasting impact, is food related) is unfortunately checked by all the internecine struggle it encourages(who should be in charge, which plants to prioritize, what is the actual experimental procedure here anyway). &nbsp;As such, in spite of such fervor, only their basic competency at the subject remains.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16 c5"><span class="c21 c19"></span></p> 
<p class="c16 c18"><span class="c19 c34 c15 c35">End of Turn </span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c19 c39 c15 c49">Results-</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c24 c15">Economic- </span><span class="c11">Success! Slabal&rsquo;s steady and well-paced attitude has placed the Aspect </span><span class="c10 c45">Cast the First Stone: Physiological </span><span class="c26 c19">to Eschaton! While the Onagi were in low spirits, the enthusiasm of the Samra helping them is a welcome counter. Having seen firsthand the suffering of the Samra in recent times, the Samra&rsquo;s dedication to helping the Onagi and gratefulness for the effort slowly lift the Onagi&#39;s spirits.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c19 c26"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c26 c19">In the end, Slabal&#39;s plans go off without a hitch. Eschaton may not be a towering glorious work of art, but it is finally a functional, healthy town once again. It may not have the sheer majesty of the old temples, but Slabal has found ways to make even simple architecture honor the Ancestors. The stability of baserock provides confidence to all Crag, and Slabal is set firm with the knowledge that she is not done yet.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c24 c15">Political- </span><span class="c11">The lessons that the Elpahka have learned are applied in new ways. They have no desire for lax attention to cause a repeat of the suffering endured during the blight. They orient themselves towards fulfilling the needs of their people </span><span class="c11 c10">before </span><span class="c9">they become critical.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c11">This season seems to be a little bit of a dry run for that. The Elpahka are perhaps a bit to enthusiastic at first. When the Elpahka come down just to ask if everything is okay </span><span class="c11 c10">daily</span><span class="c9">, many Crag start to suspect that something is secretly wrong. This unsettles confidence at first, but the Elpahka get the idea before anything serious goes down.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c11">Overall the extra attentiveness does actually prove helpful, if only a little. The Samra and Onagi push themselves greatly to achieve their goals, and while the Elpahka are not useful in directly assisting in this task they </span><span class="c11 c10">are</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;useful in assisting the Onagi and Samra.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c9">Ever willing to prove themselves past their perceived failings last season, the Onagi push themselves a bit far. Despite Slabal&rsquo;s calm leadership, many of the Onagi push themselves day and night to meet unrealistic expectations that they themselves set. Guilt for having wiped clean so much history pushed them to exceed their limits, and not in a good way.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c9">The leadership and guidance of the Elpahka brings them back to the path. There is no need to prove themselves, no mistakes to make up for. They trust in the faithfulness of the Onagi, and help them return to trusting themselves. It&rsquo;s a good thing too, as pushing themselves too hard may have resulted in an accident.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c9">(While the Recovery check technically didn&rsquo;t succeed and would not have stopped any fresh Stress, you didn&rsquo;t suffer any new Stress this turn. Instead, some of that sweet sweet Advantage the Elpahka rolled go towards countering some of the Threat that the Onagi rolled, balancing it out. Nice!)</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c19 c24 c15 c40"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c24 c15">Military-</span><span class="c9">&nbsp; It seems that Gustaf is no replacement for Embebi, and neither is Echo for that matter. Thankfully, Gustaf&rsquo;s decision to keep the scope limited was a wise one. It seems that the winter was nearly as hard on the mountains themselves as it was on the Crag. Areas that were passable and safe last season are now unstable rock piles. Canyons and passes that were once quite traversable have filled with rockslides. All of your maps need to be updated.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c11">In the end it goes better than the last few of Echo&rsquo;s outings, actually. No Crag are killed. However, it takes nearly the entire season to </span><span class="c11 c10">get to</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;the territory marked on the map, much less actually get to exploring it. Most of the Stalkers&rsquo; efforts go to updating the maps after the winter&rsquo;s effects on the mountains and to traversing the changed terrain safely.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c9">By the time the Stalkers reach the designated area, they barely have time to make camp before returning to Eschaton. While there is likely some argument on Echo&rsquo;s part, staying out longer than planned is dangerous to any Crag and even Echo cannot fight the mountains themselves. They are forced to return.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c24 c15">Mental- </span><span class="c11">Okay, like, going on your own mental obstacle course over a single problem with a reasonably well defined goal is one thing. This is, well, this is </span><span class="c11 c10">completely different.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;Poor Drivel just gets no respect, no respect at all. That is, of course, the central problem. No matter how hard he tries, Drivel just gets talked over constantly. It takes him weeks - oh shit, no, </span><span class="c11 c10">months </span><span class="c9">- of trying to cram a word in edgewise to the constantly arguing Bakshish before he realizes he needs to change tactics.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c9">Drivel decides to play to his strengths, which is mostly pattern recognition and balancing charts and stuff. Which means he stops trying to win by force of personality and starts trying to win by clever seating arrangements and meeting schedules, putting the people he wants to work together near each other and the people who tend to clash far apart.</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c9">And&hellip; it&hellip; actually starts working?</span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p> 
<p class="c20 c16"><span class="c11">Not perfectly, and it&rsquo;s a bit late by the time he figures this out. At any rate, by managing the discourse with bureaucracy and minutiae, he actually gets the Bakshish talking about solving problems, rather than trying to figure out which one of them </span><span class="c11 c10">is</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;the problem. Drivels efforts at least get everyone lined up on the starting line. You will have a </span><span class="c15 c24">boost die</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;on your next Creation attempt at this problem, assuming Drivel is still in charge.. </span></p>

<h2 class="c30 c16" id="h.7qk199eoip"><span class="c19 c28 c15">Developments</span></h2><p class="c18 c16"><span class="c15 c10">The Next Generation</span><span><br></span><span class="c10">The Crag, by longstanding preference, do not commit to actions quickly or with undue haste. &nbsp;Though to many, the progress that has been made towards the Esteemed&rsquo;s decree may seem distressingly anemic, to the Crag this progress has been conducted with praiseworthy speed&hellip; although few would be quite</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c21 c22 c10">so enthusiastic were they to know the glaring problem which still taints this endeavor.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c21 c19">Though not a full year has passed, the advent of a new one seems an appropriate place to take stock of the progress made. &nbsp;To wit:</span></p> 
<ol class="c25 lst-kix_7l53okosqxwh-0 start" start="1"><li class="c14"><span class="c21 c19">Though Eschaton has not yet grown, the progress the Onagi are making to ensure that said growth is handled with utmost care is underway. &nbsp;Although the changes have been radical, it is easy to see that the future is in cautious hands; a comforting thought.</span></li><li class="c14"><span class="c10">All is well</span><span class="c21 c19">. &nbsp;Though not free from hardship, the people of Eschaton, and it&rsquo;s new outlying outpost, are finally beginning to recover, although it waits to be seen whether this reprieve is temporary, or long enough to achieve this goal.</span></li><li class="c14"><span class="c21 c19">No outside sources of food have been positively established, but plans are in motion. &nbsp;Slabal is playing this one close to the chest.</span></li><li class="c14"><span class="c17 c15">ENDANGERED</span><span class="c15">.</span><span>&nbsp; A curse long waiting to express, the Extermination stole the future of the Crag in more ways than one. &nbsp;The efforts to compile the traits of the Crag were successful, but paint a dire picture. &nbsp;Now, to complete this objective, a fateful decision must be made; see </span><span class="c10">The Origin of the Future</span><span class="c21 c19">, a new development, below.</span></li></ol><p class="c18 c16"><span class="c22 c34 c15 c35 c10">Who Shall Go Forth</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c10">Though their abilities were called into question, none can deny the achievements of the Stalkers this year; in comparison, the First&rsquo;s own discoveries, while praiseworthy(at least, according to him), seem much more meager in comparison. &nbsp;Indeed, with other issues occupying his attention, he has dropped interest in this argument entirely&hellip; at least, for now.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c21 c19">In recognition of the Stalkers&rsquo; findings and their drive to complete their assigned task, it is clear that the Aggro should and shall retain the Responsibility of Going Forth. &nbsp;To represent this affirmation of their responsibilities, the Aggro receive the Skill point to invest into the Military spectrum. &nbsp;Their choice is clearcut; more than anything, the Aggro have learned that knowledge is potency, and may well be half of an engagement. </span></p> 
<h2 class="c16 c30" id="h.sm9y8az80w8w"><span class="c19 c28 c15">New Developments</span></h2><p class="c18 c16"><span class="c15 c10">The Origin of the Future</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c10">In a manner all too ironically similar to their crops, the Crag find themselves plighted by their ancestor&rsquo;s careful cultivation of traits. &nbsp;Now, woefully bereft of the Diversity they need, the Crag leadership, who must work in secret to avoid a panic, will need to endeavor to find a way to avert this disastrous bottleneck.</span></p> 
<p class="c18 c16"><span class="c21 c19">The options below list the most likely sources of solution, although others may present themselves in the future. &nbsp;Needless to say, any progress that a leader may make towards one of these solutions will contribute to which facet of the Crag deserve development.</span></p> 
<ol class="c25 lst-kix_jghjhjqs0b57-0 start" start="1"><li class="c14"><span class="c10">Our Wayward Kin</span><span class="c21 c19">: It has become clear that many of the other settlements were not completely Exterminated; survivors and refugees still live, scraping by in hostile environs. &nbsp;It is possible that their distinctiveness holds the key.</span></li><li class="c14"><span class="c10">The Lowland Ilk:</span><span class="c21 c19">&nbsp;Though separated for many centuries, Crag are still elves, as are all the myriad forms that populate the lowlands. &nbsp; While immediately available, the result of such incorporation, and exactly how to enact it, are currently pending research.</span></li><li class="c14"><span class="c10">A Future Concern</span><span class="c21 c19">: Though ultimately damning, there is always the First&rsquo;s first suggestion; it is possible, through careful pairing, to avoid significant expression of undesired traits in The Next Generation; the problem lies further ahead. &nbsp;Should no other objective be complete, this must be the default solution, as unpalatable as it is.</span></li><li class="c14"><span>???</span></li></ol><div><p class="c0"><span class="c21 c19"></span></p>
