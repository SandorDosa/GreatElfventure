<p>  </p> 
<p>A killing wind cuts across the mountainside.   With each gust and buffet, you can feel your life waning, draining, failing.  Already, your hands have lost all sensation; yet, you do not need to feel to know the somber truth.  Your grip is slipping.  The abyss plunges beneath you.  The ledge, safety, hangs a mere few armlengths above you, but it may as well be a hundred for all the difference it makes.</p>
<p>You are <b>Padeck.</b>  </p>
<p>And you are about to die.  </p>
<p>It is a solemn fact, but it is one that you have come to terms with.  It is your punishment for your hubris.  For seeking that beyond your abilities.  For allowing your excitement to outweigh your prudence.</p>
<p>When you had heard that the Stalker Alpha, Embebi, had made an impassioned plea for those with survival experience to join the ranks of her Stalkers, you had responded with a haste that surprised even yourself.  In your mind, you had many noble justifications; It was by her actions that you and your kin had been returned to the fold of the Crag, to none other than Eschaton herself, somehow still standing in the wake of the Extermination.  She saved you from the depredations of the Lowlands, of all the muck and suffering there.  To repay that rescue, you could do no less but answer her call.  Honorable intentions, all.</p>
<p>Of course, now, in your final moments, you can be honest with yourself, if nothing else.  To repay her great boon to you was only one of your motivations.  A stronger one, a <i>foolish</i> one, took far greater priority in your heart.  You did not merely seek repayment.  You sought <i>obsession.</i></p>
<p>In a time so distant you can scarcely recall it, your lineage marked you as Samra, durable, dutiful, diligent.  You toiled, you feasted, you acted in communion with the others of your lineage.  It was a simple life, but satisfying, in its way. </p>
<p>The Extermination changed it all.  Tore that life away.  Replaced it with one of fear, of pain, of confusion, of agony.  In spite of it all, you survived, and with each passing day, you grew inured to the fresh horrors that those maddened lands would vomit forth.  You became more than inured.  You became fascinated.  Obsessed.  Your return to your people seemed a brilliant thing, at first, but it did not take long before your senses, ruined by years of sensory saturation, begun to dig at your mind.  Counter to all sensibility, you began to crave the same experiences that had tortured you for so long.  And so, to be presented an opportunity, you took it, without any thought for the rightness of it.</p>
<p>It is not an unheard of thing for one of the Samra to prove themselves worthy of being an Aggro.  Every generation, dozens of youths undertake Rites of Placement to show where their true capabilities lie.  Even at later ages, the Rite can be undertaken, but it is only the greatest, the most worthy, who can master themselves to such a degree as to revert the fate that lays in their very blood.</p>
<p>As evidenced by your impending end, you are not the greatest.  You are not the most worthy.  You are a foolish Samra, plagued by a sick mind, driven to silent madness by years of mental torture.  Perhaps, all things considered, it is not a terrible thing that this is to be your end.  </p>

<p>Even though all sensation is lost, you can tell that the sleet, driven fast, faster now, by the killing wind, is chipping away at the death grip you have upon the cliff face.  It stung your eyes, forcing you to close them.  A foolish error.   The stinging wind has frozen them shut.  You doubt you will ever open them again.  You hang in empty space; senseless, visionless, the only thing left to you is the sound of the gale that will end you.  It is peaceful, in a way.  </p>
<p>Embebi.  Swift Embebi.  Unbound Embebi.  You owed her your life.  Now, you owe her your death.  She did not see your weakness, did not turn you away.  She encouraged you.  <i>Coddled</i> you.  Let you continue your attempts to prove yourself, in spite of numerous failures.  Now, placed through a real trial, headed by the Greatest of the Aggro, the Echo of Blood, your weakness is conclusively laid bare.  </p>
<p>It all began so simply.  Pathfinding, trekking, climbing, not within the safe reaches of Eschaton, but in the untamed, wild crags near Eparchy.  With winter conditions, it was supposed to test you, prepare you for the treacherous terrains that the Real Stalkers had been enduring for months.  </p>
<p>Today, you prove how great a gulf lies between your abilities and theirs.  You did not forsee the blizzard.  Did not see the uneven ground, covered by freshly fallen snow.  You failed to secure yourself properly, and so tumbled headlong into the abyss.  Sheer instinct halted your fall, scrabbling into the frozen cliffside.  But instinct alone will not save you from the ultimate conclusion.</p>
<p>The conclusion.  It is coming.  Your final sensation, the wind, is failing.  Your mind is fading.  When it is gone, so will be your grip.  So will be your life.</p>
<p>You do not resent it.  It is the fate you made for yourself.  Now, it is your duty to embrace it.</p>

<p><i>AH</i></p>

<p>You had thought all sensation driven from your body, but the pain that blossoms in your arm corrects you.  You can feel the bones there grinding against eachother, a pain that overwhelms even the biting rawness that is your skin.</p>
<p>Fire blossoms on the palms of your hands.  You feel yourself wrenched, dangling, adrift in the abyss.</p>

<p>One of the gifts of the Ancestors, the birthright of all Crag, is the ability to endure suffering beyond that which a normal creature can endure.</p>
<p>What you are currently feeling is roughly a dozen times beyond even that.</p>
<p>Darkness claims you.  An unworthy end.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, darkness then releases you.  So gingerly does it release its claws that it takes you a long stretch of time to realize that you are realizing things.  The first thing you ultimately realize is that pain has become your world.</p>
<p>Yet, in that world are curious features.  Noises.  <i>Words</i>, your mind ultimately realizes.</p>

<p id="Echo">“...ging there, barely.  Just as I reached him, his grip gave way.  I managed to catch him, but it seems I gripped too tightly.”</p>

<p id="Gustaf">“A broken arm is far less than the least of his injuries if you missed.  Honestly, Echo of Blood, I am somewhat amazed you found him.  An impressive feat, in this blizzard, but I must again urge you to rest on your laurels.  Even <i>you</i> could be lost in a gale like this.”</p>

<p id="Echo">“... There are still more missing, Gustaf.  I must find them.  I am the reason they are here.  I am the reason they are lost.”</p>
<p id="Gustaf">“... As I mentioned, this storm is no fault of yours, Chief Among Aggro.  Even I did not forsee it.  Please, be reasonable.  If you-”</p>

<p>A low growl cuts through the air.  You didn’t think you could become any more chilled.</p>

<p id="Echo">“I have had about my fill of <i>reason</i> this day, Gustaf.  No one, not you or any other, will stop me from using every ounce of my ability as I see fit.  If you wish for reason, then see to this one’s injuries, and prepare more frostsalve.  I will return with more <i>soon</i>.”</p>

<p>No response is given.  The biting gale, once absent, returns for a brief, searing moment, before disappearing once more. As the moist air hits your lungs, you hack, bringing up a gobbet of mucus.</p>

<p>Footsteps approach.  You hear one of the voices, closer, much closer now.</p>
<p id="Gustaf">“Well.  Still some life left in you, then.  Congratulations.  You’re probably one of the luckiest Crag I know.  Or, unluckiest, depends on who you ask.”</p>

<p>You try to find words of your own, but you can do scarcely more than moan and mumble; you haven’t the strength for any more. </p>

<p id="Gustaf">“Well said.  Anyways, ask me, and I’d actually rank you an unlucky one.  Oh, sure, thanks to this salve here…” You hear a mushy sound, like a wet fart.  “I figure you’ll probably live, maybe even keeping better than half your hide in the process.  Problem is… what you’re about to experience…”</p>

<p>You feel a distant sensation, a rubbing, on your leg, and not long after, it begins to tiiiIIIIIAAAAA<i>AAAHHHHHH<b>HHRRRRGHHH</b></i></p>

<p id="Gustaf">“..you’ll probably think maybe death wouldn't have been so bad.”</p>
<hr>
<p>You hold the glowstone to the page with trembling hands.  You grit your teeth, both in frustration, and to keep them from clacking.  Crag are hearty people, blessed with the gifts of their Ancestors, the fruits of the Path… but there isn’t anything that can help <i>oxshit</i> cold like this.  </p>
<p>As you draw your robes tighter around yourself, trying to maintain your composure, you are also reminded that being scrawny probably doesn’t help.  However, progress waits for no Crag, and ridiculous temperatures or not, you are <i>determined</i> to stay on task.</p>

<p>Besides, it wouldn’t be seemly for you, <b>The First Among Scholars</b>, to do any less than your subordinates just because it’s cold… especially when said subordinate is sitting right across from you, acting like this frigid air is nothing more than a mild inconvenience.  Then again, Drivel is probably a little more stout than you… not only is he older than you (although you don’t care to dwell on that much), but you’ve always suspected that there’s more than a small hint of a stockier bloodline in his lineage… probably Samra, if you had to guess by his abilities.</p>

<p>Then again… perhaps you should reconsider exactly how capable he is.  Even through the cold, you can see that the document in front of you is meticulously researched and finely detailed, a stunning work of penselfship.  Even if the conclusion is… somewhat predictable.  What divine entity can best help a civilization of elves?  Well, why not the explicit god of elves!</p>

<p>Of course, it’s always important to remember that just because an answer appears to be easy doesn’t <i>necessarily</i> mean that it’s wrong.  While reality is daunting in it’s confusing panoply of hidden causes and mysterious effects, sometimes you manage to catch a break.  Besides, any suspicion that the result is due to lazy thinking is dashed by the sheer <i>volume</i> of justifications for the simple answer… which probably means he also <i>anticipated</i> your default impression.  That fact impresses, and concerns, you in equal measure.  <i>He knows what you want to hear.</i>  Err, read.  </p>

<p>You wonder for a moment about how to handle that fact, but ultimately, your instinct takes over; after all, you <i>like</i> being told what you want to hear.</p>

<p id="First">“Thorough work as ever, Drivel.  I can see the diligence you put into this, even if the ultimate conclusion was somewhat foregone.  It’s the true mark of the dedicated scholar to be willing to confront your own preconceptions, put them to the test, and ensure that the obvious is, in fact, obvious.  Well done!”</p>

<p>Quite frankly, there’s a lot less exaggeration in your assertions than you’d prefer.  It <i>is</i> well done.  And, in fact, timely.  You <i>very specifically avoid</i> looking at the locked desk drawer that currently contains the most sensitive elements of your current… heritage studies… and instead just stare through Drivel as you reflect on the difficulties you’ve had recently in making heads or ends of it.  Every step forward seems to put two more steps ahead of you, and through it all, you simply cannot shake the feeling that there is something <i>fundamental</i> that you are missing, some central element needed to tie it all together.</p>

<p>While you don’t think that his work has that missing element <i>per se</i>, you have a suspicion that it may have the simplest, fastest path towards it.</p>

<p>Oh, shoot, he said something, and seems to be awaiting a response.  Focus, Renyan.  Well, it doesn’t matter what he said.  The next step is obvious.</p>

<p id="First">“Indeed.  And so, as promised, work of such high quality certainly must come from a Scholar of higher standing.  Congratulations, Scholar Savant Drivel! I will make sure your Head is suitably informed of your new position, and all that you have done to earn it.  Indeed, keep it up, and you may well be sitting in <i>their</i> position within the decade!”</p>

<p>His eyes go wide at that.  Good, you can still surprise him.</p>

<p id="Drivel">“…T-Thank you, First Among Scholars.  Um.  And thank you for the opportunity to advance myself in this fashion.  I do not think I’d be here without your guidance.”</p>

<p>...<i>Uh</i>-oh.  That’s new.  He’s <i>toadying.</i></p>
<p>Of course, in and of itself, you can appreciate that… never hurts to have a couple toadys, and in spite of your position you’ve always found yourself short in that department… but what concerns you is that it means that Drivel feels comfortable enough around you <i>to</i> Toady, rather than his typical default state of Snivelling.  While nearly identical to an outsider, a lifetime’s worth of experience in the Academic Battle Royale that is the Bakshish to identify the clear difference between Snivelling, Toadying, Weaseling, Bandying, and, most worrisome of all, <i>Cronying</i>.  While he’s definitely no where near that worrisome state yet, the fact that he’s advancing up the ladder at all makes you concerned.</p>

<p>If your concern showed at all, either he didn’t spot it, or, more concerningly, he knew not to let on that he spotted it, as he then continues on from there.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“...So… what should I be doing next?  I-I mean, is that sufficiently detailed, or should I continue along those lines, or is there another branch I could investigate to h-help you ou- uh, to aid in your endeavors?”</p>

<p>Internally, you make a teeth-sucking sound.  And he’s taking Initiative.  Yikes.</p>
<p>...Well, as part of your deliberations on how to handle Drivel’s continual evidence of competence, you figure now is as good a time as any to put a quick obstacle in his path.  You paint a smile on your face, trying to make it as genuine as you can possibly fabricate.</p>

<p id="First">“Ah, Drivel… <i>Scholar Savant</i> Drivel… the next step for you is to <i>celebrate</i>.  This is a significant achievement!  And, quite frankly, ever since you’ve begun aiding me in my endeavors, you have scarcely had a moment’s rest.  While <i>I</i> am quite accustomed to this workload, I sometimes neglect the impact such constant labor can have on one’s mental well being.  It wouldn’t do for an asset such as yourself to <i>burn out</i>.  So, until further notice, I release you to operate on your own recognizance.  Take some time off! Relax, and let yourself unravel!”</p>

<p><i>Unravel</i> may be right.  So far, Drivel has performed astonishingly well under pressure… so, let’s see what happens when that pressure is suddenly removed.  It’s not that you want him to come <i>completely</i> apart at the seams… at this point you must admit, he has become a valuable asset… but hopefully, this will allow you to tune the <i>correct</i> amount of pressure to put him under so that he <i>remains</i> an asset… and not a threat.</p>

<p>...Hrm.  That’s odd.  Usually, you consider yourself quite capable of reading other Crag, but that expression on his face puzzles you.  <i>Wistful</i>, you might call it.  But why?</p>

<p id="Drivel">“...Uhm… if that’s what you want, First Among Scholars, then… would it be acceptable for me to return to Eparchy?  I had a few loose ends in my project there… N-not that I want to disregard your advice on overwork!  B-But… I’d just feel much more, er, at peace, I guess, if I knew that those were handled.  Uhm.  If that’s alright.”</p>

<p><i>Uh oh.</i></p>
<p>You weren’t expecting that response.  That, alone, is reason to be concerned… actually, you’re using that word too often.  Let’s call it more… <i>uneasy</i>, that’s a little more accurate.  After all, it’s not like Drivel is actually a conc- moving on.  More than just being unexpected, the fact that, when presented an opportunity to take a break, he instead wants to return to the unsupervised projects he was working on… Well, that sounds suspiciously like said projects could be secretly intended to further his position among the Heads currently stationed there.  What <i>is</i> it that he was doing there?  The dirt, likely, but why would he be eager to return to that dead end project, regardless of its success? Would he…</p>

<p><i>You may need to be a little concerned about how paranoid you can get.</i></p>

<p>That thought arises, unbidden, from somewhere deep in your cortex.  Unbidden or not, it’s timely.  </p>
<p>...Okay, Renyan, think about it.  There’s not much reason to spend much time thinking about this.  There’s really only two options.</p>
<p>One, you refuse him, and that establishes in no uncertain terms that he is under you, and that whatever schemes he plans on far away from your sight will never amount to anything.</p>
<p>Two, you let him, and that just ends up encouraging him to be ambitious, think for himself, and seeking ways to better himself that may not directly benefit you.  </p>
<p>The answer is obvious.</p>

<p id="First">“Of course, Drivel!  I’m certain that if whatever is happening there interests you enough to brave this <i>terrible</i> weather to get there, then it must be an adequate use of your time.  Feel free to peruse whatever projects you see fit to in Eparchy.  Just be sure to report back regularly… I’m understandably curious about what you will discover!”</p>

<p>It’s obvious, because you’ve been in <i>exactly</i> this position before, and quite provably, option one <i>did not work</i>.  When Sivens tried to put you under his thumb, it just made you more eager to find ways to remove it entirely.  While the thought of what Drivel could get up to several miles distant from behind your back <i>does</i> con- make you uneasy, you are far more uneasy about failing to learn from Sivens example.  Besides, if nothing else, this will serve as a test of Drivel’s character… you have no doubt that if he actually <i>does</i> start to get up to some kind of… <i>shenanigans</i> with the Heads stationed in Eparchy, you’ll be able to detect it before it gets out of hand. </p>
<p>And, ultimately, it may be that there is nothing to fea- to be uneasy about.  After all, it is <i>Drivel</i>.  In spite of everything you’ve put him through, he still seems to be diligently following your every order, without a hint of treachery.  While it’s a dangerous thought for any Bakshish to have… it may be conceivable that you can actually <i>Trust</i> Drivel.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, it’s best to <i>have a little faith.</i></p>

<p>...What a curious turn of phrase.  You can’t quite recall where you heard it from.</p>
<hr>
<p>-and with the currently projected damages from the unusually cold winter, it’s possible that you will need to… to…</p>
<p>Hrm.   Odd.  For a moment there, your concentration lapsed.  Perhaps it’s the fact that the second rafter in your workshop has started to sag… then again, that largely just underscores the thought you were just having.</p>

<p>You are <b>The Layer of the Path</b>, and right now, you are slightly frustrated.</p>

<p>Not really about any specific thing, mind you… after all, all your particular projects as of late has largely gone off without a hitch.  And, while the fact that the current winter is throwing off several of your projected maintenance plans due to the amount of hail and sleet damage it’s imparted upon many of your once-pristine renovation projects, it shouldn’t result in much more than a few months of delay as you simply work to shore up any weaknesses that it exposes.  Setbacks like this are part and parcel of the Onagi’s responsibility, and you are by no means a stranger to having to rework months worth of scheduling on account of some unusual weather.</p>

<p>No, your frustration, bizarrely enough, seems to stem from the fact that you are… well… <i>frustrated</i>.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make a lot of sense, now that you think about it.  Which is also frustrating.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explain, even to yourself.  (Also frustrating.)  You suppose, really, the root of the issue is that, well… you are <i>bored</i>.   And that, frankly, is an unusual thing for you.  </p>
<p>You’ll grant that the current pace with which you have been pursuing various projects has been somewhat more accelerated than is normal for the Onagi, but for almost all of them, the haste felt… justifiable, you suppose.  After all, each one was intended to resolve an imminent, incipient, or even extant issue, and for several of them any delay might have meant some form of disaster for Eschaton, in one way or another. </p>
<p>However, now that the harsh, eroding nature of this winter has forced you and the Onagi to return to a more sedate, measured pace, concentrating fully on holding ground against all the damages it is inflicting, you are starting to realize that there may have been another reason you have been working tirelessly on project after project after project.</p>

<p>You think that reason may be that, well, working any less than tirelessly… tires you out.</p>
<p>What an odd way of putting it.  But it seems strangely applicable.  The longer you are forced to wait, patiently conserving resources and wisely tending to what achievements have already been made, instead of embarking on bold, new projects which will consume months of your time and effort, the more weary, agitated, and, as mentioned, frustrated you become.  </p>

<p>Indeed, more and more you’ve found yourself distracted by minor details, slight imperfections, that under normal circumstances would scarcely give you a moment’s pause.  Like the aforementioned rafter.  Really, it’s not sagging any more than should be expected in current conditions.  It’s well within functional parameters.  And yet, you find it constantly nagging at you.  You know there is no logical reason, nor even sufficient abundance of material, to justify removing the section of roof, unslinging the rafter, and replacing it with another that is slightly longer and better lacquered in order to avoid…</p>

<p>You exhale sharply, breath puffing in the frigid air.  </p>
<p>You hope that this fierce winter lets up soon.  Furthermore, you hope that your material stores can recover quickly once all the maintenance and repairs from the damage it’s causing are complete.  Pursuant to that, you hope that the quantity of gemstones the Samra have collected are sufficient to help replenish your flagging timber reserves…</p>

<p>Actually, now that you think about it, you remember that being an issue.  You were fairly confident you had a large quantity of various precious and semiprecious stones, but when you checked on the actual reserves, it seemed that there was less stored than you thought.  You never got around to looking into that discrepancy; after all, it was the Bakshish’ responsibility, and you had Eparchy to concern yourself with.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should look into that now.  If nothing else, you might be able to cast a few new quarries outside of Eschaton to help shore up the numbers…</p>
<hr>
<p>The constitution of a Crag is a blessed thing.  Although the Gifts of the Path walked by your Ancestors were largely intended to help their descendents to endure in the cold, thin air of the misty mountaintops, later experience would show that it was equally robust in other inhospitable environments, from the muggy swamps in the East to the burning deserts to the West.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of your rugged constitution, you once again find you and your robes drenched in sweat as you endure the inhospitable climes of the Lowlander Settlement known as Surt.  In particular, this establishment, known to the locals as <i>The Howl</i>… a perverse name, but in fairness, that perversity is what brings you here… is nearly unbearable.  However, as your previous travels showed, there is no better place in all the Lowlands to conduct the business you aim to conduct today.</p>

<p>You are <b>Mountain Mother Dismas</b>, and in spite of all the alien chaos that surrounds you, in spite of the heat and the choking air, you find yourself at peace in this place.  After all, you have a purpose.  And there is no finer thing for a Crag to have.</p>

<p>The proprietor of this establishment was accommodating enough to allow you to conduct your business here, although with the stipulation that you do so in the ‘Creepy old man corner’.  That suited your purposes just fine.  A degree of cultural sensitivity was necessary for your purpose.  </p>
<p>However, you are not alone in this corner.  Indeed, you share it with a number of Fires; an eclectic assortment, no doubt, but the Fires are an eclectic people.  They are brash, chaotic, unpredictable… much akin to their namesake.  In particular, it is that predictable unpredictability you seek today.  For, in spite of their chaotic nature, you have learned well that there is one stimulus which all Fires respond positively to.</p>

<p>Wordlessly, you reach within your robes, and pull forth your stimulus; a red emerald, expertly willed, its facets casting scintillating light from the pyres present within the establishment.  Holding it aloft, you can see the desire in their massive eyes.  </p>
<p id="grey">“I trust this will be ample recompense?” you say, softly. </p>
<p>They needn’t say anything in reply.  The naked greed in their grins tells you all you need to know.</p>

<p>A sirocco blows through Surt.  It promises Adventure Capitalism.</p>

</div>

<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic</b>: <i>While The Layer finds herself bogged down with handling the ravages of winter, another group of Crag have moved to appropriate many of the resources that would be hers by right.  The Mountain Mothers, seeking a currency by which to further their goals in the Lowlands, have appropriated a considerable store of precious and semiprecious stones, many of them freshly extracted from the bountiful mines of Eparchy.  While little more than shiny decorations to the Crag, these baubles, appropriately willed and cut, hold great value to many Lowlander elves.  In particular, the Fires, a free-spirited, entrepreneurial people, respond quite positively to these rare stones.  However, the Mothers may be tampering with forces they do not fully comprehend...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Mercantilism(Expedition)</b> Skill to hire Surtian Adventurers to place the Temporary Aspect Firey Friends upon one of the Settlements of the other Elven races.  To be frank, the Mothers know precious little about many of the Elven Variants, and so they hope to use the reputation of the Fire elves, who are far better known to the otherelves than the Crag are, to make inroads into one of these settlements, hoping to achieve more fruitful results than their first attempt.  Which settlement, in particular, is a bit of a crapshoot, pursuant to the contacts of whichever band of Fires they manage to hire this season.</p>
<p>Having appropriated some of the wealth of Eparchy to make this transaction, they will spend a fate point to Invoke the Aspect Pumping Iron:Massive Gains to add a Proficiency die to this check.</p>

<p><b>Political</b>:  <i>Pursuant to above, the Mothers continue their investigations into the Lowlands;  Limited in their range, however, they now find themselves somewhat dependent on the Surtian Fires they hope to attract to their aid.  While their intent is to perform their investigations in much the same way as they did in Surt, the specific destination is a bit dicey...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spycraft(Espionage)</b> skill to represent the Mothers’ continued investigations.  Unusually, the target of their investigations is somewhat in question; other than the infrequent arrival of the River elf Flotilla, they have little other option to get to other elven settlements than to rely on these Fire Elves to take them to their destination.  However, wherever they end up, they will rely on the same degree of tireless questioning that they utilized in Surt.</p>
<p>Should their attempt to solicit useful adventurers with the Mercantilism check succeed, they will attempt to Invoke the resulting aspect to add a Proficiency die to this roll; for streamlining purposes, I entrust the GM to add this die in should it become conditionally available. </p>

<p><b>Military</b>: <i>Having learned from past experiences, Embebi knows better than to conduct expeditions in the dangerous reaches she is searching in winter.  However, winter is no reason to remain idle; as part of Echo’s attempts to prepare the Aggro for the upcoming war, and with Embebi’s hesitant blessing, he embarked to the cliffsides of Eparchy with the collection of Stalker washouts and would-bes, hoping that his particular style of intensive training might be what is needed to make them finally battle-ready.  Besides, under a normal winter, those cliffs shouldn’t have been that much more dangerous...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Military Science(Drill)</b> Skill to allow Echo a chance to try and add more Talcsome Stalkers to Division Vigor of Youth.  Since they do not seem to lack willing spirits, but rather, willing flesh, he hopes to put them through rigorous winter training on the Steep Cliffsides outside of Eparchy.  Indeed, since it had not yet been used, he will use the Free Invoke upon said Steep Cliffsides to add a Proficiency die to the roll, on top of the Boost die still present from Embebi’s efforts.  </p>

<p><b>Mental</b>: <i>Have a little faith.  A curious phrase, but one which seems to resonate with The First for reasons he can’t quite explain.  Indeed, he originally intended Drivel’s research to be focused on purely… ahem… procreative endeavors, but as he reviews the notes, he can’t help but be tempted by the thought that, perhaps, the missing key to understanding the bloodlines and subtypes of Lowland elves… might rest in understanding their Creator.</i></p>
<p><i>As such, he embarks on a small tangent to his current research; Drivel’s notes indicate that one of the common ways to gain the favor… and, he reasons, thus the Knowledge… of the divinities is to perform rituals and rites that are pleasing to them.  These take a myriad of forms and a panoply of names, but one term seems to be quite common: Obedience.</i></p>
<p><i>However, there’s an issue; while the notes on Caelestros are as thorough as they can be, they are also hopelessly out of date… and, furthermore, it may be difficult to say what acts may be found as pleasing to a deity that is, by all reports, somewhat insane.  What would please such a god?  Perhaps she would wish for her patronage of art to be recognized?   Or, perhaps, she would prefer to be known for the healing she showers upon her faithful?  She is known, as well, for her mastery of wave and sea… as foreign as that concept is to most Crag.  But who is to say... apart from the Lowlanders, of course, but you can’t really trust them to be impartial.  After all, it could be that their goddess has languished so long in her pride and madness that she seeks even darker obedience…</i></p>
<p><i>The truth is likely somewhere between, and any sources you might use are likely riddled with superstition and dogma.  Looks like if you want to know the will of a Goddess, you have to figure it out yourself.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spirituality(Research)</b> skill to ferret out the Obedience of Caelestros.   Admittedly a wild tangent, the First’s encounter with the Divine and the nagging sense that he’s missing something fundamental about the Elven Condition have driven him to this.  Should he succeed, he will also use this time to Retrain a feat to represent his new knowledge...</p>


<p><b>End of Turn</b> </p>

<p><b>Results-</b></p>
<p><b>Economic</b>- The Mothers learn a valuable lesson: While wisdom and patience are the stones with which you lay a path that can last for generations, naked greed and hard commodities produce results <i>fast</i>. A few flashes of the shiny gemstones and they are absolutely inundated with eager recruits. The only difficulty is in selecting the ones most able to actually be helpful.</p>

<p>In that, they are successful. They find an appropriate group, large enough to travel safely with but small enough to not be wildly suspicious, and manage to select a party that at least averages out to competent. With their courageous companions selected, the Mothers go about asking them where, exactly, they suggest they go next.</p>

<p>Really, they should have expected the answer...</p>

<p><b>Political</b>- When told that the Mothers wish to investigate a lowlander settlement, your gaggle of misfit fire elf adventurers huddle and whisper amongst themselves. When they break, they give a unanimous vote: Those stuck up blade elves are always looking over our shoulder, let's do it to them for a change! The destination they decide on is Fort Álfyr. With little other choice, the Mothers go along with it. After all, these blades have been one of the main subtypes interacting with the Crag. It will be quite necessary to get a measure of them.</p>

<p>In that, they seem to have quite the advantage. While Fort Álfyr is not exactly a booming tourist town, the humble accomodations available suit the Mothers quite well. All the less distracting for learning of the blades. They keep the cold out. Indeed, the modest but comfortable accomodations seem apt for the stark but loyal blade elves.</p>

<p>To the Mother’s surprise, the blade elves seem more than willing to talk extremely openly about themselves and their history. Ehra himself comes to talk to the Mothers at length. The blade elves wear their allegiances and their history on their sleeve. They do not hide who they were, or where they are from. They do not conceal the events that made them what they are. If anything, they tell as many people as possible. The reason is simple: They do not want the harsh lessons they learned, lessons learned in blood, to ever be forgotten.</p>

<p>In this exchange, the Mothers believe they get a good assessment of the blade elves. They are a people quite worthy of their namesake, for they seem made of steel. Not physically - the blades are hardly more resilient than the average lowlander elf, especially among the hardier subtypes found in this region. They are nowhere near as resilient as a Crag.</p>

<p>It is in their minds, or more in their very selves that they have strength. Though their lives are stoic and rigid, the Mothers find their discipline gives them incredible willpower and drive. They have an immense reserve of mental fortitude that could see them through the harshest of time, and to an elf are so loyal that even the darkest and deepest magic would have a hard time in swaying their resolute intent.</p>

<p>It is good that the Crag have been working towards becoming an ally with these elves, as the Mothers believe that once a blade elf considers you a friend, they will never betray that trust.</p>

<p>Oh, and they hang around the Fort long enough to get a good look at its general layout and the capabilities of the town if you care about that kind of thing. They don’t get let into any extremely sensitive areas or anything, but they get a good overall impression. </p>

<p>Fort Álfyr</p>
<p>A long abandoned decaying Lycan fort on a rocky coastline has been turned into a well-organized and healthy settlement. The town is growing into a thriving hub in the heart of elven territory, and the Fort itself is one of the safest places for hundreds of miles The Academy at the center of the Fort is the core of the city.</p>

<p>Settlement Aspects: </p>
<p>Fort Álfyr, Reborn: The fortress itself has been remade, better and stronger than it ever was before. Surtian concrete has reinforced the defenses, Crag steel has armed the defenders, and training from all manner of exotic elven Warmasters has equipped its defenders for any attack. It is a truly formidable fortification.</p>

<p>Blade Academy: The blade elves have developed the system of barracks that they constructed earlier into a full blown military academy. It is a well developed building, with a thoroughly invested staff and training regimen. They are slowly but surely building their catalog of elven warfare, and their war scholars are becoming a bastion of knowledge and preparation.</p>

<p>Special: This Aspect may be motivated for free, but only if two allied elven factions use it for Cooperation under the Drill trapping of Military Science on the same turn.</p>

<p>Sheltered Farms: The Fort’s defensive perimeter has been expanded to provide defensible fortifications for the farms surrounding the settlement. While they are hardly strongholds in and of themselves, they are defensible locations that can continue to produce in times of strife and are difficult to sabotage.</p>

<p>Terrain Aspects:</p>
<p>Coastal Port: The blade elves have constructed a simple system of docks, which they are currently using for a humble fleet of fishing vessels.</p>

<p>River- Fort Álfyr is located on the Goldfall river.</p>

<p>Size: Town</p>

<p>Garrison: Currently full with Alpha and Bravo Divisions.</p>


<p><b>Military</b>- The Echo of Blood is a hard man to train under, which is good because hard times are no doubt ahead. Embebi has done good ground work. She has identified many candidates that Echo would have otherwise passed over. She has generated a lot of interest in other castes joining the aggro, and has provided a heroic example for other elves to aspire to.</p>

<p>That makes it easy. All Echo has to do is drive them to their absolute physical and mental limits and hew rough stone into polished art. At this, he is exceedingly good. His reputation and recent victories give him a heroic reputation that other aggro aspire to emulate.  He is even able to prevent disaster and rescue all of his talcsome when a particularly nasty blizzard sweeps through during an escape and evasion drill. It is refreshing to train aggro completely under his own will again, instead of at the direction of the blades.</p>

<p>He does find himself thankful for their training. It makes a large difference in his ability to motivate his new aggro and produce results. In the end, Ehra did give him what he wanted: He feels like a Warmaster true.</p>

<p><b>Mental</b>-  The First no longer has a nagging sense that he is missing something fundamental about elven nature. He now has a grim certainty that he is missing something fundamental about elven nature.</p>

<p>His search turns out to be a frustrating path of dead ends and endless looping paths. The Divine is a difficult path to follow with logic on the best days, and Calestros in specific is a deity of madness. Her portfolio is full of dozens, if not hundreds of different ways of worshipping her. Some of these are radically different from one another. Some outright contradict each other. He was under the impression that “heresy” is a huge deal to lowlanders, but it seems that for Calestros followers many just accept that they’re all heretics to someone. They take it in stride. How does that even work?</p>

<p>He has a similar problem in the obedience rituals themselves. He finds a dizzying array of candidates, but he just… can’t really get them to work. He goes through the motions of a few less distasteful ones, but it produces little to no results whatsoever. Worse, he finds more obedience rituals that seem to contradict the ones he already tried. Those <i>also</i> don’t work. Are these all just madness and lies? An elaborate prank? Why isn’t it <i>working?</i></p>

<p>First’s frustrations and lack of progress are palpable, but not crippling. Though it is disappointing, he does not let it cloud his judgment or drive him to do anything rash. The only thing lost in this pursuit is time, and even then he has perhaps gained perspective.</p>
