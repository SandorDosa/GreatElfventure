    <h1>Aloft Again</h1>
<p>Shadimon looked out over Asavardi's canyon, let out a long breath, and stepped off the ledge. He turned the shallow dive into a smooth turn, paying close attention to his wings. He'd done as much embarrassing flapping as he could on the ground to try to rebuild the muscle he had lost, and the new feathers were finally done growing. Everything felt right, if stiff, and he continued gliding easily down the length of the canyon.</p>

<p>It was winter, but there were always rising thermals coming out of the desert. He caught one and rode it upward, reveling in the feel of the wind on his face and through his feathers. There were other people out, of course. Several were on their way between tasks, but just as many were out flying for the joy of it. Some of those waved to him as he went by, slowly climbing.</p>

<p>It had been so long, impossibly long, since he had last flown. But now, finally being in the air again, he was able to let go of the cold knot of tension in his chest. He knew exactly what he needed to do to be properly rid of it.</p>

<p>There were tricks all flyers learned, and mastery of them determined just how good any one person was. Shadimon was one of the best. The legendary speed and agility of the winged elves required absolute trust of instincts and judgement. At the speeds they could move, thoughts just got in the way. The best flyers learned to rely on everything <i>but</i> conscious thought.</p>

<p>Shadimon angled himself up higher with strong, steady wingbeats, feeling the muscles warm up and loosen. That was the proper test to see if he had regained what he had lost. He drove himself higher, and at the apogee of his flight, he stalled and let himself fall.</p>

<p>He held his wings steady as he fell, feeling the minute adjustments as his feathers shifted to keep him on course. It was so easy, and so freeing, to settle into the feeling of feathers and muscle and wind, to simply be.</p>

<p>He plunged below the lip of the canyon and snapped his wings open, turning the dive into a blistering pass just above the river. Asavardi raced by as he went. Over the thunder of the water and his wings, he could faintly hear people whooping and cheering. The tips of his feathers almost brushed the water as he followed the curves of the river, twisting around rocks. The memorial grove flashed by, and then the Goldfalls loomed up ahead of him. He angled his wings, twisted his shoulders, and then he was shooting through the spray and up the falls. He cleared the top in a rush, trailing mist, and laughing for the joy of it.</p>

<p>As he glided back to the village, people clapped and cheered and flashed their wings; they were as glad to see him back up as he was. His landing wasn't as flawless as he would have liked, but he was satisfied with the low aching burn across his chest and shoulders. He was back where he belonged.</p>
