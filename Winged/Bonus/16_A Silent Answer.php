<h1>A Silent Answer</h1>

<p>Anasatri arrived to the Watchtower early in the spring. Thuridan and the other researchers were thrilled to see her, and quickly gave her a tour of the entire place. The basement archive itself had been partially converted into temporary living spaces. “It gets damned cold here in the winter,” Thuridan grumbled. “At least down here it stays warm enough. No fireplaces, of course, but we have braziers and blankets enough.”</p>
<p>Most of the work had been done in the archive; shelves and sections had been labeled, and the slate on the wall was covered in notations. Each shelf had a piece of paper tacked on it with notes of what was where, and there was a master list of decoded meanings of the Lycan filing system.</p>
<p>The first week of her stay was spent in the archive helping. They had split the records into straightforward charts and more esoteric accounts, and were focusing on the charts for the time being. They didn’t seem to be sorted by location or time, so a great deal of time was spent cataloging that information along with where they had been found on the shelves.</p>
<p>“There’s a reason for it, there has to be, but we haven’t figured it out yet,” Naleryn told her. “We’re compiling as much information as we can in the hopes that a pattern will show up eventually. Something based on the moon, we thought, but there isn’t a pattern there yet either. If only we had someone to ask.”</p>
<p>Anasatri looked across the room, skimming the shelves. </p>
<p><i>When you don’t know, ask.</i></p>
<p>It was practically the official motto of the winged elves. <i>If you don’t know, ask. </i></p>
<p>Her eyes caught on the grey feather hanging near the stairs, <i>If only the Loremaster had survived...</i> Suddenly she knew what to do.</p>
<p>Anasatri was an oracle, and her powers were as mysterious to her as to anyone else. But there were times that she just Knew things. It was like finding a friendly windstream, and her feathers shivered.</p>
<p><i>When you don’t know, ask. Ask the source.</i></p>
<hr/>
<p>She waited a few more days until the full moon, making preparations. She didn’t need to plan; that had all been part of the flash of insight. She waited until the others had moved back down to the archive for the night, and took herself and her supplies up to the observatory dome. Everyone knew she was up to something, but left her alone when asked.</p>
<p>It wasn’t time yet, so she paced around the room. Very little had been done; most of the cogs and gears from the broken machine were still where they had fallen. <i>Was it intentional, I wonder? Taken apart on purpose? Or vandalism? Or just time?</i> There were shelves in the room, most of them empty. Scattered papers had been swept up along with the layer of dust, but not much else had been disturbed. Through one of the windows, she finally saw the full moon peek over the horizon. While she waited for it to fully rise, she found a clear space in the center of the room and sat down.</p>
<p>She relaxed her wings, letting them drape around her like a cape of feathers. On her lap she had one of the star charts, a physical embodiment of the knowledge she was seeking. She put a blank piece of paper on the floor in front of her and picked up a charcoal stick. As the moon fully rose, she blew out the small lamp she had brought, and waited for her eyes to adjust to the dim light. A faint breeze came through the windows, rustling her feathers, and she closed her eyes and focused on it.</p>
<p>She focused on Seeking, spreading her feathers to catch that ethereal wind, and felt the floor fade out from under her. The world around her seemed to fade into mist, and she spread her wings to glide through it. Out into that mist, she sent her call.</p>
<p>“<i>Luna, my name is Anasatri. I’m sure you can see me here in your observatory. We’ve inherited it from your children, and we don’t want to see it lost. But they’re brilliant, and we don’t understand. It’s full of secrets, and full of You. We don’t know You. I wish to learn, will you speak to me? Will you allow us to save these things?</i>"</p>
<p>The words faded out into the distance, and Anasatri continued gliding through the fog. Sometimes a clear path appeared, and sometimes it didn’t. She could stay in this place for a certain amount of time, and chose to this time. While she glided, she continued thinking out loud. Talking to Luna? She wasn’t sure. </p>
<p>“<i>We’re a people of the daytime sky; night is a mystery to us. We see You, we see the stars, but we can’t read them. If we could, maybe we could fly safely at night. This place, it’s huge. We’ve never seen anything like it before. I’d like to see it turn into a place for knowledge. Ours, Yours, anyone’s, all available for people to learn. That’s what I want, I think. I want to learn things, and I want other people to be able to learn things. All the things! If we don’t look outside of ourselves, we’ll miss too many things, and what a </i>waste<i> that would be.</i>"</p>
<p>She felt a shiver in the wind, and knew her time was running out. “<i>Thank you for listening!</i>” She glided down through the fog, into dim light, and gradually felt the floor under her again. </p>
<p>The cold floor of the orrery chamber greeted her. As her awareness slowly returned to her, she realized that she was bathed in moonlight. The moonlight streamed through the tall, narrow window that Anasatri was watching Luna through. It outlined where she was sitting almost perfectly. It was a cloudless night, and with Luna's brightness upon her Anasatri could see almost as clearly as if it were day even with her diurnal eyes.</p>
<p>Anasatri felt something. A hum at the edges of her senses. The Lycans always talked about Luna's light, and she was beginning to understand why. It felt like a real, physical thing; wrapping around her like a warm blanket and filling her wings as though it were a gentle thermal. She felt the hum resolve into something else, a feeling unlike any other. It felt like a thin string made of gold, tugging at her heart and connecting her to something vast and unknowable.</p>
<p>The connection was subtle but unmistakably powerful, like a vast deep well. Anasatri could feel a presence. She looked up at Luna and suddenly understood what Lycans meant when they said that their goddess was "right there." It felt like She was in the room, filling the tiny space with infinite presence.</p>
<p>Anasatri prepared herself. The presence did not change. Anasatri felt no words, no guidance. There was only complete silence. She was there, she was connected, but there was no answer. No emotion. Nothing but vast, infinite, unfathomable quiet. Anasatri folded her wings tightly.</p>
<p><i>Please?</i></p>
<p>There was nothing. The presence faded. The hum quieted. The string gently severed. The observatory felt cold again.</p>
<p>Anasatri slumped over, trying to manage her sadness and disappointment. Luna had heard her plea, of that she was sure. She had even made a connection, but said nothing. Perhaps She really did only speak to Her children. There had been no disgust, no hate, only perfect silence.</p>
<p><i>Thank you for listening</i>, Anasatri thought again, <i>I am sorry I was not worthy.</i></p>
<p>Well, it was a shot in the dark. Literally. Talking to even your own deity who has a personal connection to you is difficult at the best of times. This was bridging a massive gap, and it had been highly unlikely she would get anything. She had made some kind of connection at least, and it was not a strictly negative one. She had felt some small comfort from Luna's presence, that was something. Maybe there was some significance to that.</p>
<p>Anasatri resolved to come back to that when she was feeling less depressed.</p>
<p>It was quite late by this point. Talking to the moon has its downsides. Anasatri carefully gathered her materials and returned them to their proper place. Exhausted, she returned to the warm pile of her fellow researchers in the basement.</p>
<p>Surrounded by the wings of her friends, Anasatri fell asleep.</p>
<p>Anasatri dreams.</p>
<p>A vast starfield greets her. She feels a warm thermal under her wings, lifting her into the night sky. She is surrounded by stars, clear and bright as she has ever seen them before. She gazes with wonder at the breathtaking sight before taking in more of her surroundings.</p>
<p>She looks below her and sees the world sprawling beneath her. Illuminated by moonlight, she can just barely make out watchtower rock below her. She sees lights in the canyons to the east. Asavardi. She can see Fort Alfyr, the Hilt'Inn, even Surt and the northern mountains, as well as the vast deserts to the south. She is far, far higher than she could ever actually fly.</p>
<p>Luna is there. Vast, unknowable, and silent. The moon is massive and close, glowing brightly in full. Anasatri feels that same presence. She realizes she is in Luna's domain. She gazes up at the silent goddess.</p>
<p><i>I have so many questions</i>, Anasatri reaches out, <i>I want to know You.</i></p>
<p>The stars shift. Anasatri looks up at them. They do not move, but they change. Clusters of stars connect and spread to one another, becoming a very real form. The sky slowly fills with animals. A bear, a crow, an owl, a badger, a wolverine… all made of stars. Each one unique, spread all over the sky, and some animals she does not recognize.</p>
<p><i>No</i>, she realizes. <i>Not animals. A family. Ancestors?</i></p>
<p>The ancestor totems. The ones that Lycans spoke of as if they were distant family. They are constellations, she realizes. As visible and ever-present as Luna herself.</p>
<p>One of them moves. A wolf. It approaches Luna, small and insignificant with its head bowed in respect. It approaches Luna and sits, ears perked.</p>
<p>In the glowing surface of the moon itself, Anasatri sees a form. A humanoid woman, spectral and indistinct. Made of moonlight. From the moon, the woman floats forward and gently places a hand on the head of the wolf.</p>
<p><i>The Mother</i> Anasatri realizes, as if she had known that her whole life.</p>
<p>Mother Luna strokes the still-bowed head of the starstuff wolf. It is a comforting, accepting gesture. Anasatri sees the form of the wolf change slightly. Small wisps of snowflakes fall from its form.</p>
<p><i>The Huntress?</i> The wolf is an aspect of Luna like the woman, but also… something else? Several somethings? The revelation enters Anasatri's mind, but she does not understand.</p>
<p>There is something wrong.</p>
<p>There is something burning at the edge of Anasatri’s senses. Something painful and red, throbbing like a bad headache. For some reason, her eye is drawn to the horizon. She realizes she’s so high up it curves.</p>
<p>Something rises over the horizon. It is black, moving slowly. Anasatri gasps as she realizes that it is a wolf, with black fur and yellow eyes. <i>Impossibly</i> huge, so massive that its paws are larger than cities and its ears scrape the stars. The wolf’s yellow eyes center on Luna.</p>
<p>Anasatri wants to yell out a warning, but she cannot speak. </p>
<p>The wolf rises, nearly as large as the world beneath it. Its head reaches into the sky. As it rises, so does the pain that was previously at the edge of Anasatri’s senses. There is a look on the wolf’s face, one of hunger. It opens its mouth with teeth the size of mountains - teeth made of silver.</p>
<p><i>What?</i></p>
<p>The black wolf lunges, clamping its teeth down on Luna herself. There is a sound that Anasatri’s mind cannot comprehend, but only translates as horrific pain, betrayal, agony, and sorrow. Her vision blurs, but Anasatri forces herself to focus.</p>
<p><i>She wants me to see this,</i> Anasatri tells herself, <i>I have to try to understand.</i></p>
<p>There is a howl of pain. The black wolf bites down harder. With a deafening noise, cracks begin to form on Luna’s form. Darkness creeps around the edge, slowly covering Her surface. The Mother’s form raises her hands in fear.</p>
<p>The smaller wolf, the one made from snow and starstuff, begins to fall away from Luna. The Mother figure reaches out towards her, but it is too late. As the black wolf continues to try to devour Luna, the Mother’s form disintegrates. She fades into wisps of moonlight that soon dissipate.</p>
<p><i>Pain, horrible horrible pain.</i></p>
<p>The wind in Anasatri’s wings goes ice cold. She gathers all of the willpower she has to try to stay in the vision. She is a loremaster, an oracle. She can do this.</p>
<p>The stars shake as if they are about to fall from the sky. She sees the totems, the ancestors, writhing in agony. Some of them begin to fade. The howl of pain rises. The black wolf bites down.</p>
<p>Darkness flows over Luna’s face, slowly covering Her. Luna’s light fades from the sky around Anasatri. The black wolf is not sated. The wolf made of star and snow continues to fall, streaking towards the world below.</p>
<p><i>Focus!</i> Anasatri orders herself, <i>One thing at a time!</i></p>
<p>She focuses on the black wolf - no, she suddenly understands. Not one wolf. Millions of wolves, writhing together as a single form. Trying to tear their Goddess from the sky. Anasatri does not understand.</p>
<p>She focuses on Luna. Darkness covers her surface. Cracks run through her core. The last sliver of Her reflected light disappears. Her light no longer fills the sky or falls upon the world. She is a circle of black in the sky. She is… <i>dying</i>, Anasatri suddenly realizes. The pain doubles in her mind.</p>
<p><i>Stay! Please!</i> Wait, was that me? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Something tugs at the edge of Anasatri's consciousness. A presence… many presences? Past? Future? She does not understand it.</p>
<p><i>Stay with the vision!</i> She commands herself.</p>
<p>The falling wolf. A stream of melting snow and starstuff sheds off of it. It is disintegrating as it falls to the earth. Falling apart, like sand in the wind. It streaks downwards towards the world. Anasatri realizes she can see where it is going to hit the earth. It is… north of her. Somewhere between Fort Alfyr and the Hilt’Inn? Along… the Goldfall? It has to be significant, but the pain and overwhelming force flooding her mind keep her from thinking about it.</p>
<p>There is a deafening roar. Anasatri is not sure if it is sound or if it is in her mind. Technically… Not now! She tears her attention back to Luna.</p>
<p>A wave of force rolls through the black wolf. She watches its teeth crack and shatter. It reels and falls away from Luna. The roar of pain becomes unbearable. The black wolf is falling apart. Its yellow eyes burn with hate, focusing on Anasatri. She has a moment of horror as those eyes burn into her, but they suddenly wink out. The millions of wolves that made up the black fall away, burning in cold fire as they die. There is a howl of agony that seems to come from reality itself.</p>
<p>Anasatri feels her mind begin to dissociate. It’s as if a million other perspectives a million other minds are trying to share space with hers. She sees starfields, hundreds of them, all at once. A vast consciousness, ancient and unknowable, threatens to overwhelm her own. It is too much for a mortal mind to contain. She screams.</p>
<p>"Anasatri?"</p>
<p>Anasatri bolted upright. She was back in the Watchtower, sleeping among her fellow researchers in the archive. Her head was pounding, skin covered in goosebumps. She was panting to catch her breath. There was a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Anasatri, are you alright?" Naleryn asked, "It sounded like you were having a terrible nightmare."</p>
<p>The pounding pain in her head had already begun to diminish. Anasatri took stock of herself for a few moments. Rattled, but fine.</p>
<p>"Yes, just a nightmare," she lied, "I am fine."</p>
<p>"Do you need anything Satri?" Naleryn asked with concern.</p>
<p>Nightmares were not anything uncommon after what they had all survived.</p>
<p>"No," Anasatri shook her head, "I'm just going to go get some water."</p>
<p>"'Kay," Naleryn sounded skeptical, "but I'm here if you need me."</p>
<p>Anasatri quietly thanked her and stood.</p>
<p>There was a basin with clean water upstairs. She could get some fresh air, and the cool air might clear her mind a bit. She headed for the stairs.</p>
<p><i>Why didn't I tell her I had a vision?</i> She asked herself as she ascended.</p>
<p>She pondered that answer as she walked the darkened halls of the observatory that now felt familiar. The pounding pain was already gone and her mind was beginning to clear as she reached the basin. </p>
<p>She splashed some cold water on her face and took a few sips. Normally she wouldn't shut up about it if she had a vision, especially one as vivid and powerful as that. Why hadn't she told Naleryn?</p>
<p><i>It was personal,</i> she realized.</p>
<p>Anasatri felt like she had been confided in. Shown something deeply painful and intimate. She didn't even begin to understand what she had seen, and she did not want to violate the strange sense of trust she felt had been placed on her.</p>
<p>Well, she knew what to do after a strange vision. She walked over to one of the scribe stations, lit a candle, and began to write down what she has seen in as much detail as she could recall. Details were often critical in interpreting a vision like this.</p>
<p>A revelation struck her. The quill clattered from her fingers. The shock wore off and was replaced with awe.</p>
<p><i>I remember the starfields!</i></p>
<p>Indeed, she realized she could recall each and every starfield Luna had shown her with perfect clarity. It cost her no more stress or effort than remembering her own name, yet she could recall the exact position of each and every star in the sky that Luna had shown her over several night skies, including the one that had been visible for most of the vision.</p>
<p>A sudden breeze blew out her candle. There was a slight clatter from nearby. Ansatri looked down and realized her hands were framed in pale light. She looked up and realized a shuttered window had been blown open. There, framed perfectly centered in the small window frame, was Luna.</p>
<p>Anasatri felt like she was being watched.</p>
<p><i>What have I gotten myself into?</i></p>
<p>-FIN-</p>
