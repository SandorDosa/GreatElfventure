<h1>Summer Year 1: Turn 1</h1>

<p>The winged elves are born travelers, but their specialty is swift, lightly-burdened journeys. The task of moving hundreds of people and supplies to sustain them was a challenge, and they were more than grateful to the river elves and dreamdust elves for their help in moving bulky and heavier things.</p>

<p>The morning dawned clear and warm, and many people had already been up and seeing to final preparations. Varna and the scout corps had headed out as soon as there was light to see by. They had already done some short-range scouting to report on possible hazards to the river elves, and they were to continue that work until the groups had to separate. </p>

<p>The frenzy of last-minute preparations paused for celebration; a river elf couple were entering an official pair-bond, and everyone was invited to the short ceremony. Once those festivities were concluded, a hush fell over everything before being broken by wild cheers as the great barges started moving. The creaking and groaning of ropes and wood was the signal Shadimon had been waiting for. His sharp whistle was echoed up and down the line of winged elves, and their own travels began.</p>

<p>The unburdened flyers went first, those carrying only their own supplies. They went up in a rush of wings into the clear morning sky, and Shadimon’s heart lurched at the sight. Hope, finally, after so long.</p>

<p>As soon as the first group had cleared the air, the pairs carrying cargo nets took off. The nets carried bulky but light things like tents and fabric for the entire wing. Lastly went the teams with the carry baskets. Lightweight wicker baskets the size of a small cart were carried by teams of four, and had been obsessively balanced and secured to prevent any shifting during flight. Each team wallowed into the air, one by one, quickly forming a neat line and following after the others.</p>

<p>Once the last of his people took to the air, Shadimon turned and lifted a hand and wing in salute toward the fort, and he and Baijani took off after the others. They quickly overtook the baskets and joined the others near the front. The river rolled to the horizon below them, the flotilla quickly shrinking as they flew higher. Further back, near the receding fort, clouds of dust and faint cries marked the dreamdust elves getting their herds moving.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since so many had flown together, and they quickly settled into small formations strung out for over a mile down the length of the river. At intervals, the baskets dropped back to change teams, but the main body went on. A pause at midday for a meal let them rest their wings, but they all felt an urgency and need to be somewhere instead of in transit.</p>
 
<p>It was fortunate in a way, Shadimon reflected, that their remaining people were mostly combatants and their support network. There were very few children among them, which could have added a layer of logistical difficulty to what was already promising to be a grueling journey. The few there were either rode firmly strapped into a basket or swaddled onto one of their parents. 
They continued on through the afternoon, and as the sun started sinking, Shadimon spotted their scouts winging back toward them, skimming along the surface of the water. Most of them continued on to rendezvous with the flotilla, but two split off and soared up to join them. </p>

<p><i>All well</i>, the first signaled, and Shadimon returned it.</p>

<p><i>Camp ahead</i>, the other added. <i>Beacon placed</i>. Message delivered, the two of them dove again to catch up with the others. Baijani whistled, and heard the signal repeated up and down the line. They all started slowly drifting lower, while those in the lead searched for the beacon. Shadimon and Baijani followed as the front-runners found it. The beacon was a thin, flat sheet of metal hung from a tree, polished to a mirror shine that caught the light as it twisted in the breeze. </p>

<p>They all still remembered well how to set up a temporary ground camp, and went to those duties with easy familiarity. As they were preparing the evening meal, the river flotilla glided by, the oarsmen hailing them as they passed.</p>

<p>They continued the pattern for the next several weeks, and it was thankfully uneventful. There were the usual collections of minor mishaps and injuries associated with travel, but nothing they hadn’t dealt with before. The injured were even able to rest onboard the flotilla’s rafts, so the whole convoy could keep moving.</p>

<p>When the river turned south, the dark elves and dreamdust elves split away, heading out for their own prospects. A few of the dreamdust elf runners stayed, volunteers to manage the pack animals the winged elves had been given. After staying with the flotilla a bit longer, the winged elves turned into the canyons while the river elves lingered in more open water. The journey slowed then, as they were weighed down with heavier cargo the rafts had been carrying, but the slower pace let them truly appreciate the spectacular scenery around them, and gave them a sense of what they had claimed. </p>

<p>The entrance to the canyon system was a dip between the mountains, the broad valley broken by stone monuments rising from the foothills. The further in they went, the taller the cliffs rose, and the more fantastic structures they saw. Great pillars and arches, sculpted by wind and rain, filled the valley, glowing red and gold in the sun. The red cliffs and rocks were streaked in white and black and rich brown with shocks of bright greenery and unexpected flowers. The river meandered below, a bright blue ribbon occasionally broken by frothing white over tumbled stone or waterfalls.</p>

<p>As the days passed, the cliff walls slowly closed in, going from a rumpled, rocky plain to a true canyon. They camped on the tops of cliffs, feeling more secure than they had in years. The overall mood lightened considerably, and the night air was filled with music and stories.</p>

<p>The scouts continued flying ahead, and found no signs of danger. Shadimon alternated where in their formation he flew, trying to keep himself available to anyone who might need him. He took his turns in the carrying teams, and even spent a day carrying a fussy infant to give the exhausted mother a break. </p>

<p>On a day where Shadimon was flying in one of the flanking wings, he saw their scouts speeding back toward them, much earlier than usual. They were all visibly excited, and started signaling that there was no danger as soon as they were close enough. A ripple of interest went through the group, read in faster wingbeats and perked ears. </p>

<p>Most winged elves couldn’t hover, at least not for long, so the scouts went into a tight spiral pattern as Shadimon hurried up to meet them. “We found it!” Varna shouted over the wind. “We found a place to settle! It’s not far!” He wheeled away back upriver, flying in a quick darting pattern as the news spread back through the main group. Tired wings found a little more strength, and even the carry baskets forged ahead.</p>

<p>Varna and the scouts led them to a canyon nearly a quarter mile wide, with towering sheer walls. The scouts landed on one of the cliff tops and the rest followed suit, quickly shucking off baggage and carry harnesses. By the time a small guard group had been assigned to watch the supplies, most of the others were already exploring the canyon. </p>

<p>Shadimon stood on the edge of the cliff and surveyed the opposite wall. It was studded with cave mouths of all sizes, as well as many ledges, several of which sported thriving plants. “Looks good,” Baijani said, coming up to stand next to him. “Those caves are a good place to start, and will save us some work. Looks like there may also be some seasonal waterfalls, probably in the spring.” She leaned over and looked further down, “The walls slope inward from the bottom, too. Look, not by much, but enough to make it hard to climb.”</p>

<p>“Safe from below, yes, but from up here…?” Shadimon looked behind them at the rocky scrub giving way to pine forest. </p>

<p>Baijani shrugged, “Scout patrols, and we would want farms up here anyway. We could see trouble coming a long way off. There may be other canyons that way that we haven’t seen yet.” Her wings quivered, “And stone doesn’t burn, no matter how hard you try.”</p>

<p>Varna swooped up from the canyon to land next to them, grinning widely. “What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think you’ve found a gem here,” Shadimon replied. “You explored the caves?”</p>

<p>“Some of them, yes.” Varna sat on the lip of the cliff, swinging his legs. “Most of them are pretty small, but several are easily as big as a house. It shouldn’t be hard to clean up the bigger ones, and we could expand the smaller ones.” He grinned and shrugged, “Nothing fell when we messed with the rock, so I guess it’s stable enough? Nothing in them, either. We found some nests and debris, and I think a section further south is used by eagles, but that’s it. No signs of people or anything bigger.”</p>

<p>He hesitated a little, “Though...did you notice the palisade across the river? We were in a hurry, but…”</p>

<p>“Palisade…I saw some debris in the river, but didn’t notice anything unusual. You investigated?”</p>

<p>“We did, yes, and it was deliberately built and deliberately torn down.”</p>

<p>Baijani crossed her arms, “No one knows exactly how wide-spread the empire was, or how many places they crammed their noses into. Could have been a patch of resistance here, or maybe just some people who didn’t bow fast enough. We’ll continue scouting around and find out soon enough.” She looked out into the canyon, watching people exploring some of the caves and exclaiming over the views. After a few moments, she stepped off the cliff and glided to the other side.</p>

<p>“You think she’s ok?” Varna’s voice was much more somber than usual.</p>

<p>Shadimon looked down at the younger elf, “Are any of us?”</p>

<hr/>

<p>A week of dusty work saw most of the larger caves swept out and tidied up, a task that resulted in intermittent rains of dust and debris that made flying through the canyon exciting. It was hard, dirty work, but being in a set place meant they could all wash properly, so no one minded too much. They could also see the results of their labors as caves were turned into rough living spaces. There was some fortuitous anarchy in which caves got attention; a group or family would choose one that suited them and claim it, handling the tidying themselves. There were surprisingly few squabbles, most of which didn’t even need outside mediation.</p>

<p>By common consent, the largest usable cave was turned into public space. They continued the habit of communal meals; everyone knew their supplies were marginal, and a large meal gave them all a chance to relax and talk to friends who had maybe been working on different projects. Food was stored and dispensed from what was jokingly called Town Hall, and everyone could scatter from there. </p>

<p>With the building underway, Shadimon sent their scouts out. Some were patrolling the immediate area, while others were sent further out to begin properly mapping the canyons. Dhakamari, one of their former rangers, led a small group further up the canyon, while Varna kept an eye on the close-range scouts. </p>

<p>Most of the work in the canyon was focused on getting things habitable. Rough stone outcrops were carefully smoothed, floors were leveled, and cave mouths were widened. Though working stone was new, many people jumped into it with enthusiasm and determination to experiment. There were a few exciting moments where a section collapsed, but no one was injured. The scouts reported stands of conifers nearby, and the addition of wood went a very long way toward making the caves feel like homes. Unofficial city planning started happening, with people plotting out locations for walkways and bridges, and even inspecting sheer parts of the cliffs for further development.</p>
 
<p>It didn’t take long for decorations to start appearing. Rough pigment was easy to come by in such a vibrant canyon, and swatches of paint and colorful streamers slowly began marking homes. The winged elves had always firmly believed that, if a plain item would do, a decorated one was better. Wooden posts and doors and roofs were painted or carved, and streaks continued out onto the rock itself. Detailed stone carving was proving a challenge, but at least two people were practicing the new skill.</p>

<p>“Has Dhakamari checked in recently?” Shadimon asked one evening. The four leaders regularly gathered for evening meals, taking the time to update each other on their respective work. Anasatri was usually the most effusive, always moving, fluttering from one topic to another, but she had a stunning memory and an intense love for people that kept her right in the middle of things. Baijani was quieter and more terse; she was very direct with her comments, and preferred to listen more than speak.</p>

<p>Varna soaked up a bit of sauce with a piece of bread, “Not yet, no. He was planning on going back the way we came. Get a closer look at that palisade and try to get this whole canyon mapped.”</p>

<p>Shadimon frowned, “It’s been...what, almost two weeks? Surely they should have at least left a message?”</p>

<p>Varna shrugged, but looked uneasy, “He was supposed to, but they may have gone further out than expected.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to just assume things are alright…”</p>

<p>“The scouts are still reporting nothing unusual. Don’t know what more we can do here, besides just keep watch.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>It was another several days before the rangers reported back. Shadimon was at the top of the eastern cliff helping the group cutting wood when someone pointed out the approaching fliers. He recognized Dhakamari in the lead, and a quick count showed that all of them were accounted for, but their wingbeats were erratic and labored.</p>

<p>Shadimon dropped off the cliff down to the ledge in front of Town Hall and waved them down with arms and wings. By now, others had seen them and a small crowd was gathering. The rangers came in too fast, skidding and bumbling into each other, and most of them sat down as soon as they came to a stop. Shadimon was pleased to see people immediately moving forward to offer them water, and heard Baijani sending others for food. </p>

<p>Most of the scouts went flat on the ground after drinking, an untidy, exhausted sprawl of feathers. Shadimon crouched across from Dhakamari, waiting for the ranger to drink and pour the remaining water over his head. “A full report can wait, but is there anything we need to know immediately?”</p>

<p>Dhakamari shook his head, raking wet hair out of his eyes, “No immediate danger, no, but there’s a lot to tell…”</p>

<p>“Then it can wait. Rest here, if you aren’t up to finding where your families have settled. We can talk tomorrow.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>Dhakamari made his report the following evening to the leaders and a few curious bystanders who politely refused to be shooed away. He still looked exhausted, and there were hollows in his cheeks and throat that spoke of hard work and short rations. An impressive amount of game meat had been donated to get the rangers back on their feet, but it was going to take time and rest.</p>
 
<p>“We started going south. We wanted to see how close we are to the head of the canyon, and if there are any other side canyons up there. Closer to the fall, on the other side of the canyon, we found...what’s left of another settlement.” He had paled under his dusky skin, “There were bodies. Maybe three hundred people, humans and elves. Everything had been burned and destroyed. We made a rough map of it, but we...we couldn’t stay there long.” Anasatri moved closer so she could lean against him.</p>

<p>“After that, we looked at some side canyons and the tops of the cliffs for about a day in either direction, and headed back north.” He nodded toward the scoutmaster, “Varna already told you about the palisade across the river. We investigated that again; if we want to rebuild it, that narrow part of the canyon is a good place for fortifications. But what’s there was very definitely torn apart. Intensely.” He swallowed, “Anyway. After that we holed up for a little while. That big storm came rolling through, and we settled in to wait it out. There’s a spire not far past the palisade with some overhangs and a stunning view. </p>

<p>“We were watching the storm, and Anaya noticed that one of the embankments was starting to crumble. It was slowing down a lot of water, and we knew it was going to cause a flash flood if it went.” He looked up, meeting Shadimon’s eyes, “I gave the order to abandon our mission, and I take full responsibility for that. We dropped everything we could spare and flew downriver. We made it in time to warn the river elves. The flotilla took some damage, but there weren’t many casualties. We stayed with them for a few days looking for the people and rafts that got swept away.”
He sighed, shoulders sagging, “After that we came back immediately. I know we’re late, and we didn’t finish our job-”</p>

<p>“Mari! Why in Her name would we be angry at you? Were any of you hurt? The flotilla was alright when you left them? Do you think we should send people back down to check on them?”</p>

<p>Dhakamari blinked, “I...no, none of us were hurt. The river elves said they had things under control. They were already repairing the damage when we left. It probably wouldn’t hurt to check back in? Maybe to...tell them what we found, and tell them to be careful.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. Varna, if you’ll handle it please?”</p>

<p>“Wait,” Dhakamari interrupted, “May I go?” He grimaced, “It would make the whole thing feel less like a failure…”</p>

<p>“I understand, but I’m going to need you here.” Shadimon shuffled through the maps they had brought back, “I’ll need you and your rangers to scout that settlement and the area around it. Varna’s scouts can keep an eye on things until you’ve recovered.”</p>
