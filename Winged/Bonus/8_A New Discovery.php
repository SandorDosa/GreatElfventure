<h1>A New Discovery</h1>

<p><i>"The Watchtower is a potential resource we&rsquo;d be stupid to ignore. It&rsquo;s such a landmark, according to the maps, and the descriptions make it sound damn near unclimbable. Investigate, explore, and see what there is to see."</i></p>

<p>Dhakamari flew at the head of his wing of rangers. They had taken maybe a bit longer to arrive than was strictly necessary, but just one day of detouring through the darkwood forest had been an excellent morale boost for all of them. The Watchtower itself had been visible since they left the canyon system, looming out at the edge of the mountain range. The maps they had were very limited, and had little actual information on the huge monument.</p>

<p>As they approached, there were no signs of activity around the base of the tower. They found a river flowing out of the mountains, and one of the rangers supposed it was the other end of the one they found closer to their canyon. If so, it could be a useful thoroughfare for dark elves in the future. The top of the tower also looked empty, but Dhakamari wanted them to approach slowly.</p>

<p>They took their time to explore around the base, and to rest before making the flight to the top. When they reached it, they found a broad, nearly flat plateau. They spread out in a long line, keeping the scouts to either side just within sight, and started a sweep toward the center of the plateau. It looked more or less like the same terrain they had seen on the ground: rocky, scrubby, and various shades of brown. Dhakamari, in the center of the line, noticed an oddly regular shape in the rocks up ahead. He flashed a hand signal to the scouts on either side of him, and they passed it down to the others.</p>

<p>The shape quickly resolved into a two-story building, and Dhakamari angled up, getting higher just in case. The higher vantage also brought gouges in the ground into abrupt relief: a massive holy symbol of Luna was carved into the rock in front of the building.</p>

<p>As they circled for another pass, they spotted huge columns surrounding the building, many of which had collapsed or eroded. The building itself was sturdy stone and earth - very similar to how the winged elves were building on the cliff tops - with a large dome on one end. As they continued to circle, they saw no signs of life. Dhakamari flashed another hand signal to his scouts, and slowly glided down toward the front door.</p>

<p>The door itself was sturdy wood, but the dry air and sand-laden wind hadn't been kind to it. It opened with minimal struggle onto a broad, dim hall. The building was silent, and there was a building layer of dust on everything. Relatively confident that it was abandoned, Dhakamari waved the other scouts down, and they set to cautiously exploring the building. It looked more like an abbey than a military outpost, with modest communal living spaces, study rooms, and empty shelves for scrolls.</p>

<p>One the second floor, they found meager living quarters, empty of all personal belongings. Under the dome, they found...something. A tangle of brass gears and rings littered the floor, all carved with intricate runes. Mixed in the brass were spheres made of stone or metal, and glass lenses. A large crystal formed the base of the structure, and the windows in the room were lined with telescopes.</p>

<p>"What is that thing?"</p>

<p>"Something to do with the sky, probably stars? That was important to them."</p>

<p>One of the scouts peered into a telescope, "These at least look like they're in one piece. Certainly can't turn down good telescopes."</p>

<p>Back on the first floor, tucked into a corner, they found a door down into a basement. After a pause to light torches, they crept down the stairs. The room they found was huge, and every surface was carved into stone shelves and packed full of scrolls. The shelves filled the room, all meticulously labeled and absolutely incomprehensible. They appeared to be star charts, hundreds, maybe thousands of them.</p>

<p>"Hey Mari...you should see this..."</p>

<p>Back by the stairs, one of the others had found a small room. It had a tiny, makeshift bed, a small chest, and some dessicated plants. On the bed was the body of a Lycan woman, a wereowl. "Been awhile, looks like," the scout said quietly. The woman was very old, and looked to have died in her sleep. Her wings were folded around her body, and her face looked tired and sad. "We should...do something," the scout said hesitantly.</p>

<p>"We should," Dhakamari agreed. The others had come to see what they were looking at, and all of them went quiet at the sight of the body. "Shouldn't we?" Dhakamari said a little louder.</p>

<p>All of them nodded, some reluctantly, but they all agreed. When they started to wrap the body in a blanket, they found a piece of paper in her hand. Dhakamari squinted at it, "This is in Skaplyndi. I can speak it a little, but not read it really. Any of you?"</p>

<p>One of the others took it, skimming over it and muttering while the rest gently wrapped the body and started to take it upstairs. "Hey Mari, before you get any further up there, you should hear this." She cleared her throat, and started to read.</p>

<p><i>To the one who finds my remains</p>

<p>My fellows said they would return in a few months once the war was over. I never saw them again. The last supply delivery was eleven years ago. I do not need to be a prophet to know what happened.</p>

<p>I have devoted my life to Luna and the stars, and they tell me all I need to know. The signs are clear. All of my calculations and divinations agree. The Lycan Empire has been destroyed. The age of the Wolf has closed. It was destined to happen someday. This is not what turns my spirit to ash.</p>

<p>Luna has stopped speaking to me. Once, I could hear her voice faintly in my dreams every night. Sometimes even while awake, when close to deciphering a pattern, I could hear her. Now, only silence. I still see her cross the sky every night, I still calculate her phases and movements, yet I hear nothing. For years I have been desperately begging for her to speak to me, but my despair receives no acknowledgement.</p>

<p>Why did she abandon us?</p>

<p>This question became my only reason for living. I don't eat much. Simple fare gathered from the land. I ate only as much as I needed and devoted myself fully to the question. Meditating, praying, spending hour after hour examining the infinite mystery of the stars.</p>

<p>Now, as I feel my life ebb away, I finally understand.</p>

<p>We failed her. Utterly. We failed to become what we were destined to become. We were not the children that our mother chose us to be. Now, we fade. I cannot read our future. Perhaps we will disappear and our mother will die, perhaps things come in cycles and we will be able to try again. I do not know. The stars won't show me that.</p>

<p>I do know a few things about you. The stars showed me that much. I know this age will belong to you. I know you suffered great crimes at the hands of my people. I know you despise me. I will not ask you for forgiveness. We have neither earned it nor need it.</p>

<p>I will ask, no beg of you two things. The dying wishes of a sad old woman.</p>

<p>First, please send my soul to Luna. I have not the strength.</p>

<p>Second, like this new age, this observatory now belongs to you. This building and the archive beneath it contains my life's work. I know you have no reason to value anything created by one so deservedly hated as me, but please do not let it be wasted.</p>

<p>Thank you. Viss Heita, Oracle of Luna</p></i>

<p>The scouts were quiet, and at least two were visibly holding back tears. "What did she mean, send her soul to Luna?"</p>

<p>"Cremation," the translator murmured. "They believe that releases their soul."</p>

<p>"It'll take time, not a lot of wood up here. We should get started on that. We're...going to, right?"</p>

<p>Dhakamari nodded firmly, "Of course we are. Probably best to do it at night, and it doesn't have to be right this moment. Let's do some sketches of the building, and pick a few of those scrolls to take back with us. Anasatri and Baijani are going to want to know about this place. We can prepare a pyre tomorrow."</p>

<p>They set up camp in what appeared to have been an eating hall. Some of the furniture they found had started to fall apart, so they dragged it to the entryway to go into the pyre for the keeper. One of the youngest scouts was picking at his meal, "Do you ever wonder...what they saw? They have all those telescopes up there..."</p>

<p>Someone else grimaced, "It was all religious stuff for them. Seems weird to me, staring at your god? Watching what She's doing every night and making notes about it? Isn't that a little...voyeuristic?"</p>

<p>"To us it's just the moon," the first scout said, defensive. "But ignoring that, what about the stars? Do they know what stars look like up close? Look at all those charts in there; we know that people navigate by stars, but the night sky isn't something we know much about."</p>

<p>"No, because night is for sleeping, not flying. That's not a safe sky. Especially when the Lycan god is staring back at you."</p>

<p>"Why worry about what someone else's god is or isn't doing?"</p>

<p>"We're worrying about that by setting up a Lycan burial."</p>

<p>"That's honoring someone's last wishes, and that's just what decent people do."</p>

<p>The conversation looked like it was going to start getting more heated, so Dhakamari stood up. "Let's go find out." He led them up to the observatory, lit only by the moonlight coming through the windows. He picked a telescope at random and peered through it. It wasn't pointed at the moon, but at a seemingly-random patch of stars. To his eyes, it looked like a smudge, but through the telescope, it lit up and resolved into a dozen stars of all colors. They all exclaimed over the colors of the stars, and the glittering dust trail that went across the sky. Someone finally got a telescope focused on the moon, and they all took turns looking at the face of a god.</p>

<p>Everyone was quiet when they went back to their makeshift camp.</p>

<p>The following day, they got to work breaking up damaged furniture and collecting woody scrub to make something like a pyre. Coming back inside, Dhakamari found the scout who translated the letter crouching next to the Lycan's body. She looked up at him, and held up a long sooty grey feather. "She was a Loremaster," she said, her jaw set stubbornly. "That deserves respect our way as well as theirs." Dhakamari simply nodded, watching her disappear back toward their camp.</p>

<p>The following morning, after keeping the pyre going most of the night, they hung the feather, now decorated with a few beads and with the oracle's name carefully written on the rachis, in the archive room.</p>
