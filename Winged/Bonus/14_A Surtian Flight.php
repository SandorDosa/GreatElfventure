<h1>A Surtian Flight</h1>

<p>The Flying Elves are offered the top floor of a two-story villa, set in the hillside overlooking most of Surt -- a wide town of flat-topped buildings built from brown, red, and white stone and concrete. Many buildings (including the villa) have open patios exposed to the outside, roofed with thick, angular columns of concrete and stone. All of the buildings are topped with plantlife -- not just vegetation, but full gardens, vineyards, and farms across the roofs of every single building in Surt -- and this includes the villa itself, though the vines and fruit trees sitting atop it are mostly out of season at this point. Conveniently, the villa’s rooftop has been marked with a sign reading “Flying Elf Delegation: Your Villa is Here”.</p>
<p>From the air, the streets of Surt in daylight fairly organized and reasonably busy. Outside the city, the smell of sulfur and brimstone is a major irritant; inside, the plantlife covering the rooftops seems to filter out the smell, as long as you stay less than twenty feet above it. </p>
<p>The villa’s interior has been decorated with frescoes, colorful carpets, and braziers full of teal flames. The Hunger is waiting as the Flappies arrive, accompanied by someone whom the Flappies could tell, even at a glance, was most likely a butler.</p>
<p>The scout group consists of six winged elves, led by a young man with striking blue and black wings. Hunger would recognize this as Varna, the Scoutmaster, possibly from in person meetings, possibly just from hearsay. They’re all carrying light packs and look around curiously as Varna approaches Hunger with a big grin on his face, “Hello! We weren’t expecting such a fancy welcome!” </p>
<p>"Varna, I presume," the Hunger says, with a big mask on his face. He offers a handshake, and then continues. "You're doing our fair nation a favor; it seems only appropriate to be as hospitable to you as we can."</p>
<p>He turns to the butler, and nods. The butler wanders back into one of the other rooms.</p>
<p>"And let me emphasize that this is a rather important and dangerous favor you're doing for us," the Hunger says. "Our own teams have not had a lot of luck exploring our surroundings. There have been... rockslides, fumarole explosions, lava bubbles, toxic gas vents, toxic gas firestorms... not to mention signs of Lycan activity... Its really quite fortunate that you'll be able to avoid most of those by staying airborne."</p>
<p>The butler strolls back in, carrying a large tray laden with food -- some kind of cheesecakes, fancy breads stamped with various artistic symbols, sliced bread coated in cheese and jam, and large jars full of a sweet-and-fermented-smelling beverage. He places the tray down on a nearby table.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Herbert," the Hunger says. "Herbert here will be managing your villa while you're here. And, by all means, dig in; my understanding was that it was a rather long flight." </p>
<p>The scouts descended on the platter, exclaiming over the variety. Varna helped himself to a slice of bread, “We certainly noticed a lot of uh, interesting activity while we were flying over. The air is nasty in a lot of places, but it doesn’t go up too high. Have you figured out any ways to cut down on that? Don’t know that tying a cloth over our faces will be quite enough, and we’ll have to go lower to really do a proper job.” He finished the bread, licking jam off of his fingers, “If not, we can make fast enough passes to be all right. There are ways to get a good look at dangerous territory.” </p>
<p>The cheese is soft and tasty, but definitely would be better melted. The Hunger shook his head. "I'm afraid our lovely gardens are our only real method for clearing the air in the general vicinity. We've noticed the air tends to be clearer near large spots of wild vegetation, and at higher elevations, but unfortunately that's about it." </p>
<p>“Ah well, we can work with that. Shadimon said that you were wanting us to look at specific places? Do you have a map or general description? The map we have of the entire area is um, terrible. It has the Maar on it. Sort of. There are question marks.”</p>
<p>"We do," the Hunger says. He pulls a thin roll of parchment out of a scrollcase at his side, and hands Varna a wide, thin map, depicting Surt and a few areas to the south and west. "We've marked out what we've successfully explored, and marked your target areas in purple."</p>
<p>It’s worth noting there is not a lot on the map itself.</p>
<p>He gestures to a long strand of purple heading west-north-west of Surt itself. "We've detected a large deposit of potentially valuable metal somewhere in this general region. Its over a more mountainous area, so it may be somewhat easier to explore. The deposit should be around here." He gestures to a spot at the far end of the strand.</p>
<p>Then he gestures to a large purple blotch directly southwest of Surt. "This area goes directly onto the Maar itself, and may be a bit more dangerous. We're hoping you will be able to find a reasonable enough spot to build a dock, so we can establish the river connection more properly, and get around some of the issues of traveling through the Maar."</p>
<p>Finally, he gestures to the area due south of Surt. "The Terror is going to lead her own scouting party here. We've tried unsuccessfully to scout that area several times; the Terror plans to try again. If you have any issues exploring the southwestern area, you might be able to meet up with her team in an emergency." </p>
<p>One of the other scouts, taller and with ruddy brown wings, comes over and takes a small wax tablet out of his bag. “So that southwestern area is likely to be the most dangerous?” He scribbled some notes on the tablet, “Probably best to save that for last, then, unless the other group is going south immediately?”</p>
<p>Varna peered at the map, “You’re sending the Terror? What, are you hoping she’ll be able to intimidate the volcanoes into behaving?” </p>
<p>The Hunger chuckled. "To be honest, I think she's frustrated -- mostly by the lack of progress, but we already called off one pathfinding expedition due to Lycan activity, and I suspect she is concerned about letting the Lycans bottle us up in the name of security.</p>
<p>"...Well, I say Lycans, plural. We've determined that the "massacred camp" -- that's the spot to the southeast there -- was most likely the actions of the Tourist. My understanding is that she isn't making a habit of attacking elves, so you should be safe. Please keep an eye out anyway; we've seen sightings of an unknown group riding dire wolves in this area as well.</p>
<p>"The Terror plans on setting out immediately, but I suspect they'll be trying to scout that area for some time. The ground there is quite treacherous, and our previous progress up to this point has been slow."</p>
<p>“Ah, that does make sense. Shadimon does the same thing, taking patrols around the canyons. I think that’s mostly boredom and lingering paranoia.”</p>
<p>“Not so lingering,” the red-feathered elf muttered. “Not after that lecture about no one catching dreamdust elves climbing the cliffs.” He glanced up at Hunger, “I’m Indriani, by the way. You said dire wolves; do you think it might have to do with those…’wolf elves’ the dark elves reported?”</p>
<p>"Likely," the Hunger said. "It could easily have been deserters from the Empire's armies, as with the camp to the southeast, but the camp there did not show any signs of wolves. I expect their 'Wolf Elf' is a Lycan, or maybe a scout for a small band of them. We've been working to increase our security just in case." </p>
<p>“Hopefully we won’t see anyone out there,” Varna shrugged, “but if we do, we’ll let you know about it. So if we head to that northwest area first...oh wait, that reminds me.” He dug in his bag and came up with a palm-sized lump of copper. “Shadimon wanted to send this along. He knew you were hoping for copper, and we’re starting to get some kind of actual mining set up. So here’s a small piece so you can look at it, check the quality, whatever you’re supposed to do with metal, I don’t know. And if you can come up with, I don’t know, an estimation of what or how much you’d need? We can take that back home with us. Right, back to what I know about…” He shifted and resettled his wings, very nearly clipping Hunger, “So northwest, mountains, some kind of mineral deposits. Normally we camp while we’re out, but if the air really does turn out to be a problem, we’ll have to come back here.” He longingly eyed the plate of food the rest of his scouts had decimated, “I’m assuming we can count on resupplying?”</p>
<p>"Of course," the Hunger said, eyeing the lump of copper with interest. "You're our guests here. Feel free to explore the town, as well; the inn is quite popular."</p>
<p>"Now, if you don't mind, I have some alchemy to work on." He dropped the copper lump into a pouch. "I'll leave you in Herbert's capable hands. Good luck!"</p>
<p>The Hunger wandered off, aiming for a set of stairs set towards the back of the villa's open patio.</p>
<p>Herbert the butler visibly relaxed as soon as the Hunger was out of eyesight. "Whoop, glad that's over with. Welcome, folks! I'm Phillomaximus Herbert, most folks call me Herb, and I'll be butlering for you guys for as long as you're here. Anything in particular you want? Looks like the Plakouscake was popular; I should have a few more in stock downstairs."</p>
<p>One of the other scouts laughed, “After flying all day, anything is delicious. We were expecting, I don’t know, trail rations? But hey, you have bread, so we’re already sold.”</p>
<p>Varna grabbed the last slice of cheese out from under someone’s hand, “We’ll more than happily take whatever food is available. We do have rations with us, but if you have things that can be packed up and taken out with us? There’s a lot to be said for fresh food. And this...villa? Is for us to use? That seems like an awful lot of trouble for just some scouts, but appreciated!” </p>
<p>Herb nodded. "Its all yours, though fair warning the bottom floor is mostly cellars and gardening supplies. There's a cistern from the aqua via towards the back. If you want to take a bath, let me know, and I'll heat up some water in the fire pit first. I definitely recommend heating it first -- the water's probably ice cold.</p>
<p>"As for the villa itself... I know the boss is trying to be impressive, but its kind of cheating in this case, because this is technically his villa. I've never seen him actually use it, because frankly I think he lives in his office.</p>
<p>"Anyway, yeah, I've got a good selection of bread, cheese, and jerky that should be pretty nice to travel on. The Triumvirate's given me a pretty decent stipend. And if there's anything special you need from in the city, or anything that you want -- souvenirs, a trip to the tavern, a musician or two -- well, going into town and getting stuff for you guys is a pretty easy part of my job, and I'm more than happy to help.</p>
<p>"Try some of the pulque, by the way." He gestured to the jars full of sweet-smelling fermented liquid. "It’s a little alcoholic, but it’s great for traveling on. Doesn't go bad easily, stays cool, and really fills you with energy."</p>
<p>One of the scouts took a sip, widened her eyes, and attempted to surreptitiously sneak the entire jar off the table.</p>
<p> “Can we wander around town?” Indriani asked. “It’s probably best if we wait a day or two before leaving to rest-”</p>
<p>“‘Rest’ he says after proposing exploring an entire new city-”</p>
<p>“And we’d like to see what you’ve all done up here! Despite, apparently, toxic firestorms…”</p>
<p>“A guide would be great, but if you have other things to do…”</p>
<p>Herbert observes that somehow that was a more or less coherent train of thought split between four people. They seem to actually be more communicative when excited. "Nope, being a guide is *also* part of my a butler. We can head out whenever you're ready. And don't worry too much about the toxic firestorms. That doesn't happen as often the boss made it out to be. I think the pathfinders here are just really bloody unlucky."</p>

Remaining witnesses dropped at Triumvirate request<br/>
<br/>
Charges: DROPPED AT TRIUMVIRATE REQUEST<br/>
<br/>
Description:<br/>
KIRKEGARD and BROWNSTONE called to handle reports of trespassing, petty theft, criminal loitering. Traced path of criminal activity to THE HOWL, whereupon encountered PHILLOMAXIMUS HERBERT and FLAPPY SCOUTING DETACHMENT. Barfight ensued during brief interrogation; KIRKEGARD and BROWNSTONE lost contact with suspects while rounding up barfight participants. K&B called in for backup and additional command support, at which point DOUKAS sent in a Triumvirate Special Orders request and ordered STORMBADGER and DANDELION to pursue along with K&B, with orders to diplomatically ameliorate criminal activity.<br/>
<br/>
TRIUMVIRATE special orders received: ameliorate criminal activity with extreme leniency, as FLAPPY SCOUTING DETACHMENT are to be considered foreign officials providing service to state. Calculate and ameliorate damages as needed. DOUKAS notes at this point that damages reported are fairly minor, and could be likely classified as "youthful exuberance" according to the official financial damages chart, where guardian-ad-litem to be considered HERBERT.<br/>
<br/>
Next contact engaged by MOOSELEAF AND GRASSMITH, who encountered the FLAPPY SCOUTING DETACHMENT observing a Firedancer adulthood ritual. M&G stayed in area to assure safety of FLAPPY SCOUTING DETACHMENT, provided some medical aid when firedancer ritual went slightly out of control [limited damage, see p5]. Were attending to medical aid when nearby FIREBRANDS engaged in argument with HERBERT and FSD, which escalated to violence when some HONEST LASSES (at least one in uniform) and ASSORTED ASHEN intervened on FSD's behalf. Some damage localized to Firedancer stand and a few merchant stands [see p6].<br/>
<br/>
Conflict ended when STORMBADGER, DANDELION, KIRKEGARD, AND BROWNSTONE arrived on scene. Support too limited to catch all perpetrators [see p2], but successfully escorted HERBERT and FSD to CONSTABULARY STATION IOTA. Upon arrival, DOUKAS released HERBERT and FSD with no charges, but with a reminder that it is in the interests of both nations that relations stay relatively friendly. VIVA SURT</p>
