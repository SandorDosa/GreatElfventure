<h1>A Training Montage</h1>

<p>After the attack on Asavardi, there had been an undercurrent of anger throughout the village. When the blade elves made their offer of military training, Shrike had known exactly what to do with that restless energy. Baijani had given the entire project to her, and she dove into it, grateful for an outlet for her own restlessness.</p>

<p>The hard part hadn’t been finding volunteers, it had been selecting the right ones. Shrike had spent days making her choices, picking the steadier personalities and stronger arms. A lot could be done in training, but Shrike knew very well what would yield the best results for them all, and took care to ensure that her decisions were explained well enough to avert any hard feelings.</p>

<p>Shrike looks back at the wing following her as she tilts her wings into a tight spiral down to Fort Alfyr. They’re all flying in a loose formation that quickly closes together as they follow her lead down to the ground. Their approach had been very obvious, and she sees a small welcoming committee waiting for them on the parade ground. Lifting her hand to signal the others, she banks to a neat landing in front of the blade elves, folding her wings smartly and listening to her people forming up behind her. Her salute isn’t nearly as precise as the blade elf standard, nor is the infectious grin, but she doesn’t seem to care much. “Skyhawk Wing, reporting for training!”</p>

<p>Grandmaster Ehra Indrek returns the salute smartly with a stoic expression, "At ease, Shrike."</p>

<p>Today, he is not the warm grandfather Shrike has met before. Instead, he has the practiced discipline and calm of his rank as Grandmaster. He walks slowly in front of the recruits, looking them over with a critical eye.</p>

<p>"If you were blade elf recruits," he speaks, "this is the point where we would remove all your belongings, shave your heads, and place you in barracks for months of drilling, verbal abuse, and extreme physical stress. We do this to break down our recruits, so that we may build them into a unit. An individual is never prepared for war, for the horrors it contains. We reforge individuals into a cohesive whole, stronger than any one of them could ever be. This is how blade elf training works, how we acquire our famous discipline and courage."</p>

<p>He stops and looks back at the group, "You aren't blade elves. I could do that to you, yes. When you returned home, to pass on what you have learned to others, that training method would not continue. Winged elves don't think like that. You have a different approach to discipline, order, rank, even the very concept of warfare."</p>

<p>He walks back and addresses Shrike directly, "To that end, we will be learning from you as much as teaching. We are not here to turn you into blade elves. We are here to find out how a winged elf can become a soldier, to secure safety for future generations. Our war scholars will be learning as much as teaching."</p>

<p>He stops in front of her and looks her in the eyes, "Shrike, there is no one else alive who knows more about the ways in which blade and winged elf martial philosophy interact. Your individual drive created a unique fighting style unlike any other. We are now asking you to help us do the same, but on the scale of armies. You will need to be able to communicate freely with the war scholars, to exchange ideas and concepts freely as an individual and an equal. By right of my rank as Grandmaster, I will grant you the authority to do so with respect."</p>

<p>He holds a hand out to her with the slightest hint of his grandfatherly smile, "Congratulations, Master Shrike."</p>

<p>Shrike stares, her wings dipping before she snaps them back into position. Then she grins and takes his hand, “Thank you, Grandmaster. I’ll do my best.” </p>

<hr/>

<p>There had been an astonishing amount of construction at the Fort since any of the winged elves had last been there. The barracks they were taken to were clearly new and very spacious. The furnishings were simple, but well made, with a bed, storage chest, and shelf for each recruit. Shrike let her charges sort themselves out while she inspected the separate quarters for officers.</p> 

<p>The furnishings were functionally identical, though she did notice the bed looked a little bit nicer, and there was also a small desk and chair. She stood in the doorway for a moment, listening to the voices from down the hall, before deciding to use the separate quarters. I want them all to stick with each other, not just me. Having me constantly hovering over them would get very old very fast, and I don’t need that kind of resentment. </p>

<p>It felt very good to slide her pack off and drop it on the storage chest. Winged elves traveled light by necessity, but planning to spend months away from home required more careful preparation. They had brought carry nets with them with bulkier group supplies like their tents, food, and cooking gear, and each individual was responsible for their personal things. Still, several months’ worth of things meant a heavy double-pack.</p>

<p>Keeping one ear on the hallway, she started to unpack her things and stow them neatly away. <i>Neatness is one thing we’re going to have to talk about. Not as fanatical as the blades are, but it won’t take long before people’s things start getting mixed up and in the wrong places.</i> She paused, <i>I wonder how long it’ll take before they start pushing beds together to sleep in groups. Certainly nothing I’m going to discourage as long as they keep it neat. The drill masters will have a fit though.</i></p>

<p>She paused again, holding her grooming kit, <i>The other masters. <b>I’m</b> a Master. I...am a Master.</i> She set the kit down and sat on the bed, thinking. <i>I didn’t expect it. No, that’s not quite it. I didn’t expect the promotion, certainly, but I didn’t expect it to...matter. I’m not a blade elf; I’m not even a part of their military.</i></p>

<p>As if on cue, she heard her mother’s voice clearly in her mind, <i>People like to be acknowledged, love. Even when you do something for others, with no thought for yourself, it’s good to be seen, ah? Remember that, when people do for you.</i></p>

<p>“Not exactly situationally appropriate there,” Shrike muttered, “but I’ll take it. I’ll take it, and I’ll do the best I can with it.” The weight of responsibility settled abruptly on her shoulders as she really realized just what she was doing, and a brief spike of panic set her feathers on end. <i>I’m not ready! I’ve never led before! I don’t know how…</i></p>

<p>But she did. From her own peoples’ stories, from watching Shadimon, and her mother. From the blade elves, and even Lock and the other human commanders during the war. <i>Knowing and doing are different things, but it’s a place to start.</i></p>

<hr/>

<p>“JAAKOB!”</p>

<p>The blade elf had just enough time for traumatic flashbacks before Shrike cannoned into his back, sending him sprawling. <i>Not as hard as before; she’s gotten better at controlling her speed.</i></p>

<p>Winged elves are lightweight for their size, but Shrike is still a solid amount of weight planted on his back. “And to think. I was just getting able to go outside without reflexively looking up every few steps,” he sighed.</p>

<p>Shrike laughed and got off, helping him up and dusting off his sleeves, “That won’t do, will it! Who knows when some kind of flying enemy might appear again? Like you always said: Constant-”</p>

<p>“Vigilance,” he finished with another sigh. “Yes, and never have any of my students turned my words on me quite like you.”</p>

<p>He stepped back and eyed her critically up and down, “And I hear congratulations are in order. Back with recruits of your own, even.”</p>

<p>She nodded sharply, squaring her shoulders, “We’re not going to lose our home again, especially not to <i>bandits</i>. They’re good. I want us to be better.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>“That’s the hard part,” Shrike said, resting her arms on the table. “We don’t so much have a martial philosophy. I mean, sure we have ways of doing things, but it’s not...official like yours is. No one has sat down and said ‘this is how we will do things’. The Harriers didn’t exist before the War, and all of their training was...for lack of a better term, on the fly. Hunting tactics that got repurposed.”</p>

<p>She stretched her wings; they had been at this table for longer than she cared for, going over and over ways of trying to blend blade elf and winged elf teachings on a larger scale. “Even me coming to you. That was a unique set of circumstances that we’re probably not going to see again. I hope not, anyway,” she finished with a mutter.</p>

<p>“You do have a martial art, do you not?” Master Olavi asked. “Does that not come with an attendant philosophy? When and how to use it?”</p>

<p>Shrike made a vague hand gesture, “Yes and no. Most people practice it more for the agility and stamina than the ability to kick someone’s ass. It’s seen more as a dance style. It’s not a military thing; plenty of civilians know the basics, and plenty of the fighters don’t. You’ve seen me demonstrate it. It’s about avoidance and momentum, not standing and trading punches. I know it, and incorporated it into what you taught me, and I looked for people who did have the basics down to give us something of a common starting point.”</p>

<p>“The key thing,” Master Kaja said, steeping her fingers, “is the sense of unity. I think, when you take everything else away, that is the fundamental base. It’s what gives us our strength, knowing that the people in our unit will hold our lives as important as their own.” She gestured at Shrike, “Is this a focus for you as well?”</p>

<p>“Yes…” Shrike said slowly, drawing the word out. “But again not...officially. It’s part of our culture, that sense of tight community. Our scouts and rangers train in teams, which shuffle regularly so everyone learns they can rely on anyone else in the scout corps. It’s even in the way we fly. You saw us coming in, we fly in V-formation like birds. That’s actually easier than any other way. The person in the front takes the brunt of the air, and the people behind can follow in the wake they create. It rotates so everyone takes a turn with the harder job.” She floundered for a moment, “It’s...more a sense of doing your share. Flight exercises, team training scenarios, those would be good places to start.”</p>

<p>Master Jaakob shook his head, “Not start. We need to start out of combat scenarios. Kaja is right, I think, about fostering a sense of unity. Start with that, and with your martial art to get them all to the same skill and fitness level.” He eyed Shrike, “You are correct that you’re a unique situation. Have you decided how this unit will specialize?”</p>

<p>Shrike nodded, “Like I said, we don’t stand and take punches. Not only do we tend to be smaller, we’re lighter and just more fragile. Our wings are our best aspect, and ignoring them would be stupid. We’ve always specialized in distance, so I would like to focus on archers.” She grimaced, “Those who have bows brought them, but that wasn’t even a third of the unit. I don’t have one, for instance.”</p>

<p>Jaakob waved a hand, “That can be taken care of. Learning to make and care for their own weapons is another valuable skill. The ones you brought will serve as examples for the proper style. But, unit-level training for cohesion. Suggestions?”</p>

<p>Shrike looked out the window, thinking. “The martial arts exercises will help.That’s done best with a partner or in groups. Scout patrols and hunting parties as well, maybe. Get in some training for us and help your logistics in dealing with us.” She paused, “But for non-combat...honestly a great deal of that will happen on its own. You’ve got us in barracks, and I can guarantee that they’ll start entertaining themselves. Telling stories, playing games, sleeping together-”</p>

<p>Olavi frowned, “We discourage <i>fraternization</i> between recruits.”</p>

<p>Shrike waved a hand, “I mean literally, sleeping in the same bed.” She quirked her eyebrows at him, “And short of staring them down every minute, no amount of rules are going to stop people. But the point is, all of this is getting people to know and trust each other. Let them form those bonds with the people they bunk with, and make sure any training rotates them around so they can get a feel for everyone.”</p>

<p>“Another important thing to discuss,” Kaja said, “is discipline.”</p>

<p>Shrike immediately shook her head, “Your way definitely won’t fly for us. We can follow rules and be where we need to be, but the rigidity is just not something we can do. Our quarters aren’t going to be spotless, our clothes aren’t going to be pressed, and our lines aren’t going to be mathematically perfect.” She paused, grasping for words, “It’s...it’s different priorities. Those things are important to you, because it represents the...it represents how seriously you take every detail. That discipline runs through everything you do. We don’t...we just don’t think like that.”</p>

<p>She looked out the window again, tapping her fingers on the table, “Our approach is more...individual. We’re...well, flighty. We’ve worked out plenty of ways over the centuries to keep ourselves on task, and each person figures out what works best for them. We tend to either stick with one thing until we run it into the ground, or bounce between several things at once. It’s a matter of...interest. If something isn’t interesting, we have a hell of a time keeping on it.” She nodded, “The best thing is to have a selection of exercises and to rotate through them. Will help keep everyone engaged.”</p>

<p>The blade elves exchanged glances, frowning. “You make it sound like a matter of...enjoyment,” Kaja said carefully. “Discipline is doing what needs to be done, no matter the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“And we can, but it’s exhausting. Mentally.” Shrike made a frustrated sound, “It’s hard to explain, because it’s just how we are. This is a new situation for us, and it’ll just take some time to learn our way around it.” She chewed on her lip, thinking, “We didn’t even realize we did things differently until the War. Being around other people and seeing how they work, it’s weird. The things you can and can’t do. What I <i>don’t</i> want is people berating us. We’re not blade elves, and everyone knows it, but I don’t want people to treat us like we should be. We’re going to find our own ways, and you’re going to find it baffling and...who knows, lackadaisical. But we’ll get results.”</p>
