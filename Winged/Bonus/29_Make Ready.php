    <h1>Make Ready</h1>
<p>Shrike was bent over Shadimon, carefully wielding a razor on his hair. She had been somewhat surprised when he'd asked her to help him cut his hair back into a war-crest, but she agreed it was a good idea. He was sitting down in the nest, leaning back against her where she was on the main floor.</p>

<p>"Leave the center longer, if you would. I can pull it back, but I like the look a bit better."</p>

<p>"Can do. I'll do that last. Want it all the way down the back or short all around?"</p>

<p>"Short all around."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>The quiet was companionable; this was far from the first time they had enacted this ritual. Once she was done, it would be his turn to trim hers up and redo the braid, as always. She finished shaving the sides of his head and brushed the hair off her hands, "All right, how long do you-"</p>

<p>They both glanced toward the open door when a shadow crossed it, and Tathariel peeked in, squinting in the relative dimness, "Hello? Is this a good time?"</p>

<p>"Come on in," Shadimon called. "About here I think," he said to Shrike, motioning to his hair. Shrike swapped out the razor for scissors and went back to work.</p>

<p>Tathariel walked to the nest, "I brought something I've been working on, I was hoping you could help..." He trailed off as he saw what they were doing, "Oh, I'd heard there was going to be some fighting, but I thought..."</p>

<p>"There is, near Riverhaven. We're taking the Harriers and the Skyhawks for air support. The Coyotes are known for their cavalry, and we're the one group they can't hit with that on a battlefield," Shadimon said absently.</p>

<p>"I thought...is it a good idea to take all of our fighters out at once? They hit us here before."</p>

<p>Shadimon shook his head, getting an irritated noise from Shrike, "They don't have the wherewithal to hit us as well as Riverhaven, and everything they - well, <i>Coyote</i> - wants is at Riverhaven." Shadimon was looking down, so he didn't notice Tathariel's expression. Shrike, however, did.</p>

<p>She set the scissors on her knee, "You're worried. That's not unreasonable."</p>

<p>Tathariel determinedly rummaged in his bag, "Of course I am. I always worried during the War when people went out. Worried if the armor would be enough, or if there was anything I could have done better. Just worried that the enemy would get lucky at the wrong time."</p>

<p>"The Skyhawks are going to be out of range for anything the Coyotes can throw," Shadimon said comfortingly. "And the Harriers get in and out fast; we're hard to hit when we're in range."</p>

<p>"But you do have to be <i>in</i> range, and they'll probably want to get at <i>you</i>, because of how the Harriers beat them here. And how you escaped them."</p>

<p>"Possibly, but if they're looking up, they're not watching the ground forces. Really I'm much less worried about elves on horses than I ever was about Myrkyr. Elves go down easier, and horses are very easy to spook with sudden movements."</p>

<p>"Their archers will be watching though..."</p>

<p>Shadimon tilted his head, "This sounds like more than a general worry. Is someone in your family in the Harriers?"</p>

<p>Shrike covered her face, nearly clipping herself with the scissors, "Shadiiiii..."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>!" Tathariel burst out. "I'm worried about <i>you</i>! The last time you went out to fight these people, you were shot down and captured and they <i>clipped</i> your <i>wings</i>! What if that happens again? What if they pinion you this time? What if they just kill you outright?"</p>

<p>Shadimon blinked, taken aback, "Uh..."</p>

<p>"It keeps me up at night, worrying. Wondering what I'd do if we got word that you were dead. I don't <i>know</i> what I'd do. It hurts to even think about it."</p>

<p>"You...feel that strongly?"</p>

<p>"<i>Yes</i>!" Tathariel covered his face, "I think I've been in love with you since the War, but there was never time and there was too much going on and I really couldn't handle the worry with all the active fighting going on. But with us settling and when Baijani asked me to help and I got to actually just spend <i>time</i> with you..." He dragged his hands down his face, "And now I probably blew it by just dumping all of this on you when you're supposed to be getting ready to go fight, and I'm sorry I didn't mean to..."</p>

<p>Shrike put the scissors down and beckoned to Tathariel, "Come sit."</p>

<p>He started to sit down and she grabbed his wing and dragged him closer. "Now. Say all that again, but with less panic."</p>

<p>He looked up at her with wide eyes, and she made an encouraging gesture, putting her other hand on Shadimon's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I..." Tathariel swallowed, keeping his eyes on the table, "I think I've been in love with you since the War. I just didn't think anything of it, because <i>everyone</i> was." He didn't seem to notice Shadimon's muffled squawk, "Probably more like hero-worship, but again, everyone felt the same way. How could we not? But that wasn't the time. You were always looking up and ahead, and everyone knew it."</p>

<p>His voice got quieter, "But being in one place now, and seeing you able to just be...a person, not a war commander...And then coming here, just to be helpful, but getting to be around you some..." He twisted his hands together, "That's what I wanted, to just spend time with you."</p>

<p>Shadimon looked absolutely poleaxed, "I...had...no idea..."</p>

<p>Shrike ruffled his shorter hair, "Because you're <i>still</i> looking up and ahead. Poor Tathariel's been flirting with you for months."</p>

<p>&"You have??"</p>

<p>"I kept hoping you'd notice..."</p>

<p>Shadimon twisted around to look up at Shrike, "How did <i>you</i> know?"</p>

<p>"I didn't until more recently, because I haven't been around. But seeing the two of you in the same place? Very obvious."</p>

<p>Shadimon floundered for a moment, "I don't...I'm sorry, I don't have any...uh, strong feelings to confess. I <i>do</i> like you! I enjoy your company. I'm...sorry..."</p>

<p>"I know," Tathariel jumped in. "I know that. All I want...would you...be willing to give it a chance?" He took a deep breath, "I would very much like to household with the two of you."</p>

<p>"I think that's a <i>great</i> idea," Shrike said, draping her arms around their shoulders.</p>

<p>Shadimon looked up, startled, "You do??"</p>

<p>"Yes, and so do you, you just aren't admitting it yet." She tapped his chest, softening her voice, "Shadi, go with your keel, not your head."</p>

<p>Shadimon turned to look at Tathariel, who was still looking down, and his heart gave a solid thud as he really looked and realized just how attractive Tathariel was.</p>

<p><i>Especially with that blush and the tiniest hint of a smile...oh Goddess that's because of me.</i></p>

<p>Behind him, Shrike grinned and tapped Tathariel so he looked up just in time to see Shadimon's expression. She tweaked both of them on the ear,"A suggestion for you two. Kiss, get your blood moving, and stop <i>thinking</i> so hard."</p>

<p>She watched the two of them, clearly waiting for the other to make the first move, sighed, and shoved them together. Shadimon put his hands up to prevent a collision, and ended up with them pressed against Tathariel's chest. He looked up, wide-eyed, one more time, still unsure, but the look on Tathariel's face blew his doubts away. They leaned in at the same time, hesitant at first, but quickly getting more intense. Shadimon ran one of his hands up and over Tathariel's shoulder, into his hair, and made a fist at the base of his neck.</p>

<p>The <i>sound</i> Tathariel made...</p>

<p>Shadimon finally broke the kiss and leaned back, letting Tathariel breathe. He had both of his hands tangled in the other man's longer hair, and was impatiently waiting for Tathariel to get his breath back.</p>

<p>"May I suggest the bedroom?" Shrike said, and Shadimon abruptly remembered that they were still sitting between her knees. She was leaning back on her hands, smiling, "I'm thoroughly enjoying watching, but I'll leave if you'd prefer."</p>

<p>Shadimon cleared his throat, "I'd rather you stay. Tathariel?"</p>

<p>"Staying is good. Maybe...joining? If there's...more?"</p>

<p>Shadimon tightened his grip on Tathariel's hair, his voice dropping lower, "You want more?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes...<i>please</i>."</p>

<p>Shrike chuckled, "Agreed. I'll go make space; you two come when you're ready."</p>

<p>As she untangled herself and left the room, Shadimon looked back at Tathariel, "One more time, you're sure?"</p>

<p>"I&'ve never been so sure." He laughed a little, "Why are you asking <i>me</i>? I'm the one that just confessed to pining after you for years!"</p>

<p>"There's pining and then there's doing."</p>

<p>"There is, and I want both." He sighed and leaned against Shadimon's hand, "This is what I've wanted. Even if it just stays physical, I'd be satisfied."</p>

<p>"Might be less purely physical than I realized," Shadimon murmured, studying him, and the covetous look on his face was very satisfying for Tathariel.</p>

<p>"You two better not be talking yourselves out of this!" Shrike yelled from the bedroom.</p>

<p>Shadimon sighed, "You're sure you want to live with that?"</p>

<p>Tathariel blushed, "Would it be weird to admit that she's also extremely attractive, in a much more intimidating way?"</p>

<p>Shadimon blinked and burst out laughing, "Oh she's going to love you."</p>

<p>When they went into the bedroom, Shrike had shoved the pillows to the edges of the bed and was lounging comfortably against the back wall, nude. "Well? You both still have clothes on, and this is a problem."</p>

<p>Shadimon chuckled, "Shrike you're as subtle as a downdraft."But he still kicked his pants off, folding them neatly on a shelf.</p>

<p>"I'm excited. I get to watch two very pretty men have sex."</p>

<p>Shadimon raised an eyebrow at Tathariel, "Last chance to escape."</p>

<p>Tathariel's expression was somewhere between longing and disbelief, as if he still wasn't entirely sure this was happening. "No, I'm definitely good..."</p>

<p>"Good."Shadimon stepped up to him, running his hands down the insides of Tathariel's wings and sliding his pants down. He kissed Tathariel again, long enough for the other man to melt into it and drop his guard, and then Shadimon pivoted and swung him onto the bed. Shrike laughed and caught him, divesting him of his shirt and dipping her head to nibble on his ear.</p>

<p>"Hope you know what you're getting into," she crooned. "We're both awfully demanding."</p>
