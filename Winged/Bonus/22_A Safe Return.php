<h1>A Safe Return</h1>
<p>It was at once comforting and devastating to climb into the carry basket. Comforting, because it showed how his people cared about him. But devastating, because it made his clipped wings ache. He adjusted them as he tied the safety line around his waist, carefully keeping them out of sight. New feathers were growing, but they had broken and bled and had to be pulled out more times than he cared to think about. Hopefully being home would help.</p>

<p>The flight over the mountains and back to Asavardi's canyon was equally strange. He could watch the landscape below more than he could when flying himself, but the angle of the wind felt all wrong and made his wings ache even more.</p>

<p>The carry team set down carefully on the top of the canyon. Shadimon looked around as he climbed out, taking in the flourishing farms and the now-complete buildings that had barely been started when he left. There were surprisingly few people out for the time of day, and he frowned a bit as the team packed up the basket to go back to storage.</p>

<p>But then there was someone coming toward him from the canyon lip. Shadimon barely managed to not run, and felt his chest hitching when Baijani wrapped her arms and wings around him, pressing her face against his neck. "Oh Shadi, oh my son, thank the goddess..." She wiped her eyes on her shoulder and briskly drew him back toward the edge, "Let's go home."</p>

<p>As they walked, she kept her wing spread over his back, hiding his mangled ones from sight. But still, there were very few people out. The ones they passed simply raised a hand or called a quiet greeting. Shadimon could feel the pressure building in his chest, and was grateful for the reprieve. If everyone in the village had swarmed to welcome him home...</p>

<p><i>Ah Jani, you plan for everything, don't you...</i></p>

<p>Her home was likewise empty, all of the assorted family members out on their own business. He made a false start toward the sitting area, but she drew him on toward the bedroom. The room was dim and quiet as soon as they were settled, her wings still over him. She brushed his hair - longer than he liked and tangled - back from his face, and that small gesture was enough. Something inside him cracked with no more warning, and he found himself sobbing against her chest.</p>

<p><i>Anger, pain, loneliness, and so, so much grief.</i></p>

<p>Shadimon had had ample time, sitting alone in a stifling windowless cage, to think. More time than he wanted, when he was honest with himself. He'd had plenty of time to tie himself in knots over his actions since the War, always leading back to who he was and what he was trying to become for his people.  It was better than the crippling grief of seeing his damaged wings.</p>

<p>Matias had clearly known that clipping Shadimon's feathers was not good, but Shadimon had hidden the full depth of his reaction for the sake of his own safety. Feathers grew back, but if Coyote had known how devastating that was, he would likely have had Shadimon pinioned.</p>

<p>Somewhere very far away, Baijani was making comforting sounds and stroking his hair.</p>

<p><i>It's over. It's really over.</i></p>

<p>He realized that, until this moment, he had been waiting for it all to come crashing down. It was a long trek back to Riverhaven across open plain that the Coyote riders patrolled. The entire time, Shadimon had been tense, waiting to see the tell-tale dust cloud on the horizon as they came for him. For him, for all those who had risked their lives to save him. All of them could have been dragged back to those dark, stifling cells and never felt the wind or the sun again...</p>

<p>Even on the flight back, the dread was still there. Asavardi had been attacked once. What if it happened again? If there was no home to return to?</p>  

<p>But there was. The village was there, as strong and more beautiful than it had been before. And there was home, in the form of people he loved. Some time, he had no idea when, other people had arrived. He was surrounded and sheltered by comforting hands, and many quiet voices murmuring in the dark.</p>

<p>Finally, the storm passed, and he could breathe a little easier. He was still pressed against Baijani's chest, but there was also someone against his back, someone else over his legs, and a third person tucked above them on the bed. Shadimon felt hollow, like he had been cored out and what was left was barely enough to keep him upright.</p>

<p>He must have slept, because when he next opened his eyes, he and Baijani were alone again, and the house smelled like cooking. She lifted her wing when he moved, letting in cooler air and more light. Someone had put a blanket over him, and tucked pillows against his back for support. He sighed out, feeling more than hearing Baijani's heartbeat, steady as a metronome and drawing him back out of himself.</p>

<p>She brushed his hair back again, "You're home, love."</p>

<p>Shadimon contemplated for a moment, swallowing around an aching throat and rubbing his burning eyes on a blanket. "I feel terrible."</p>

<p>Baijani snorted and flicked his side, "You're making jokes, which is good." She lowered her voice, "And you let it all out. You must have been holding that in for months."</p>

<p>He tensed, voice barely a whisper, "Months? How long...?"</p>

<p>"Four months," she said quietly. "Just shy of four months."</p>

<p>He let out a very long breath. "No wonder I feel like hell."</p>

<p>"You look like hell, too. And kind of smell like it."</p>

<p>Shadimon's shoulders shook in an unwilling chuckle. "Getting dunked in the lake was the first thing resembling a bath I've had in...four months, apparently." He shivered a little, "I am <i>deeply</i> grateful to be free, but narrow drainpipes and a deep lake would not have been my first choice."</p>

<p>Baijani sat up, ignoring his slight grumble, "The girls are working on food; let's get you cleaned up. I'll do your wings for you." She rested her hand on his shoulder when he tensed, "Let me look, please. To see how they're healing."</p>

<p>&"Lots of broken blood-feathers," he muttered, sitting up. "The quills are weak."</p>

<p>She studied him in the light coming from the outer room and ran a finger down the center of his chest. Winged elves have a keel bone to support their flight muscles, and it isn't visible on a healthy individual. Shadimon's was clear, showing just how much muscle he had lost. "Not enough food, I assume. Or the right things?"</p>

<p>He shrugged, "Not starvation rations. At least not for anyone else. And it was all plants. The only meat was very rare jerky."</p>

<p>Baijani grimaced, "Hopefully proper food will make the difference. I'll check you over; hopefully we don't have to pull any feathers."</p>

<p>Shadimon's lips quirked into a twisted smile, "Walking the novice healer through pulling a broken blood feather was an experience I'd rather not repeat. Funny, looking back on it. Poor boy was terrified he was going to make it worse. But he was really touchy about anything to do with my wings after..." He paused, glancing at Baijani, "He's a follower of Errigal, so he did the best he could. But talking someone through cutting my feathers..."</p>

<p>Baijani stroked his shoulder, "Easy, love. Don't go back there. Come on, up. You'll feel much better after you're clean."</p>

<p>Shrike detached from the group in the kitchen when they emerged, and followed them to the bathing room. The small basin usually used for laundry was already full of water, and the two women finished getting out bath things while Shadimon stripped out of his grimy pants. Those immediately got thrown into the wash basin as well, though he wasn't entirely sure they were salvageable.</p>

<p>The soap they had wasn't the nicest, but he set to it with a will, ferociously scrubbing away months of dust and grime. While he did that, Baijani and Shrike started working on his wings, teasing apart matted feathers and getting them clean. It was uncomfortable, but as he started on a third round of scrubbing, he could almost feel the weight of dirt coming out of his feathers. A glance down showed there were also a significant amount of feathers coming off as well...</p>

<p>"Go easy, or you're going to have the skin off," Baijani said from behind him. "And you're right; the blood feathers aren't as sturdy as they ought to be. None of them look in danger of cracking as long as you're careful, and hopefully better food will help shore that up." She patted his back, "Would you like me to trim your hair while we're here?"</p>

<p>"Please, back up to the shoulders."</p>

<p>Shrike kept working on his wings, while Baijani took a comb and scissors to his hair. Eventually he closed his eyes and just...relaxed into it, letting them take care of him. By the time Shrike took a soft oiled cloth to his feathers, he actually felt that knot of tension in his chest releasing. Not entirely, but a good start. Baijani had been right; just being clean helped his mood considerably.</p>

<p>Her family made room for him as they always did. He was deeply grateful that they didn&rsquo;t bombard him with welcomes or questions, but instead just treated it like any other meal.</p>
