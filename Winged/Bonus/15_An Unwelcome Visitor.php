<h1>An Unwelcome Visitor</h1>

<p>"They're coming!"</p>
<p>The winged elf watcher swooped into the entrance to town hall, shouting his warning before his feet even touched the ground.</p>
<p>Baijani had finished whispering her message to the feather. She passed it to one of the Harriers assembled to guard the hall.</p>
<p>"Hide it," she told him.</p>
<p>The soldier nodded as he took the precious artifact and ducked into a back room. Baijani looked at the elves around her. Five Harriers had come to protect her, plush Shrike and the watcher.</p>
<p>"Baijani…" the watcher panted, "They're taking hostages."</p>
<p>"What!?" She spun around.</p>
<p>The watcher gulped, "They were grabbing anyone who hadn't flown away. They're tying up their arms and wings and they're… dangling them off the cliffs."</p>
<p>Shrike hissed through her teeth, "<i>Assholes.</i>"</p>
<p>"What do we do?" The watcher asked.</p>
<p>"Well," Baijani took a deep breath, "We've pulled up the ladders so they can't get up here. We'll have to-"</p>
<p>Baijani was interrupted by a clang. She glanced back at the entrance. Grappling hooks.</p>
<p>One of the Harriers darted towards them to try to knock them off. He darted back as no fewer than six arrows zipped past him.</p>
<p>Shrike pressed Baijani back, "Don't let them-"</p>
<p>"Hey up there!" An angry female voice echoed from outside, "I got a guy down here named Radiven. He says he doesn't want to try to fly with his wings pinned down. If you don't wanna find out if he can, you let us climb up there, si?"</p>
<p>Shrike gave Baijani a worried look.</p>
<p>"Mom…"</p>
<p>Baijani shook her head, "We have no choice."</p>
<p>"Come up, but if you attack we will fight back!" Baijani called out.</p>
<p>"Form up, stay in a group," Shrike whispered to the Harriers, "Stay back from the entrance and don't fight unless we have to, but don't hesitate if we have to."</p>
<p>The Harriers wordlessly took up defensive positions around Baijani. The watcher scrambled away, back into the offices to hide. Baijani took a breath and composed herself for whatever was going to come up those ropes.</p>
<p>There was a shuffle from outside. The ropes attached to the grappling hooks began to sway. Two Coyotes entered the town hall. They wore red cloth bandanas under wide brimmed hats, as well as tan colored ponchos with embroidery that would have been pretty if not for who was wearing it. They were armored in light chain under the ponchos, and bore glaives that Baijani oddly recognized as Silversheen.</p>
<p>The Coyotes kicked the ladder back down and turned to face the winged elves. They braced their polearms in a defensive stance, but did not advance. They had the composure of professionals, not thugs. It wasn't quite what she had been expecting.</p>
<p>Four more Coyotes came up the ladder, including a woman with dark brown hair, teal eyes, and a face that would have been attractive if not for the smug, angry expression on it. The other Coyotes took up ranks around her. The woman took a step towards Baijani, but stopped a healthy distance away. She scanned the assembled winged elves, then tipped her hat at Baijani.</p>
<p>"Hola, pollos," she spoke in a strange dialect Baijani couldn't quite place, "I'm Breaker, and I'm gonna make this real simple. You're in my town now. You and yours are gonna sit still and cool your heels while we go through your stuff and take what we want. We do that, and no one else is gonna die. I got more pollos hanging out, fixin' to see if they can fly without wings. You start getting smart or brave, we start plucking feathers. That clear?" </p>
<p>Baijani steps forward from the rest of the group, head held high and wings partially spread. She makes no effort to hide the anger in her eyes. “I’m Baijani. In the Mother’s name, I greet you. Tell me, <span class="tooltip">syala<span class="tooltiptext">jackal</span></span>, what in Her name are you doing.”</p>
<p>There is something of a chuckle from the Coyotes. Breaker gives Baijani a curious look before continuing.</p>
<p>"Uh, thought I made that pretty clear, pollo," She speaks in a slow, mocking tone, "We. Are. Taking. Your. Stuff. Theft, robbery, banditry, comprende, si?" </p>
<p>Baijani smirks coldly, “Yes, you’ll have to forgive an old woman. I’d thought the war had rid us of animals. Such a shame to find them still here, wearing familiar faces.” Her eyes harden, “Very well, bandit woman. Have the decency to stay out of peoples’ homes, but take what you wish from storage upstairs.” She looks past Breaker, scanning the soldiers with her, “If you had need, we would have helped you had you asked. If your people are starving, we would have sent food. You shouldn’t be cold, since you stole the cloth that was meant for us.” She meets Breaker’s eyes again, angry and unafraid, “Go, then. Rob your siblings, and get out of my village. May the Mother not see you.”</p>
<p>Breaker leans casually on her polearm, giving Baijani a bemused look while she speaks. When she finishes, Breaker laughs.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Abuela," she shakes her head, "It's a little too late for a guilt trip to work on me. You know there's always gonna be people like me out there. Still, I like that you got the huevos to chew out a bandit storming her house right to her fucking face. I like that."</p>
<p>She looks over the rest of the winged elves, "Sounds like you understand me though. We're gonna do this the easy way then. I'll leave anyone else untouched so long as you and yours stay where they are. Stay put, no one gets hurt. Someone tries to be a hero, things get ugly. We take what we want and leave either way, si?" </p>
<p>“We’re tired of killing, and you appear to have us here. Shrike? Let her pass.”</p>
<p>Eyeing the Coyotes, Shrike edged around Baijani and toward the entrance. Her sharp whistle echoed off the canyon walls in a lilting pattern. “And now people know to wait,” Baijani said, when the echoes faded. </p>
<p>"Good," Breaker nods, "<span class="tooltip">Su moneda o su muerte<span class="tooltiptext">Your money or your life</span></span>, we're gonna get what we want, and there's no money in a corpse. Just stay put Abuela and you'll get your little ones back."</p>
<p>She glances around the room, "I'm gonna leave this room before the tall one there decides to be a hero. You stay safe up here, si?"</p>
<p>With that, Breaker and her guards slowly head back, leaving Baijani and her elves unharmed. </p>
<p>Shrike glances back at Baijani, “Mama?”</p>
<p>“Once they leave,” Baijani says quietly. She shifts her wings so the Harriers behind her can move forward. “Once the hostages are down, go.”</p></p>
<p>-FIN-</p>
