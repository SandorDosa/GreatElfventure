    <h1>A Moonlit Flight</h1>
    <p>As people began trickling out of the potluck, Anasatri went back to the map on the table, tracing the course of the river and matching it up to the map in her head. “Here,” she murmured, tapping one of the river curves, “It was here.”</p>
    <p>“That’s where you’re going?” Baijani said, ducking around one of Anasatri’s wings. She peered at the map, “Long way. Have a time frame?”</p>
    <p>Anasatri looked up, squinting through the haze at the moon, three-quarters full. “By the full moon. That’s...six days, starting tomorrow.” </p>
    <p>Baijani glanced around and flagged down Dhakamari. She pointed on the map, “Mari, from Surt to here. Can it be done in six days?”</p>
    <p>He leaned over the map, muttering over areas around Asavardi and measuring distances. “Yes, as long as there’s no headwind, but it’s going to be hard.” He glanced at Anasatri, ears going down, “Scouts would have a hard time making it.”</p>
    <p>She nodded, that faint manic look back in her eyes, “I’ll be able to. I have to.”</p>
    <p>Dhakamari chewed on his lip, “Going to need a lot of food to make up for that. Too much to carry alone.”</p>
    <p>Baijani clapped him on the shoulder, “And that’s part of why you’re going with her.”</p>
    <p>His ears and wings dropped, “But...Asavardi…!”</p>
    <p>“Will do fine without its star hero for a little while, I’m sure. It’ll encourage the others to fly higher in your absence.” She glanced at Anasatri, who was looking back up at the sky, “She’s going to need you more. You’re steady, and can see to it she eats and rests. This is god-driven; she can’t not do this.”</p>
    <p>Dhakamari squared his shoulders, “All right. We’ll need supplies, more than we brought with us…”</p>
    <p>Baijani nodded, “I’ll talk to Hunger.”</p>
    <p>“But…” He glanced back at the map, “Just to get us there. See, the Fort is only another couple days on.” He looked around, spotting the blade elves still near the entrance. “If we can resupply and rest there before heading home, that’ll make this much easier.” He hurried over to the blade elves, waiting patiently, “Grandmaster?”</p>
    <p>Ehra looked up from a quiet conversation with Captain Villhook and gave Dhakamari a smile, "Yes?" </p>
    <p>“Loremaster Anasatri and I have an errand to run near the Fort. Would it be possible for us to stop there to rest and resupply before starting back to Asavardi?”</p>
    <p>The Grandmaster gave a genuine laugh and put a hand on the young scout's shoulder, "Without the slightest doubt, Dhakamari. You are always welcome at Alfyr. Our home is your home. No questions asked or conditions given. I trust you, as well as Anasatri." </p>
    <p>Dhakamari blushed, flicking his ears down to try to hide it, “Thank you sir. It’ll be um, a week or two probably?"</p>
    <p>"We'll make sure to have extra supplies and a room," Ehra patted his shoulder, "Fly safe. I'll see you then."</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.myinstants.com/instant/windows-xp-error/">(Dhakamari’s internal monologue)</a></p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Six days at top speed was a very long time. Dhakamari spent most of it flying in the lead, letting Anasatri ride in his wake where the going was a little easier. She was intensely focused on her task, and was honestly distressed that she couldn’t tell him the details. She knew perfectly well that he was along to keep an eye on her, and she was good-natured about it. She let him bully her into eating and resting, and he in turn let them fly longer than was ideal.</p>
    <p>Their path went sharply southeast, cutting across the dry terrain of the Maar and through the forests of the center of elven territory. The Maar had helped them quite a bit, providing thermals and strong winds, but they didn’t quite make it in time.</p>
    <p>As the sun started setting, Dhakamari fell back a bit so he and Anasatri could talk. “We need to stop,” he signed. “Getting dark.”</p>
    <p>“We’re so close!” she replied.</p>
    <p>“You’re exhausted; if we keep going, you’ll drop.”</p>
    <p>She peered ahead, searching for the bend in the river, but it was out of sight.</p>
    <p>“We can rest for the night and check it out in the morning,” Dhakamari said gently.</p>
    <p>Anasatri’s wings were trembling with the effort to keep going, and she slowly nodded, “All right, you’re right.”</p>
    <p>Dhakamari turned his attention to the ground, scanning for a campsite before the light failed.</p>
    <p>Suddenly he was rocked by turbulence as Anasatri lunged ahead, “Look! Look there it is! There’s a light there!” She took off, leaving Dhakamari scrambling to catch up to her.</p>
    <p>“Satri! <i>Satri!</i>” She ignored him, plowing on toward that faint light.</p>
    <p>Anasatri drove herself towards that distant point of light. She heard Dhakamari yelling something, but couldn't quite make it out. Her wings ached, but she paid it no mind. She was almost there!</p>
    <p>As she pressed on, Dhakamari fell in quietly beside her. The light on the horizon grew and began to flicker. As they grew closer, she realized it was a fire. A large one, but contained.</p>
    <p>As they drew closer to the fire, Anasatri could see something moving. Shapes, moving around the fire. It was hard to tell scale in the dark, but it might be people. She heard a faint sound she couldn't make out.</p>
    <p>The fire grew in her vision. It was a large bonfire. She could make out the shapes more clearly. Definitely people, maybe a couple hundred, moving around the fire. As she swooped low, she could make out the sound.</p>
    <p>It was music. Cheerful sounds of fiddles, singing, and accordions. She recognized the shapes. It was river elves, singing and dancing around the fire.</p>
    <p>Anasatri’s landing was anything but graceful. She stumbled to her knees and sat there for a moment, catching her breath. Dhakamari landed beside her with a bit more decorum, crouching down to check on her.</p>
    <p>“I’m...fine,” she panted. “Not...what I...expected...to find.” </p>
    <p>“A party? No, me neither. Not a bad thing though,” Dhakamari said.</p>
    <p>Anasatri looked around, taking in the bonfire and the rising full moon. “Oh...they fought Afflicted. And it’s the first full moon.” She tilted her head, taking in the festivities.</p>
    <p>"Mais la!" A river elf voice calls out from the group nearby, "'Ey! I think that was a couple flap flaps!"</p>
    <p>A handful of figures detaches from the group and cross the short distance. Once they get closer, Anasatri and Dhakamari recognize them as Crocodilians. Several of the river elf soldiers have bandaged injuries. The group quickly surrounds the winged elves, and a couple kneel around Anasatri and Dhakamari.</p>
    <p>"Whoo!" One of them puts a hand on Dhakamari's shoulder, "That looked rough! You alright, cher?" </p>
    <p>“We’re all right, just tired,” Dhakamari replies. “And we’re not here because of trouble,” he hurries on, anticipating the obvious worry. “We’ve just come a long way in a short time.” He smiles tiredly, “If we can sit and catch our breath for a bit, that’d be very much appreciated.”</p>
    <p>"<span class="tooltip">Regarde, c'est la petite héros!<span class="tooltiptext">Look! It's the little hero!</span></span>" One of the river elves calls out, "Mari! How you been!"</p>
    <p>“I don’t-! I’m not-!”</p>
    <p>Almost before he could speak, more river elves rushed over to help the two stand. Despite his protests, Dhakamari was practically swarmed by happy river elves. He was actually physically picked up, put on a pair of people's shoulders, and carried off towards the dancing with happy shouting and whistles.</p>
    <p>Someone had helped Anasatri stand. She steadies herself on her helpers arm and turns to make out his face in the flickering light.</p>
    <p>"Hey Loremaster," Terje speaks with a completely bewildered expression on his face, "You're gonna want to eat something."</p>
    <p>Terje passes a spring roll to her. </p>
    <p>Anasatri takes it gratefully, “You’re a life-saver, thank you.” She looks around, giggling at Dhakamari’s mild panic. “We heard about the fight from Staurois, and got Smilisca’s message that you won. This is the aftermath, I suppose?” </p>
    <p>"Yeah…" Terje still has a baffled expression on his face, like he's not completely sure he's awake, "I, uh, heard it was happening when Smilisca called Ehra to see if we could help. We couldn't send soldiers, but I couldn't just… do nothing. I got some medics and supplies together to come down, we weren't going to be able to get here in time to help in the fight but the aftermath…"</p>
    <p>Terje pauses, then starts again, "I just wanted to make sure my boyfriend was okay, and now I have no idea what's happening."</p>
    <p>He looks at Anasatri, "I'm awake, right? You'd tell me if I was dreaming."</p>
    <p>“If you are, then I am too, which wouldn’t surprise me that much really. But I’m pretty sure Dhakamari is in fact being absolutely mobbed, and if I was dreaming, he’d be more enthusiastic and less panicked.” She looks around at the river elves, “I know this is what they do after fighting Lycans. But it’s not normally so...cheerful?” She glances at Terje, “Is that what’s getting to you too?”</p>
    <p>Terje opens and closes his mouth a few times, "I genuinely can't tell you because I actually can't say the words. I… I better just show you. Eat a little. Seriously."</p>
    <p>Anasatri helps herself to the entire plate he was carrying, cleaning it in moments. “Much less likely to fall on my face now! Probably. So what is so worrying? Surely if anyone was going to show the Affliction, they would have by now, right? So everyone is alright?”</p>
    <p>"Yeah," Terje loops his arm through hers and starts walking her towards the celebration, "They fought <i>three hundred</i> afflicted lycanthropes, and not a single person turned. Uh, you can dance, right?" </p>
    <p>“Sure! Can you?”</p>
    <p>Terje laughs, sounding a bit relieved, "Technically yes! C'mon."</p>
    <p>Thankfully the river elves seem to care more about how enthusiastic your dancing is than your actual skill. Terje leads, slowly making his way towards the center of the group and the bonfire itself. Anasatri has a little trouble getting around with her wings, but any bump is met with laughter and babbling in Sylvan. As they near the center, they hit a clump of people cheering and clapping. Anasatri can't quite see over the taller river elves.</p>
    <p>"C'mon, you gotta see this," Terje kneels down and pats his shoulders. </p>
    <p>“If you’re sure…” Anasatri laughs and clambers onto his shoulders, keeping her wings tucked close to avoid upsetting his balance. </p>
    <p>Terje stumbles slightly as her weight is much less than he was expecting. He regains his footing easily though, and turns her towards the bonfire.</p>
    <p>It took Anasatri's eyes a few moments to adjust to the bright light. She could see a few figures dancing close to the fire.</p>
    <p>As her vision improved, she could make out two figures in specific. It was Smilisca and Litoria. The two cousins were dancing happily in celebration. Surprisingly happily. Litoria had an honest to the goddess bright smile on her face. Anasatri had never seen that before.</p>
    <p>As she watched, she saw another figure in the group. Smilisca waved and said something, then Litoria turned to dance with this other elf. As Anasatri focused, she recognized her.</p>
    <p>It was the Tourist, in her elven form but fully equipped with her armor and sword. She was dancing with the river elves, as if she had always belonged there. With Litoria and Smilisca. Smiling.</p>
    <p>Slowly, she realized that the group of river elves weren't just clapping and cheering for the bonfire. They were cheering for <i>her.</i></p>
    <p>Anasatri patted Terje’s head, “That’s what I was hoping for! I’ve got to talk to her! Do you think they’ll be mad? Should I wait?”</p>
    <p>Terje looks up at her with wide eyes, "<i>Hoping for?</i>" </p>
    <p>“Yes! I’d thought I might find her here, and...Ah, sorry, this isn’t helping is it. If I say it’s an oracle thing, is that good enough for now? No...that probably makes it even worse. Um...Great party? It’s wonderful to see Litoria smiling?”</p>
    <p>Terje chuckles. Then laughs. Then proceeds to burst into a fit of alternating barking laughs and barely controlled giggles. Anasatri begins to sway as his knees buckle a bit.</p>
    <p>Things slow down. It becomes quiet. Anasatri looks up at Luna. She sees a beam of moonlight coming down. Oddly, it doesn't point at the Tourist. It points away from the bonfire, towards the river. What…</p>
    <p>Anasatri tumbles to the ground as Terje collapses in a giggle fit. She isn't hurt, but it's a bit embarrassing. Terje rotates up to sitting and wipes tears from his eyes as the laughing slows.</p>
    <p>"Sorry Satri!" Another giggle escapes, "I just couldn't!" </p>
    <p>Anasatri scrambles up, trying to see where the moonbeam is pointing. There’s still a jostling crowd of laughing river elves, and she can’t see past them. <i>Baijani would murder me if I take off alone.</i> “Terje, can you come with me for a minute?”</p>
    <p>"Uh, sure," he coughs and stands up, "are you okay?"</p>
    <p>“I’m fine, can you see…” she glances at him, but he mostly looks bemused. She  grabs his shirt collar and pulls him down so she can whisper under the crowd noise, “Something is happening or going to happen on the river. I don’t know what, or if it’s dangerous, but I need to see, and I need someone to keep an eye on me or warn the others if there’s danger.”</p>
    <p>Terje blinks at Anasatri slowly.</p>
    <p>"Sure!" His voice only cracks a little bit.</p>
    <p>The moonbeam leads down towards the river. It is some distance from the bonfire. The light fades and the din of the party tones down to a dull rumble in the background. It is dark, but somehow Anasatri can see well in the moonlight. Terje follows her, completely bewildered.</p>
    <p>The beam of moonlight leads to a line of reeds along the river bank. </p>
    <p>Anasatri glances up at the moon and back at the water. “I’m going to trust I’m not here to get eaten by fish or a crocodile or whatever else lives in the river.” She steps into the patch of reeds, stooping to see if she can find anything buried among them. </p>
    <p>Digging in the reeds on the side of the river, Anasatri’s hand encounters rough scales.  It’s hard to see in the dark, but she follows the line of the scales and they continue on for several feet before ending in what is unmistakably the head of a very large alligator.  The gator turns its head and blinks one bright, golden eye at the winged elf with a hand on the very tip of its very fat tail.</p>
    <p>Anasatri slowly lifts her hand and takes a few steps backward, “Uh, excuse me.”</p>
    <p>The fat one-eyed alligator hisses a warning in her general direction.  It is an obese, menacing sight, many pounds of reptile that could attack at any moment.</p>
    <p><i>FWAP</i></p>
    <p>A webbed hand makes a very silly slapping noise across the gator’s snout.</p>
    <p>“Blinkin you leave that flap flap alone, you.”  A river elf with a bandaged shoulder and his arm in a sling emerges from the dark water behind the gator.  The alligator blinks his one golden eye and pulls himself lazily away, scooting inches at a time and making it look like a whole lot of effort.</p>
    <p>“Sorry ‘bout him.  Only so much trainin’ you ken teach a gator and have it stick, weh?”</p>
    <p>As Anasatri looks at this river elf soldier standing waist deep in the water, she sees him dimly illuminated. She looks up and realizes that without a doubt, the beam of moonlight leads to him. </p>
    <p>“Ah, no harm, my mistake for disturbing him. Ah, and you. I’m Anasatri.” She squints through the dim light, “Would you like some help? I have some healing magic.” </p>
    <p>"I appreciate th' offerin', bu' it's probably better to save it for thems that need it fer real.  I'll heal.  Mais!  It's mostly a bruise now!"  The elf sits down on the alligator's back. </p>
    <p>“That’s good! You’re missing quite a party out here, though?” </p>
    <p>"Weh," he agrees, nodding emphatically in the dark.  "But there'll be other parties.  I owe too much to Her to want ta miss this chance to say it while She's all bright an payin' attention like."  He points up at the moon.</p>
    <p>Anasatri smiles a little and turns to look at Terje, “Thanks for coming with me Terje, but I think I’m good now. I expect to see you drunkenly dancing with Smilisca later, yes?”</p>
    <p>Terje gives a somewhat <a href="https://gfycat.com/blaringhideousherald">unstable bleary eyed salute</a> and declares, "Best idea I've heard all night, ma'am." Before turning around and marching back towards the party.</p>
    <p>Anasatri goes closer to the river elf, keeping a wary eye on Blinkin. “She’s actually why I’m here. Can we talk for a bit?” </p>
    <p>"Foh shore, ami, but ya don't mind my asking - who are you?"  He pats the flank of the gator as an invitation for her to sit down.</p>
    <p>She eyes the alligator again before sitting warily next to the river elf. “Anasatri, I’m the winged elf Loremaster. You?” </p>
    <p>"Allophryne. I'm uh, a river elf Crocodilian."</p>
    <p>“Allophryne. You’re a follower of Luna. When I came here, I didn’t expect an elf to be who I was looking for. That’s unusual, isn’t it?"</p>
    <p>Allophryne shrugs.  "I wouldn't say I'm a follower of Luna.  It's more like - well.  I though' I done finally got meself kill't, an in th' worst way.   But - mais la - here I am, me.  Ain't even feelin a little bit bitey."  He looks up to the moon again.  "An Calestros don't mind me sayin thanks to Her that done made that possible."</p>
    <p>“Ahh, I understand.” Anasatri shifts her wings, getting a faint grumble from the alligator. “Well, that at least makes this less weird. I’m an oracle, and I asked Luna for help with something. She sent me a vision, which brought me here to the party. Then she put a nice spotlight right on top of you to make sure I found you.” She shrugs a little, “Something is...wrong. I don’t know what, really, but She needs help.”</p>
    <p>“Don’ know nuthin’ ‘bout that.”  He looks down to the reflection of the moon in the water.  “I been axin if she’d let me learn to do what she does, but one done pretty much said no, an the Other don’t exactly talk much.”</p>
    <p>Anasatri tugs a little on her magic, channeling it to show any aura he might have. There is a faint glow, but not what she associates with divine magic. “Getting a solid answer is hard at the best of times.” She also looks up at the moon, shivering a little at the memory of the terrible cracks spreading across Her surface. “In the vision she sent me, I saw a white wolf with her. Something...happened - I’m sorry, it feels like telling a secret to say more - and the wolf...fell. And landed here. I’d thought it might be the one you all call the Stranger, but She brought me here to you.” She shrugs helplessly, “I don’t know what it means yet. But she protected you and put both of us here…” She trails off, looking back up at the sky.</p>
    <p>“A white wolf you say?”  Allophryne raises an eyebrow questioningly.  “She were a white werewolf on the battlefield before she done come an used Her magic to do the healin.”  He runs a thumb along the gator’s rough scales.  “I ain’t nobody special.  Just a regular soldier who got handed a third chance.”</p>
    <p>Allophryne rolls up the leg of his shorts.  “Look here’s my second chance.”  There’s a very clear very old scar that looks like a bite mark from what had to have been some monster of a crocodile.  “Got bit by one of ‘em couyon crocodiles that done murdered our Skati.  Didn’t Turn then.  An this,” he points to the bandage on his shoulder, “this did give me the Affliction.  An that wolf - she cured me.”</p>
    <p>“That wolf...Stranger?” </p>
    <p>“More like Friend now.”</p>
    <p>“Right, of course. I want to talk to her too while I’m here.” She leans back on her hands, suddenly remembering that she’s sitting on a huge alligator when she feels the scales. At this point, the alligator was the least strange part of the night. “I’m glad to have met you. And I’m very glad that this potentially very bizarre series of revelations wasn’t...too weird.” She looks back toward the faint light from the bonfire, “You won’t go back tonight? Seeing Litoria dancing with the Lycan was quite a thing.” </p>
    <p>“Apparently She done brought you to talk to me.”  Allophryne grins.  “If’n you wanna go back an get some dancin’ in, I’d foh shore join ya.”</p>
    <p>“Absolutely! Goddess-” She pauses and laughs, “Goddesses! Life got a little more existentially complicated, ah?” She holds out a hand to help him up if he needs it.</p>
    <p>Allophryne accepts her help with his good arm, but as he’s significantly taller than the winged elf, that doesn’t seem as necessary as much as it is polite.  Blinkin slinks off into the river to lurk.</p>
    <p>Anasatri and Allophryne return to the party to find that very little has changed. This celebration hasn’t slowed for a moment, it is a truly miraculous occasion. True to his word, Anasatri can see Terje has made his way to Smilisca and the two are celebrating their reunion with some truly hilariously horrendous dancing. From somewhere in the crowd, Anasatri can see a pair of wings poking from over a clump of river elves’ heads and just almost hear faint rambling apologies.</p>
    <p>After a few moments of scanning, Anasatri spots her target. The Tourist and Litoria are still dancing, only moderately less awkwardly than Terje and Smilisca. Still, the joy in that group is patently obvious, even from here. There’s a bit of a challenge, though - the crowd is thickest near them. </p>
    <p>Anasatri looks at the wall of dancing river elves, shrugs, and taps the nearest person to ask to dance. Everyone is more than happy for her to join in, and she laughs as she spins her way through the crowd.</p>
    <p>The river elves are thrilled to have another participant. In a way, navigating the crowd is a bit like swimming through a river. No one’s trying to block her, but she can’t exactly see where she’s going and there sure is a current.</p>
    <p>She decides to go with the flow. She’s not sure how long she spends dancing, but it’s an emotional release for her. It feels like a reward. Time passes, and she feels her exhaustion grow. Just as she’s thinking about tracking down Allophryne and asking where she could rest, she hits the edge of the crowd.</p>
    <p>The bonfire has started to get low, almost down to embers. Plenty of people have decided to sit down and begin to rest. Two, however, are still dancing. Though they have slowed somewhat, in the poor light, Anasatri can’t quite tell who the two figures are. She looks through the group, trying to figure out where her target is.</p>
    <p>She squints at the two dancing figures. Just as Anasatri’s vision starts to clear, she sees the two figures lean in towards each other. As she realizes that it’s Litoria and the Tourist, she witnesses the two share a kiss.</p>
    <p>The surrounding river elves break out into whoops and laughter. </p>
    <p>Anasatri grins and laughs, clapping along with all the others. She doesn’t know the werewolf, but she knows Litoria well enough to be very happy for her. She works her way around to approach them so they can both see her coming and holds up a hand, “Litoria! I-”</p>
    <p id="i">*Thud*</p>
    <p>It’s hard to judge time through a tent wall, but based on the light, it might be midmorning? Anasatri opens her eyes only to find her view blocked by grey feathers. Dhakamari mutters as she pushes his wing out of the way from where it had sprawled over her. He squints up at her through hair that had escaped his braid, “S’morning? G’morning.”</p>
    <p>“You too. We seem to have a tent. Not our tent.”</p>
    <p>Dhakamari rolls upright, pulling his hair over his shoulder to start redoing the braid, “I don’t remember a tent. I think I might have spent a lot of the evening drinking. I’m not sure about that either?”</p>
    <p>“You were dancing. We passed in the crowd a few times.” She bumps her shoulder against his, “Good to see you loosening up.”</p>
    <p>He gives her a lopsided grin, “You too. Did you find what you needed?” He suddenly blinks, “Oh, I left you alone. I didn’t <i>mean</i> to-”</p>
    <p>She bumps him on the head with her wing, “I don’t think they gave you a choice, sparrow. But yes, I think so. But today I need to talk to the werewolf...and ask her her name, I can’t keep calling her ‘the werewolf’ or ‘the tourist’ or something. <i>Especially,</i> did you see? She and Litoria kissed!”</p>
    <p>Dhakamari blinks a few times, contemplating this. “I didn’t see. Huh. That’s something, isn’t it.”</p>
    <p>“It is! Something good. Very good. I’m going to ask her about the observatory. And...Luna in general. There’s a lot going on that I don’t understand.” She tilts her head toward the tent entrance, “I hear plenty of activity out there, feel free to keep mingling or whatever seems fun.”</p>
    <p>“<i>Breakfast</i> seems fun. Judging by the light we’ve already missed the first one.”</p>
    <p>Anasatri giggles, “I don’t think river elves do as many meals as we do, but the food last night was amazing, and I’m sure we can find some more. Let’s go see.” She pulls open the tent flap, letting Dhakamari out behind her.</p>
    <p>They find that the camp is already well underway. Though the river elves are moving maybe a bit slower than usual, this is still a military camp and there are jobs to get done. The camp is pleasantly humming with activity.</p>
    <p>“Mornin’,” Terje sighs nearby.</p>
    <p>Anasatri looks over to see the blade elf sitting cross legged with a basket of more of those spring rolls in his lap. He looks a bit more stable than last night, but only a little bit. He picks up the basket and offers it to the two winged elves.</p>
    <p>“You two alright?” </p>
    <p>“Morning Terje!” Anasatri takes some of the spring rolls and passes one to Dhakamari, “We’re fine, slept quite well. Do you know who the tent belongs to? Neither of us remembers getting to it…”</p>
    <p>“Uh…” Terje shuffles uncomfortably, “It’s previous owner doesn’t need it anymore. It wasn’t an easy battle, even with the wolf on their side.” </p>
    <p>Anasatri winces, “Oh, oh I’m sorry, that was a bad question.”</p>
    <p>Terje raises a hand and shakes his head, “Don’t worry about it. I know you’re not a soldier. It’s… just a pragmatism thing.”</p>
    <p>He pauses and gives her a look, “She’s at the field hospital. You can go talk to her, when you’re ready. She’ll be there for a little while.” </p>
    <p>“Oh, thank you. That’s a good place for me to be anyway. Mari, I’ll be there if you need me.” She snags another spring roll fromTerje and heads off. Once she’s out of sight she suddenly realizes she didn’t ask where the hospital was, but several people are more than happy to point her in the right direction.</p>
    <p>The field hospital is a large open area with rows of wounded being treated. Only a few areas have rain flies to protect the most badly injured. Among the recovering wounded, Anasatri can see a mix of river elf and blade elf medics going about their business. Among them stands the Tourist, walking between some of the most badly wounded and delivering the odd bit of magic healing. The river elf medics seem comfortable with her presence, but the other blade elves are still giving her odd looks.</p>
    <p>As Anasatri approaches, one of the blade elf medics recognizes her. He walks up and asks if she’d like to offer her help. Most of the wounded are out of serious danger, but there are still plenty of grievous injuries that need help. </p>
    <p>Anasatri tucks her wings tight against her back to keep them well out of the way and dives in. She specifically heads for the more closed off areas, to see to the worst wounded. This is where she spent most of her time during the War, and the work is familiar. She and the medics quickly settle into an easy system: Anasatri dealt with the broken bones, the infections, the bite wounds too deep or ragged to stitch, and the medics moved in behind with fresh splints and clean bandages. Anasatri also did her turn with the non-magical work, falling back into wartime habits with surprising ease. An hour or two later, she steps aside to wash her hands and sit for a moment to rest.</p>
    <p>While Anasatri is sitting and drinking water, she sees the Lycan straighten up from one of the nearby patients. After seeing that she appeared to be done for the moment, Anasatri refills her cup, grabs another, and walks over to her. “Here, water?”</p>
    <p>The Tourist appears a bit different than the descriptions she has heard so far. Mainly, instead of long untamed hair she has it held in a single long braid. The Lycan looks down at her with a raised eyebrow and takes the cup.</p>
    <p>“Thank you, Anasatri,” she says conversationally. </p>
    <p>“You’re welcome, Du-” Anasatri blinks. “Oh! You <i>are</i> Dusk!” She laughs, “No <i>wonder</i> you knew so much about the star charts! Oh that’s clever, was it your idea or Shadimon’s to disguise yourself as a dreamdust elf?”</p>
    <p>The Lycan laughs slightly, “That was fast. I suppose I need to work on my subterfuge. I do not precisely have the best track record lately. It was Shadimon’s idea. He had to tell me what a dreamdust elf even looks like.”</p>
    <p>She pauses, then speaks in a more serious tone, “I heard he was captured by those bandits down south. Do you know if he is alright?” </p>
    <p>“Your subterfuge is fine, I just recognize your voice. And...he was alive as of a week ago. He’s a high-value hostage, so we think they’re going to keep him alive for now. He was hurt, badly, but they at least bandaged him up.” She stretches her wings, which had gotten cramped from holding them so tightly folded, “Do you have anywhere to be? I’d like to talk to you for a bit if I can. I was hoping to find you last night, but with the party and all…”</p>
    <p>The Tourist nods, “I’m glad he is as well as can be expected, in the circumstances. He’s a good man. And no, my duties are done for the morning. I have some sparring with Litoria this afternoon, but I am free for the time being. Did you actually fly all this way just to talk to me?” </p>
    <p>“<i>Sparring</i>, you say,” Anasatri says with a grin. “Sounds fun! And I <i>thought</i> I was flying all this way to talk to you, but there turned out to be someone else I needed to see too.” She puts her hands on her hips and sighs, “And here I was thinking ‘Ah! Someone I can ask about the observatory and the star charts! Who would certainly know more than the dreamdust elves! How wonderful!’ Little knowing you already <i>have</i> helped us with that. A huge amount, by the way. Your help has made that project even doable.” </p>
    <p>“I…” the Tourist honest to the gods blushes at the first part of Anasatri’s statement. After a second or two she clears her throat and continues, “Someone else? Who did you talk to?” </p>
    <p>“Allophryne. I didn’t know I needed to talk to him, but…” She pauses, glancing up, unsure how this was going to go, “Luna led me to him.”</p>
    <p>“<i>What?</i>” The Tourist turns to her, looking her up and down, “How… No, you aren’t lying. That’s not…”</p>
    <p>She stumbles over her words for a few moments, then looks at her severely, “You, me, Litoria, and Allophryne are going to have a chat. Right now. Come with me.” </p>
    <p>With that, the Lycan turns and starts walking back towards the camp. </p>
    <p>Anasatri has to jog to keep up with the Lycan’s much longer strides, especially with her in a hurry. “Allophryne was as baffled as I am, so I’m <i>very</i> glad you’re here to talk to. You see why I did come all this way.”</p>
    <p>The Tourist glances back at Anasatri with a stern expression, then looks forward again. She slows her pace slightly and doesn't respond for a few moments.</p>
    <p>"I see why you came," she finally says, "Now I want to know why you were sent." </p>
    <p>“So do I,” Anasatri mumbles.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t take long for the Tourist to track down Allophryne and Litoria - and of course, Sauver. Since there’s not really any privacy in a river elf encampment, she leads them some distance away from camp. While it’s no dense forest, a small cluster of scrub trees provides enough of a barrier that they can talk in peace. Once everyone has settled, the Tourist turns to the group.</p>
    <p>“Anasatri,” she begins, “Your presence is far too much to be coincidence, especially with everything else that has happened in the last few days. For some reason, the four-” she glances at the hippo, “-five of us have all been drawn here. We need to put everything on the table and find out why. Anasatri, would you care to begin by telling us how you found us here?”</p>
    <p>“I...well,” She glances at Litoria, “Several seasons back our scouts found a Lycan observatory on top of Watchtower Rock. The archivist had...died, before we found it, but left a note asking us to care for it.” She shrugs, “You know how we are; we certainly weren’t going to let an archive go to waste. So we’ve been trying to make sense of it. We had a bit of disguised help,” she grins at the Lycan, “And we’ve been making progress. But there’s...a lot that we’re missing. We don’t have the context for. So...I asked Luna. And she...answered.” </p>
    <p>Anasatri fidgets with one of her bracelets, looking down. “I...feel like I was told things in confidence. I don’t want to hold things back, but...I don’t want to betray that.” She looks over at the Tourist, clearly distressed, “There’s...there’s something wrong. I saw Luna speaking to a white wolf. Then something...happened. And the wolf fell. And landed where I found Allophryne last night.” She took a breath, “She also showed me star patterns. One of them matched up to Surt on the date of the potluck, which is where we were. I’m not sure why I needed to be there, but I was. Maybe I’ll figure it out later? That’s usually how it works. I don’t know that I had to be here at a specific time, but I wanted to try to make it by the full moon, and we did. I’d assumed the white wolf was you,” she nods to the Tourist, “And you might still be. But last night, She pointed a moonbeam at Allophryne, and we talked for awhile.” She grimaces, trying to choose her words well, “She...Luna...needs help.”</p>
    <p>The Tourist stares at her, “She… talked to you?” </p>
    <p>“Not talked. There was a connection, unmistakably. But...silence. The vision was a dream, and it was all images, things she wanted me to see. No words.”</p>
    <p>“I think I’d prefer that...” Allophryne grumbles.</p>
    <p>"Then…" the Tourist's voice is unsteady, "It's not just me. I haven't heard Mother's voice in over a decade. I had thought that I… thought I had failed her, that she… but, if it's not just me…" she trails off with a terrified expression on he face. </p>
    <p>“It’s not just you. The archivist’s message said the same thing. She hadn’t heard anything either.” Anasatri rubs her hands together uncomfortably, “It’s...it’s an outside force, I think?” She looks pained, “She brought me here, brought <i>us</i> here. Surely it’s...all right to tell you?” She looks up at the Tourist, worried and hoping for an answer.</p>
    <p>"I trust everyone here," the Tourist states, "I have trusted Her guidance for many, many years. We aren't here as an accident."</p>
    <p>She pauses, "I suppose I should act like it, then."</p>
    <p>She looks up, giving both Allophryne and Anasatri a quiet gaze before speaking, "My name is Bryti." </p>
    <p>“Bryti. I’ll tell you what I saw, but it’s...going to hurt. A lot.” Anasatri takes a deep breath and closes her eyes, “I saw Luna, in her realm. She let me fly to where she is, and showed me the ancestors in the stars. They were all in their places, but the wolf approached Her. She appeared, the Mother, to greet the wolf. Then the wolf changed, like snow drifting down. The Huntress, maybe.</p>
    <p>“But something was wrong. Something angry, and painful. There’s a black wolf coming over the horizon. It’s enormous, bigger than her, as large as the world, and it has silver fangs. It attacks Her.”</p>
    <p>Anasatri wraps her arms and wings around herself, shivering, reliving the vision, “There’s so much pain, and sorrow, and betrayal. As the black wolf bites Her, cracks cover her form. But the white wolf started to fall away, drifting into snow and stardust. The Mother reached for her, but it was too late.</p>
    <p>“So much pain, the Mother’s form fades, and the black wolf keeps biting. The ancestors in the stars writhe and cry out, some of them vanishing. Darkness covers Her until there’s...nothing. Just a blackness in the sky. She’s dying, and it hurts so much.”</p>
    <p>Her breath hitches a few times before she can go on, “The black wolf is many wolves, millions and millions of them, tearing Her out of the sky. The white wolf continues to fall, shedding snow and light, and lands here. As it lands, the black wolf roars and shakes and begins to fall apart. It looks at me, it sees me, and it hates me. Then it dies, falling apart and burning.</p>
    <p>“Then there are stars, so many, thousands and thousands of starfields she shows me, all still in my mind so I can remember, so I could find where She needed me. It hurts so much, but She hurts She hurts and She’s dying and She needs help and-!”</p>
    <p>Anasatri gasps as she wrenches herself back out of the vision, feeling the cold and the pain deep in her bones. </p>
    <p>As her sight returns to the waking world, she sees Bryti sitting in front of her. There are tears running down her face. She slumps her shoulders and places her face in her hands.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Mother," her voice shudders, "What have we done to you?" </p>
    <p>Anasatri shifts forward to put her arms and wings around the other woman, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…” </p>
    <p>Litoria places a webbed hand on Bryti's back, a slow, sad gesture of support.</p>
    <p>Bryti quietly accepts the support, from both of them. She lets her tears flow in silence for several minutes before she is able to respond.</p>
    <p>"Vigr, my older brother," she takes an unsteady breath, "He would call me snowfluff."</p>
    <p>Litoria doesn’t know how to respond to this statement without causing more pain.  So she removes her murdering hand.</p>
    <p>Bryti raises her head to look at Litoria. The two share a painful look that Anasatri can't read. Bryti slowly moves her hand to touch Litoria's, then almost timidly moves to bring her into a hug. </p>
    <p>Litoria nervously hugs the <s>werewolf</s> elf back.  It’s not an apology, because nothing could ever apologize for that.  But it’s something.  And it’s something she accomplishes without accidentally moving to strangle the other woman either.  And that’s progress.</p>
    <p>Anasatri moves one wing to make room for Litoria, but otherwise stays where she was.  Allophryne sits and hugs his knees awkwardly, not making eye contact with anyone.</p>
    <p>Bryti's breathing slows and becomes steady again. She lifts her head slightly and touches her forehead to Litoria's. She takes a slow breath and looks to Anasatri.</p>
    <p>"Thank you," she says, "For not holding back." </p>
    <p>There are dark circles under Anasatri’s eyes as she leans back, “You’re welcome.” She moves to sit next to Bryti, keeping a wing across her back if she doesn’t object.</p>
    <p>She does not. Bryti sits in quiet contemplation, holding Litoria's hand.</p>
    <p>"I… don't understand the vision," she admits, "not all of it. I think I may be able to help you, though. The black wolf… you said you saw its eyes. What color were they?" </p>
    <p>“Gold. Bright gold.” She shudders, remembering that furious glare.</p>
    <p>"Dreyrugr," Bryti literally growls, "He had black fur and yellow eyes. Teeth of silver…"</p>
    <p>She glances at Litoria before continuing, "My mother was a Lycan Skati. My father was a blade elf Warmaster. They were married. We… we were loyalists, but to the Empire, not to Dreyrugr. At some point, it wasn't…"</p>
    <p>She pauses, "I was away when Dreyrugr came for my family. When I returned, I found their bodies left to rot. Scattered about them, there were silver weapons. Dreyrugr's soldiers used silver to slaughter my family. From the sound of your vision… that may not have been the only time." </p>
    <p>“Oh Goddess, but why?” She puts her hand to her mouth, “I’m sorry, you don’t have to answer that.”</p>
    <p>"I met that beast once," a slight shudder travels down Bryti's back, "Saw his eyes. Luna showed you that. What a monster behind eyes like that could be capable of."</p>
    <p>She pauses and frowns, "But Dreyrugr is dead. One person, no matter how vile, can't do that to a Goddess. In your vision, you saw that the black wolf was actually millions of wolves. I think… I think that means that there were many more like him. Many more who enabled him, allowed someone like that to take power, followed his orders… didn't do enough to stop him." </p>
    <p>“Didn’t he just...take over? I thought that was how the...ah, the Empire worked.” She winces, remembering that this is in fact a Lycan she’s talking to.</p>
    <p>Bryti furrows her eyebrows, "Yes. Yes it did. Maybe that is what Luna was trying to show you? The world we created rewarded the most cruel and violent among us. It created beasts like Dreyrugr, and fed their appetites. It made his depravity inevitable. Is that… is that what is killing her? That her children became monsters?" </p>
    <p>“Would that include, maybe, thems that ain’t in your culture too, weh?”  Allophryne looks up at the others.  “Like...”</p>
    <p>“Ars Khafra.”  Litoria nods.  “Them still claimed ta’ worship the moon, e’en if they done called Her by a different name.”</p>
    <p>“But what do we do?” Anasatri asks quietly. “What <i>can</i> we do?”</p>
    <p>"Like Calestros, we are many different children with one Mother. We may see her differently, but we all see the same moon," Bryti closes her eyes, "And I have no idea what to do. It was so much simpler a few weeks ago when all I thought I had to do was kill afflicted until the end…"</p>
    <p>“Why not jus ask Calestros?”  Allophryne asks with a shrug.</p>
    <p>Anasatri sighs, “Baijani did. She said ‘Make sure she’s okay’. Whether that ‘she’ is Luna or Bryti or me or someone entirely different, I have no idea. Certainly worth trying again.” She drums her fingers on her knee, “I have some spells I could try as well, if we can keep imposing on you, Litoria?”</p>
    <p>Litoria takes her turn to shrug.  “We’re stuck here till the wounded heal up a bit, weh.”</p>
    <p>“The moon will still be full tonight,” she glances at Bryti and Allophyne, “Maybe one of us will get...something.” She bites her lip, “I had another thing I wanted to ask you about, Bryti, but it’s not as urgent and can wait.”</p>
    <p>"Of course," Bryti replies, "I will be staying until the wounded are out of danger. After that, I have to resume my mission. I wasn't able to corral all of the affected into the ambush. A few individuals and small groups managed to escape during the drive. I will have to deal with them. Until then, though, I would be glad to talk to you." </p>
    <p>“Great, I’ll come find you later. I should go talk with Eina and Smilisca; I might need to borrow some spell components that I don’t have on me if they can spare something…” She smiles, sad at first, but then bright with more than a hint of mischief, “Enjoy your sparring! I’ll see you around too Allophryne!”</p>
    <p>Bryti returns a smirk, “We will, Loremaster.”</p>
