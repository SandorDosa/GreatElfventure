<h1>A Possible Connection</h1>

<p><i>"We have been raided by coyote elves. Our shipment of textiles to you will be delayed. Our apologies for the inconvenience."</i></p>

<p>"WHAT?"Shadimon lunged for the feather, as if grabbing it would make more of a message appear. "Goddess bless it what happened?" The enchantment would only allow for short messages, so he paused briefly to scribble out a rough reply.</p>

<p><i>"Need scouts? Can find out where they are and keep watch."</i></p>

<p>He put the feather back in its tiny stand on the table and sighed, then scowled. <i>What in Her name is a coyote elf? First wolf elves, now coyote elves?</i></p>

<p>The feather chirped again, and this time Hunger's voice came through: <i>"Another triotrade? We could use scouts, could provide military support to deter raids."</i></p>

<p>There was a sheet of paper tucked under the feather's stand, and Shadimon jotted down the latest messages with dates. A waxed tablet nearby served as his to-do list, and he made a note to talk to their resident dreamdust elves. He expected there would be a dream-message from Dust that evening; while those were only one-way, it was still much faster than even flying messengers.</p>

<p><i>Probably send rangers. If Surt is sending military support they'll be more effective than we will. But if we can find these people, that will be a greater good.</i></p>

<p>He tapped the stylus on the table, thinking. A bookcase had been carved into the wall, and tucked to the side of one of the shelves was a small copper star.</p>

<p><i>Gabe Cazarez 
Coldwater Sheriff</i></p>

<p><i>Coldwater. That was a town marked on the map, but there wasn't much information on it, and we suspected it had been damaged by Lycan occupation or retreat. I suspect that's where these Coyote elves are coming from.</i> He palmed the small star and tucked it into one of his belt pouches. </p>
