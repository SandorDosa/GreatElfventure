<h1>How the Flappies Got Their Wings, a Creation Myth</h1>

<p>Back when the winds were still and the sky was silent, when the World was new and gods walked among the people, the elves were one and they were loved.</p>

<p>Calestros the elven creator lived and breathed among Her children. She adored the elves, and lavished on them Her love and gifts, desiring only that they never want for anything. She watched in delight as Her children embraced the natural beauty of the world, studying, learning it, and in learning, improving. Their artistry was unparalleled, and they repaid their Mother’s love with gifts and devotion of their own.</p>

<p>And so it went, each new generation loving Calestros and being loved in return. But as time went on, the elves began to notice discontent in their Mother.</p>

<p>“Mother,” they cried, “What saddens you?</p>

<p>“I grieve for you,” She replied, “That your lives should pass by so quickly.”</p>

<p>The elves hastened to reassure Her; their lives were enriched by Her presence, and that was reward enough for them.</p>

<p>But the grief continued to gnaw at Calestros until She could stand it no more. She told Her children that She must go, but that She would return. The elves sorrowed to see it, but bid Her safe journey.</p>

<p>And so Calestros went, out into the sky between the stars, seeking the knowledge that would save Her children from the agony of Death. She searched, long for gods and even longer for mortals. At last She found the knowledge She sought, but Her joy turned to horror. Some things are meant to be hidden even from gods, and the knowledge of it was too much.</p>

<p>Thus came the Shattering. In Her desperation, Calestros flung Her gift to Her children, granting them long lives. But in doing so, She also gave them Her madness. The elves were shattered along with their Mother, fracturing and dividing into many races, each a broken reflection of the mirror shards of Calestros’ mind.</p>

<p>In the ensuing chaos, Calestros retreated away from Her people, trying to shield them from Herself. She fled to Her home, a beautiful place that had once been open to all elves, and now became a prison. There She raged and wept and grieved for what She had done, for what She had inflicted on Her beloved children. </p>

<p>And there She would have stayed, alone and trapped with Her madness. But some of Her children reached out to Her. They had called to Her, but Her answers were painful and disjointed, Her once-beautiful voice a ruin. Many of the elves turned their focus inward, trying to find their new place in a world without the guiding love of their Mother. But some refused to let Her fall.</p>

<p>A small group of elves sought Her out. All elves knew where to find Her home, and they went. But in order to try to protect Her children, Calestros had caused Her home to be lifted into the sky, connected to the ground by nothing but a delicate stair. Undeterred, the elves climbed. Night and day, until they reached the top. There they nearly failed; they could hear Calestros’ grief, and the grief of a god is a physical thing, wounding them as surely as any weapon.</p>

<p>They begged Her to let them in, to let them help Her, but She refused. She knew that they were suffering, but Her presence would break their hearts. Calestros begged them to leave, to protect themselves and leave Her to Her mistake, but they refused.</p>

<p>For ages they waited, until finally they could stay no more. Finally they had no choice but to leave their Mother. Their grief and Hers weighed them down as they started heavily down the long stairs. But the home of a god is a reflection of their Self. As they descended, Calestros was overtaken by Her madness, and the structure beneath their feet began to weaken. They were much too far from the ground, and they clung together and cried out their final love to their Mother as the stairs crumbled and they fell.</p>

<p>In Her home, Calestros heard their voices. In desperation, She tore at Her wings, flinging Her feathers out into the wind. Where they blew past the elves, they clung and became wings. Safe through one final gift from their Mother, the newly-flighted elves glided safely to the ground, looking up in time to see Calestros’ home crumble and vanish.</p>

<p>These were the first of the winged elves. Ever after, they turned their eyes to the sky, listening for Her voice as they rode the winds.</p>
