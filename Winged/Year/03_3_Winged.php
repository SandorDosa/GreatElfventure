<p>Shrike kicked her feet up on the table, leaning back against the cushions, "I have to admit to curiosity and concern. You're not prone to inviting people over."</p>

<p>Shadimon snorted, "You act like I'm some socially-inept idiot."</p>

<p>Shrike gestured broadly, taking in the mostly undecorated, empty home, and raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"See this is why I <i>don't</i> invite you over."/p>

<p>Shrike laughed and sat up, "So is there a reason or did you just want company other than your pretty assistant?"</p>

<p>"Both." He sat down next to her and pulled over a map of Asavardi and the surrounding areas. Their rangers had been doing good work. "So, word from Riverhaven. Coyote isn't going to be able to come in force this season or probably next. He has to replenish his riders and call in militia. Because of course he has an actual army. This is good info because Dust got it directly from the spies they captured."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad he's on our side because he would be terrifying if he wasn't."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the Coyotes are figuring that out. Now, Coyote wants those refugees. The village that used to be at the Grove was refugees that he came after and massacred. So Riverhaven will probably be the first target."</p>

<p>"But we've been hit too." Shrike had leaned forward, intensely focused on the map. "And we need to be prepared for that."</p>

<p>"Exactly. You were here for the first attack and I wasn't. That entire thing was Breaker's plan, and she's...well, not necessarily on our side, but not <i>against</i> us. Also confirmed solidly by Dust. But Coyote is smart. Breaker's attack ultimately failed, and you've filled me in on steps that were taken to make sure it couldn't happen again." He looked up at her, "I want you in charge of planning defenses."</p>

<p>She started, pulling back to look at him, "Me? Why not you?"</p>

<p>"Because you people want me as a leader, which means I have more to do and can't focus entirely on this. I've talked to Jani and Harinarya. Hari said you were all over the place during and after the attack, and I know you assembled a new unit, took them up to Alfyr, and managed their training there and worked to get them integrated with the Harriers. Why <i>not</i> you?"</p>

<p>She floundered, and Shadimon got some distinct amusement out of seeing her so off-balance. "But...Hari is your Second in the Harriers. Wouldn't he be first in line?"</p>

<p>"Hari is going to be Harrier-First. I'm sure you haven't been managing every aspect of the Skyhawks." He shook his head, "You've always looked too far ahead for that." He grinned, "I know this because I also talked to <i>your</i> Second, and got a cheerfully detailed account of Ehra declaring you a Master war scholar, in addition to seeing how you carried yourself during those war games." He tilted his head, "Modesty has never been one of your faults before. What happened?"</p>

<p>"It's...I don't know...I...Wait did you just call me arrogant?"</p>

<p>Shadimon laughed and threw his arm around her shoulders, "I did and you know it's true. So why is it not all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>"I'm...impulsive. Angry. I leap headfirst into things and just hope that I don't crash. How is that useful for an actual leader?"</p>

<p>He tilted his head, studying her face as she tried to avoid looking at him, "You do remember that I never chose this, don't you? Me, Kirien, Irandiriel, the others...none of us were chosen or actively chose to be leaders. It had to be done, and no one else was doing it. You do the same. You've shown that you can do it, and even Ehra gave you his seal of approval. You have actual military training. The rest of us were flying blind and learned the currents as we went. So again, why not you?"</p>

<p>Shrike dragged her hands over her face and let out a long breath before leaning back toward the map, "All right. In that case, here are my ideas..."</p>

<p>Defensive operations of Conventional Warfare to prepare and plan for the possibility of another attack. Ex: mapping out potential approaches, investigating the palisade to see if it can be used, planning and running drills between the Harriers and Skyhawks, etc etc. Rolling 1 ability: 0 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs; Fate point reroll: 0 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

<p>Amenidal,</p>

<p>Hi! I hope you're doing well. Sorry we didn't get to talk at the last potluck; I had too much on my mind.</p>

<p>So, I don't know if this came up when you were visiting us here, but I've been playing with the idea of starting a library, based around the archive we're working with at the Observatory. Did you hear about that? We found a Lycan observatory, complete with telescopes, star charts, some giant arcane orrery thing, and lots of magic references! It's amazing!</p>

<p>Anyway, there's a huge archive built under it. We've been working on trying to understand how it's organized - there's a <u>ton</u> of information in here - and it gave me the idea of organizing what I know. Getting it all written down, so we have records. But more than that, I also want to use this as a chance to record what we <u>all</u> know. All the elves. Just imagine it! All of that information all in one place just <u>waiting</u> for <u>anyone</u> to come by and learn it! We could turn it into a school like the academy at Alfyr!</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought this might be something you might be interested in! And your uncle; you talked about him being a Chronicler for your people, so I'm sure he has tons of stories to share! I remembered that you had talked about wanting to learn about other elf cultures, which is something I'm interested in too. Maybe sometime in the future we could get together and compare notes? Put some books together?</p>

<p>Oh, I had this same conversation with Ink when he came to visit. He gave me the first official contribution! A book of poetry! You've <u>got</u> to see it someday!</p>

<p>Hope things are good over there. Come see us again sometime!</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b></p>
<p>Your researchers hear that there are many winged elves who would like to live at the Watchtower for the perceived sense of safety. This is immediately terrifying to the researchers. They are standing on a treasure trove of knowledge that they do not understand, and dozens or even hundreds of new arrivals could absolutely destroy information they don't even know to look for, or make the observatory unusable.</p>

<p>The researchers scramble to stake out their territory and restore as much of the observatory as they can. They enlist help from some of the architects that helped Asavardi to get where it is. They work on reinforcing and restoring the observatory building itself. Austere monastic architecture may have suited Lycan monks, but winged elves are a bit different. They do try to maintain as much of the original architecture as possible, they just look to make it a bit homier and a bit safer. Also a bit less freezing in the winter.</p>

<p>They also enlist the architects to help them in planning for when more buildings need to be constructed at the Watchtower. This location was specifically chosen for its remoteness and unobstructed view of the sky. It wouldn't do to cram a noisy town with a bunch of torches and lanterns all around it.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while examining the top of the Watchtower, the architects notice something that the researchers hadn't. Those old stone monoliths are laid out in some kind of pattern, spanning most of the top of the plateau. A couple are broken and several are fallen over, so they can't quite piece together what it's for yet, but with a little help they should be fixed up. Sure would be nice if one of your research had made friends with possibly literally the only person left alive who knows something about these things...</p>

<p>Anyway, the architects come up with a plan for building the settlement itself into the sides of the Watchtower. Over time, they can build larger structures and stores by digging steadily deeper into the Watchtower itself. By setting them back deeper into the stone cliff face and carefully designing the ceilings and balconies to direct light down, you should be able to keep light pollution from reaching the observatory. Still might need to set some ground rules for blackout nights. It won't be any harder than creating the cliff houses in Asavardi, it just might take longer. It should also happen automatically when you grow the settlement. An Aspect isn't really necessary, as the Watchtower itself is an Aspect and can be invoked for pretty much anything defensive.</p>

<p>The Ruined Observatory has been converted to a Restored Observatory, though the monoliths and the Orrery have yet to be repaired. The Observatory itself is in much better condition now, and even a few of the telescopes have been restored. Stargazing is now quite possible from the Observatory, but without the Orrery it seems to lack context.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b></p>
<p>The Skywatchers are still a fledgling organization, but they take to the skies in force. They are determined to make up for previous shortfalls and mistakes. With a stunning amount of organization for a group of winged elves, they set up patrols, command structures, reporting schedules, and duty rosters. It's all actually rather impressive.</p>

<p>Their first order of duty is the one most personal to them: Making sure Asavardi is secure. They believe they caught the only mole, but Coyote made significant threats suggesting he may have more. They spend most of the season checking for more.</p>

<p>In the end, they're successful: You have determined that there was only the one mole. Asavardi is safe.</p>

<p>The longer range patrols scouting the edge of winged elf territory do see a rider or two, but they always turn back and flee before reaching the ward. Coyote may be trying to keep an eye on you, but it wasn't as serious an effort as he's made before. Your settlements are secure.</p>

    <p><b>Military:</b></p>
<p>Now to make sure those assholes don't just come charging up the canyons again...</p>

<p>Actually restoring the palisade is possible, but it'll take an Economics: Infrastructure check to Establish something there, maybe even a gateway outpost so that if they are attacked, a warning can be sent out. For now, your patrols build a makeshift wood and stone wall there. At the very least, anyone who breaks through it in force would have to stop and knock it down, slowing them down and maybe giving some warning.</p>

<p>Other than that, the Skyhawks and Harriers take to the sky. They go over the routes the Coyotes attacked from before, and a few others that they could possibly think of. With the Skyhawks, it's easier. More wings, more eyes, more distance covered.</p>

<p>All in all, thankfully, other than a few Coyote scouts seen poking at the edges of your territory, it stays quiet this season in the canyons. As the season draws to a close, intelligence gathered from the dreamdust elves suggests that the Coyotes may not be able to hit Asavardi right now, and are almost certainly going for Riverhaven.</p>

<p>Your soldiers are torn between wanting to hit the Coyotes back and not wanting to leave the bulk of Asavardi's military forces away from home. Still, their leaders will make that decision.</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b></p>
<p>Engineering isn't one of your strong suits, but planning and obsessive curiosity is!</p>

<p>A quick trip over to the fallhopper at Oarsman's Rest gives your research team some ideas. The Goldfall river flows strong through this area, and rain water collected in cisterns at the top could be filled into buckets and used as counterweights, to be easily emptied at the bottom. Water could power a lift and pulley system pretty easily, and hey, guess who knows a shitload about engineering with water and is gonna be coming by soon!</p>

<p>You are able to come up with a cohesive plan for how best to utilize such a pulley system, including the most convenient locations for them, what rock outcroppings are the most stable and safe to put them on, and how best to organize their loading and unloading for quick transport. As well as actually designing and building the things, well...hey, you have friends.</p>

<p>Even better, knowing that the river elves are actually going to be here soon, you research team actually goes outside and talks to people. Yes indeed, they actually talk to the farmers, miners, and traders who could best utilize those transport systems. They go the extra mile of actually gathering supplies for building them, including some sturdy darkwood that could make the project much easier and safer. Additionally, they construct safety harnesses and collect climbing gear that'll probably make the river elves feel way safer!</p>

<p>The plans you create will provide an upgrade on the check to build a cargo pulley system. Further, you have a Construction Supplies temporary aspect that can be invoked to assist in building the actual thing. Nice! </p>
