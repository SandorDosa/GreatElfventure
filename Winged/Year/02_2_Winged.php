<p>We have immigrants, more on the way, and a big new discovery. Let’s keep up that momentum!</p> 

<p>Using the Investment trapping of the Infrastructure skill to get that garden up and rolling. Rolling 2 ability, plus 2 boost dice: 5 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

<p>The observatory and archive is a potentially priceless find, and the perfect excuse to establish an outpost on Watchtower Rock. A group of academics (picked by lottery from those able to speak Skaplyndi) are sent to settle in and start working on the archives. A handful of rangers are also detached to accompany them, keep watch, and make sure everyone actually pauses to eat.</p>

<p>Using the Establishment trapping of the Infrastructure skill to make the observatory liveable and establish a presence on the rock. Rolling 2 ability: 1 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Ok no really, guys, we need to be better about this.</p>

<p>Cloak and Dagger trapping of Spycraft. Rolling 1 ability: 2 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Military: </b>Everything near the Watchtower looks abandoned, but one Lycan outpost might have some support nearby, and by now we’ve heard about these ‘Coyote elves’. So who the fuck knows what else might be going on over there. We’ll give the pathfinders a rest, and assign someone of the Watchtower rangers to investigating the area immediately around the Tower.</p>

<p>Ranger trapping of Reconnaissance to explore the area between the Watchtower and Asavardi. Rolling 2 ability and 1 proficiency: 2 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> Oh boy, so now there’s this big archive of...stuff. Useful stuff? Maybe, but interesting! It’s a puzzle!</p>

<p>Research trapping of Academics to start trying to organize, sort, and examine the scrolls in the archive. Rolling 3 ability: 0 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

<p>Asavardi: Well. No one said carving life out of a bare cliff face was gonna be easy. Even the unflappable flappies are getting a wee bit peeved at how this cliffside gardens project keeps mucking up in increasingly plausible ways.</p>

<p>You had it! You had the irrigation figured out! Greywater drainage, gutters and spouts carved into the rocks, basins at the clifftops. You had the right soil types and planter sizes for each garden, you had everything accounted for!</p>

<p>And nothing grew!</p>

<p>Augh! It was probably some stupid fungus or something. Your gardeners throw out their soil and decide that hopefully things will go better next time. Honestly, it was mostly bad luck.</p>

<p>Your gardens are sort of done. The construction part is complete anyway, all that’s left is actually getting plants in the damned things.</p>

<p>The difficulty will be reduced by one (to zero mind you) permanently, though gods help us if that comes up more than once. You will also have a bonus die on your next attempt, as it appears at least one of your gardeners now has some kind of plant-based rage ability.</p>

<p>Watchtower: Congratulations! You have successfully founded a new outpost at Watchtower Rock!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Name:</b> Watchtower Rock</li>
<li><b>Description:</b> The outpost at Watchtower Rock is centered on the observatory itself, though a few scattered sketches on paper and some lines in the dirt suggest more buildings are being planned.</li>
<li><b>Size:</b> Outpost</li>
<li><b>Territory Aspects:</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Ruined Observatory:</b> This mysterious structure contains much to discover, but the building itself is also in good condition and provides safe if humble accommodations.</li>
<li><b>Mount Fuckoff:</b> You know what this one means.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Settlement Aspects:</b> Empty Slot</li>
<li><b>Garrison:</b> One slot empty</li>
</ul> 

<p>In addition, since the building itself turns out to be easily large enough to safely accommodate your research team, they barely need most of the supplies they bring. You will have a bonus die on your next check to improve this settlement.</p>
<h3 id="jump2">Event: <a href="../Bonus/10_Family Ties.php">Family Ties</a></h3>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Shadimon has some <i>work to do</i>. While he alone is aware of the exact events of this season, potential flaws in Asavardi's security have been made readily apparent. With the excuse of another accidental dreamdust elf incursion, Shadimon organizes a round of penetration testing and extra training from patrols. Including, for no particular reason, a simulated event where the Tourist tries to climb the walls of Asavardi. No reason.</p>

<p>"Dusk's" visit did not count as Espionage and doesn't waste any bonuses, and Shadimon's motivation will provide a boost die on your almost certain cloak and dagger check next turn.</p>

    <p><b>Military:</b> This, mercifully, goes extremely well. Your Rangers carefully scout their marked sectors, and also mercifully find nothing. It is quite clear that no one has been to this area in some time. The only sign of humanoids is from the dreamdust elves that were there recently. Everything else is essentially wild, untamed terrain. Interestingly, there’s not a single road or path in the area, much less up the tower itself. Judging that the Keeper you found was a wereowl, it may just be that the observatory was designed to be only accessible to fliers. Odd that.</p>

<p>Regardless, your Rangers actually accomplish their assigned sectors early and take it upon themselves to scout a little further. They have successfully scouted one more square (ranged squares are marked in red on your map) and will have a bonus die if you wish to do more ranging next turn.</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> (Note: The assistance the mysterious elf “Dusk” gave you proved quite helpful. It ended up saving your researchers a great deal of time in sussing out the basics, and a much better idea of what they were looking at in general. Her help gave you a bonus die, which rolled 2 advantage.)</p>

<p>While they haven’t resolved any of the great mysteries, the catalog system at least seems to have vomited up its secrets. Your researchers are able to successfully sort out the broad scope of information that they have in the archive. As Dusk said, it seems to fall into two broad categories. The first is the more “mundane” astronomical data. This is all mostly mathematical and is something your elves seem to have a decent enough concept of. They believe it may have applications for scouting, pathfinding, predicting weather and seasons, measuring time, and similar practical uses.</p>

<p>The other category, well, it’s a bit more esoteric. The Lycans appear to have been cross-referencing astrological data with religious text in very strange ways. These records are kept separately from the more cut and dry archives, so it’s clearly something to do with the more magical uses of the Observatory. Your researchers decline to comment on the idea of using Lycan religious practices, but a few of your more arcane oriented researchers note that there is very clear arcane design in many of the diagrams. They believe that the Observatory may have  been designed for use in amplifying magical rituals. How, exactly, they aren’t sure. It’s a theory, for now.</p>

<p>Regardless, Dusk’s information combined with the excellent work from your researchers means you have not one but two Upgrades available, one on your next attempt to do something with the Archive and one on your next attempt to repair the Orrery. The check to repair the Orrery will be an Economics (Enrichment) check, and this upgrade will stack with other bonuses. Dusk was right. Lycan math starts with the moon and works backwards.</p>
