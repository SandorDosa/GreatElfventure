     <p><b>Character:</b>
     <p><b>Anasatri: Letter to the Editor</b></p>

<p>Anasatri arrived to the Watchtower early in the spring. Thuridan and the other researchers were thrilled to see her, and quickly gave her a tour of the entire place. The basement archive itself had been partially converted into temporary living spaces. “It gets damned cold here in the winter,” Thuridan grumbled. “At least down here it stays warm enough. No fireplaces, of course, but we have braziers and blankets enough.”</p>

<p>Most of the work had been done in the archive; shelves and sections had been labeled, and the slate on the wall was covered in notations. Each shelf had a piece of paper tacked on it with notes of what was where, and there was a master list of decoded meanings of the Lycan filing system.</p>

<p>The first week of her stay was spent in the archive helping. They had split the records into straightforward charts and more esoteric accounts, and were focusing on the charts for the time being. They didn’t seem to be sorted by location or time, so a great deal of time was spent cataloging that information along with where they had been found on the shelves.</p>

<p>“There’s a reason for it, there has to be, but we haven’t figured it out yet,” Naleryn told her. “We’re compiling as much information as we can in the hopes that a pattern will show up eventually. Something based on the moon, we thought, but there isn’t a pattern there yet either. If only we had someone to ask.”</p>

<p>Anasatri looked across the room, skimming the shelves.</p>

<p><i>When you don’t know, ask.</i></p>

<p>It was practically the official motto of the winged elves. <i>If you don’t know, ask.</i></p> 

<p>Her eyes caught on the grey feather hanging near the stairs, <i>If only the Loremaster had survived...</i> Suddenly she knew what to do.</p>

<p>Anasatri was an oracle, and her powers were as mysterious to her as to anyone else. But there were times that she just Knew things. It was like finding a friendly windstream, and her feathers shivered.</p>

<p><i>When you don’t know, ask. Ask the source.</i></p>

<p>~~</p>

<p>She waited a few more days until the full moon, making preparations. She didn’t need to plan; that had all been part of the flash of insight. She waited until the others had moved back down to the archive for the night, and took herself and her supplies up to the observatory dome. Everyone knew she was up to something, but left her alone when asked.</p>

<p>It wasn’t time yet, so she paced around the room. Very little had been done; most of the cogs and gears from the broken machine were still where they had fallen. <i>Was it intentional, I wonder? Taken apart on purpose? Or vandalism? Or just time?</i> There were shelves in the room, most of them empty. Scattered papers had been swept up along with the layer of dust, but not much else had been disturbed. Through one of the windows, she finally saw the full moon peek over the horizon. While she waited for it to fully rise, she found a clear space in the center of the room and sat down.</p>

<p>She relaxed her wings, letting them drape around her like a cape of feathers. On her lap she had one of the star charts, a physical embodiment of the knowledge she was seeking. She put a blank piece of paper on the floor in front of her and picked up a charcoal stick. As the moon fully rose, she blew out the small lamp she had brought, and waited for her eyes to adjust to the dim light. A faint breeze came through the windows, rustling her feathers, and she closed her eyes and focused on it.</p>

<p>She focused on Seeking, spreading her feathers to catch that ethereal wind, and felt the floor fade out from under her. The world around her seemed to fade into mist, and she spread her wings to glide through it. Out into that mist, she sent her call.</p>

<p><i>Luna, my name is Anasatri. I’m sure you can see me here in your observatory. We’ve inherited it from your children, and we don’t want to see it lost. But they’re brilliant, and we don’t understand. It’s full of secrets, and full of You. We don’t know You. I wish to learn, will you speak to me? Will you allow us to save these things?</i></p>

<p>The words faded out into the distance, and Anasatri continued gliding through the fog. Sometimes a clear path appeared, and sometimes it didn’t. She could stay in this place for a certain amount of time, and chose to this time. While she glided, she continued thinking out loud. Talking to Luna? She wasn’t sure. </p>

<p><i>We’re a people of the daytime sky; night is a mystery to us. We see You, we see the stars, but we can’t read them. If we could, maybe we could fly safely at night. This place, it’s huge. We’ve never seen anything like it before. I’d like to see it turn into a place for knowledge. Ours, Yours, anyone’s, all available for people to learn. That’s what I want, I think. I want to learn things, and I want other people to be able to learn things. All the things! If we don’t look outside of ourselves, we’ll miss too many things, and what a waste that would be.</i></i>

<p>She felt a shiver in the wind, and knew her time was running out. <i>Thank you for listening!</i> She glided down through the fog, into dim light, and gradually felt the floor under her again.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Military:</b> The Coyotes are absolutely infuriating to fight, but fight them you do.</p>

<p>The opening weeks of your joint deployment are marked with nigh constant harassing raids, feints, and sabotage. Coyotes come in small groups at random times, harass supply trains, fake charges, and just generally cause trouble. None of these end up being an actual attack, but it gets aggravating.</p>

<p>Damage from this is of course limited. The Charred Eagles do a good job of keeping them away from anything actually important. The winged elf rangers also prove absolute masters of their craft as well. Even though they have well more than a hundred miles of territory to cover throughout the season, they do so with extreme prejudice. More often than not, you have warning that a Coyote harassing attack is coming and are able to react and close ranks.</p>

<p>Frustratingly, actually pinning down the Coyotes when they’re doing one of these raids proves nearly impossible. Over the course of the raids, you get an idea of just how fast the Coyote elf horses are - with a move speed of about 80 in game terms. Even winged elf scouts can’t keep up with that nonsense, and tracking them once they manage to shake visual contact proves nearly impossible. Their habit of using small hills as cover and kicking up small dust storms makes this even worse, allowing them to break contact from even aerial pursuit. People should not be that stealthy on horseback. It should not be legal.</p>

<p>Still, the worst casualty of this phase is the exhaustion. Many of the troops are not used to functioning in this hot of an environment with this aggressive of an operations tempo. It proves taxing on the troops constantly scrambling for raids, and eventually they have had enough. Dust proposes a daring plan and Shadimon and Terror agree, though Shadimon goes to attempt to deliver an ultimatum of some kind to the Coyotes first.</p>

<p>Regardless, a plan like this has a narrow window of opportunity. The fire elves and dreamdust elves cooperate to rig the ambush caravan. The dreamdust elves are a little antsy about setting so many things up to burn, but the fire elves are pumped.</p>

<p>The apparently undefended caravan is sent out. Winged elf rangers spread out to watch for an attack. Dreamdust elves prepare for an ambush and to set the fires. Fire elves prepare for what fire elves do. The Terror is practically vibrating.</p>

<p>The attack comes suddenly, with the Coyotes coming straight at the caravan at full gallop. This attack is not as coordinated as the others, with instead the Coyotes attacking in a massive formation that runs at the head of another massive dust storm. You can see banners with Coyotes embroidered at them flying among the cavalry charge. You may have underestimated them.</p>

<p>They hit the caravan in a ragged formation. Dreamdust elves leap from the wagons, apparently fleeing the attack and leaving the caravan unattended. Coyotes rip open the covers of the wagons to find… fire. Honestly it’s a perfect setup. It could not have gone closer to plan.</p>

<p>The fire elves erupt from the flames. The Terror, in a blur of fire and chain, leaps from the cart and takes charge of the battlefield. With the shock of erupting flames and close combat with anti-cavalry soldiers, the Coyotes are thrown into disarray.</p>

<p>The Terror and her hoplites surround a group of Coyotes - about ten. They call for the Coyotes to dismount and surrender.</p>

<p>One of the Coyotes yells in response: “You’ll get my head off my shoulders before my ass off my horse, pendeja!” </p>

<p>The trapped Coyote riders then proceed to charge the Terror. Not the Elect surrounding her, not in a breakout. They charge her personally. All ten of them.</p>

<p>Terror, with the help of her Elect, is able to survive the attack and still be standing. Most of the trapped Coyotes are killed. Two escape on horseback. Two horses are captured, along with the  Coyote who yelled to start the attack. Terror appears to have gone out of her way to leave that guy alive, and he disappears into fire elf custody.</p>

<p>The remaining Coyotes retreat from the attack in disarray. They do organize and pull their usual disappearing act, but the winged elves notice something off. There are significantly fewer Coyotes than they thought. They appear to be riding in a loose formation, specifically intended to make it look like there are more of them than there actually are.</p>

<p>After conferring with the assembled military leaders, the cause is clear. This is a distraction. The Coyotes wanted you to think that they have a full division active in this region, when clearly they do not. If that division that attacked the nomads isn’t hear, though, where are they?</p>

<p>Oh. Oh no.</p>

<p><b>Under attack! Responding with Defensive Operations!</b></p>

<p>The only warning Asavardi receives is the ward triggering. The watchers deploy immediately, as they are trained to. There are a few minutes of confusion before someone spots it: Dust on the horizon, moving up the canyon. Keen winged elf eyes make out the shapes in the dust storm: Riders. Hundreds of them.</p>

<p>With only minutes to spare, the alarm is sounded. The ladders are pulled up, and the civilians shutter their homes and hide. The Harriers take their weapons and organize, ready to deploy to dissuade the attackers below.</p>

<p>That's when the second prong of the Coyote attack hits. Another large group of riders, at least one maybe two hundred, has approached from the cliff walls above. Suddenly it makes sense. The riders in the canyon were too far away to trip the ward. They were a distraction while the other Coyotes got into position. How in hell are they that stealthy on horseback?</p>

<p>The Coyotes wield heavily recurved longbows, seemingly designed specifically to be fired from horseback. They fire volley after volley at the assembled Harriers, pinning them down before they can take flight. They are forced to take cover on the edges of the cliff face to avoid taking casualties.</p>

<p>With the Harriers pinned down, the Coyotes at the bottom of the cliff take position with their own bows. They create a trap so that both up or down gets you shot. There is a narrow gap in the middle where both groups of archers are at their maximum range of a few hundred feet, but they appear to be very good shots.</p>

<p>A few of your best fliers among the Harriers and the Watchers are able to slip through that gap, but some aren't. After a couple are very tragically and very visibly killed trying to do so, no others make the attempt.</p>

<p>With Asavardi trapped, riders enter the city. Yes, riders on horses move down the narrow cliff paths and walkways of Asavardi. The riding skills of Coyotes apparently can't be overstated, and their horses are thin and agile (and apparently astonishingly well trained.) These riders are led by a tall woman who seems to have particular skill with her horse.</p>

<p>They take hostages. They storm into many of the homes in Asavardi, and particularly the mines. A few minutes later, they toss out the hostages. They have their wings and arms bound and are dangling over dangerous cliff faces.</p>

<p>The leader storms the down hall. She introduces herself a Breaker and makes her demands known to Baijani:</p>

<p>"Hola, pollos," she spoke in a strange dialect Baijani couldn't quite place, "I'm Breaker, and I'm gonna make this real simple. You're in my town now. You and yours are gonna sit still and cool your heels while we go through your stuff and take what we want. We do that, and no one else is gonna die. I got more pollos hanging out, fixin' to see if they can fly without wings. You start getting smart or brave, we start plucking feathers. That clear?" </p>

<p>Baijani has little choice but to accept. She is, however, able to carefully thread the needle between starting a fight and being used like a doormat. Though she is unable to actually intimidate the bandits, Baijani gives them no ground and lets her opinions be known. Breaker seems to find the old woman's courage impressive, and leaves the group in the town hall unharmed.</p>

<p>After the tense standoff Coyotes start raiding the city and taking what they want, particularly the first products of the freshly minted copper mine. They appear unable to use the rapid hit and run tactics that they used on the dreamdust elves (cliffs are bad for that,) so their operation continues until nightfall.</p>

<p>As the sun sets, a group of harriers, watchers, and a few scouts, civilians, and messengers who either escaped or happened to be outside Asavardi when the attack hit assemble a safe distance from the town. Led by Dhakamari, they realize they are the only winged elves able to act. Messengers have been sent out to all allies and Baijani was able to get out a quick message on the feather before town hall was hit, but help is still days away at best. Realizing they are on their own, they consider their options.</p>

<p>It does not take them long to decide what to do. Dhakamari is resolute. The winged elves have only just started to feel safe again. If such a brazen attack goes unchallenged even with the Harriers here, Asavardi will never feel like home again. They can see the hostages. The threat is implicit. They must act decisively.</p>

<p>Some of the elves in the group argue for doing nothing. They believe that the Coyotes won't hurt the hostages if they get what they want. It's safest for them and the hostages noy to act.</p>

<p>In the end, this group is outvoted. The winged elves must act. They must prove that they are not helpless, or this will only happen again.</p>

<p>They take stock of their situation. No help is coming. They have to act quickly. Most of them aren't even armed. There are only about 20 of them. They discover they have only one advantage: This group contains some of the very best fliers Asavardi has.</p>

<p>They have a plan.</p>

<p>They split into two groups. As evening falls, the first group - the civilians and less skilled fliers - create a distraction on the canyon rim. Pretending to be returning hunters, they try to briefly draw the attention of the archers on the canyon rim. It works, but proves to be a costly maneuver. Coyote archers are good shots.</p>

<p>The slowly cooling canyon causes a great thermal in the early evening. The second group uses it to fly as high as possible. They are the most skilled fliers available, with Dhakamari in the front. They pick their targets and drop as fast as possible through the narrow gap where the Coyote archers are least effective. Most make it through. They bank and curve, some slowing literally inches from the canyon wall, and spread out towards the hostages at maximum speed.</p> 

<p>Confused by the sudden desperate assault and distracted by the first group, the Coyotes do not react fast enough. They fire at the dropping elves, but it is disjointed instead of a coordinated volley. Many of the arrows still find their targets.</p>

<p>Dhakamari and most of the group reach the hostages. The Coyotes try to cut them loose, but the fliers have speed on their side. A desperate race ensues to reach them all in time.</p>

<p>Seeing the archers distracted, the Harriers seize the opportunity to break out. They loop upwards and attack the Coyotes on the canyon rim from above.</p>

<p>Breaker seems to realize her momentum is lost. Her group begins to pull back as snipers start taking shots at her, personally. The Coyotes begin to retreat. The Harriers harass them as they pull back along the canyon walls. They wield polearms so it’s hard for the Harriers to use their preferred strategy of knocking people off the wall, but the Harriers make them pay on their way out. Breaker escapes, but many of the Coyotes that came down from the rim end up on the canyon floor below.</p>

<p>The Coyotes regroup quickly once they reach the canyon rim, but a sustained battle appears to have not been their objective. Even though the Coyote forces easily outnumber the Harriers, they break off. They begin to retreat, with several groups going in separate directions.</p>

<p>The Harriers attempt to follow Breaker’s group in force, but the horses move too fast even for winged elves. In the growing dark, the Coyotes kick up dust behind their mounts and move in erratic patterns. Even from a high vantage point, the Harriers lose track of the riders. It's as if they just disappeared. The Harriers pursue them throughout the night with violent intent, but it seems the Coyotes managed to ghost yet again. The Harriers return to Asavardi instead of overextending and leaving it undefended. </p>

<p>In the dim light of dawn, they take stock of Asavardi and their losses.</p>

<p>Thanks to the brave actions of the Harriers and watchers, no hostages were killed in the brief siege. They got to all of them in time, though only just. Several hostages were caught mid-fall, including one Dhakamari caught only a couple dozen feet from certain death.</p>

<p>The Coyotes were stopped before they took much of value or did too terribly much damage. They had to drop most of what they were carrying to make it back to the rim. They paid for the attempt as well. Several Coyote riders were either killed by Harriers or missed their footing and fell during the escape. Grim work had to be done, but Asavardi is safe.</p>

<p>This did not come without costs. Over half of the distraction group was killed by Coyote archers. Many of Dhakamari's group were killed during their bold actions, though most survived. The survivors of both these groups agree: They knew the risks, and knew what had to be done.
The Harriers have taken Light Casualties due to their losses during the fighting. This condition will heal with one full season garrisoned and inactive. </p>

<p>Overall, there are many injuries but fewer outright fatalities. Around 25 or so dead in the attack, the majority of them being Harriers and watchers killed in the fighting. The only civilians killed were those that volunteered for the distraction group.</p>

<p>Baijani takes stock of town hall after the raid and finds that someone ransacked Shadimon's office. They took several potentially valuable documents, a few star chart copies, and possibly the worst loss taken during the siege.</p>

<p>Your feather is missing.</p>

<p>Between your recon and the siege, you learn a couple things about the Coyotes, at least the riders. They wield glaives from horseback by preference, but are good shots with their bows. They wear light armor and their horses are nearly entirely unarmored. The horses are very thin and agile, and also considerably faster than a normal horse with a move speed of about 80 in game terms. Maybe faster in a straight line. Judging by how quickly they made it from Riverhaven to Asavardi, they seem to have no problem holding up that kind of speed over a distance.</p>

<p>They are far, far more than disorganized bandits. They attack with military precision and disappear into the desert with ease. They are well-trained and can execute complicated tactics on the fly. Many of the glaives they wield are silversheen, implying they are war veterans. Their skill in the saddle and control of their horses is unlike anything your elves have ever seen. They rely on speed, violence, and disorienting hit and run tactics to overwhelm foes but they are far from defenseless in a close fight. Tracking them in the expanses of the plains and deserts is nearly impossible, even for an alert flier. They are definitely going to be a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<h3 id="jump2">Event 2.4.1: <a href="../Bonus/8_An Unwelcome Visitor.php">An Unwelcome Visitor</a></h3>

    <p><b>Economic:</b>  The Coyotes trampled the <i>fucking garden</i>. It was almost done! Everything was almost ready! But some fucking <i>lunatics</i> decide that they wanted to ride <i>horses</i> along <i>cliff faces</i>!</p>

<p>Despite Tassimir holding off a few Coyotes for several hours with nothing but a pair of garden trowels, the damage was done. The garden was very nearly up this time too!</p>

<p>Still, they didn’t get all of it. It’s not like they were intentionally targeting gardens, just mostly incidental damage. Next attempt at this ridiculous garden will get an Upgrade because some of the smaller wall gardens were actually successful this time, and a few of the larger ones were outside the areas the Coyotes could get to. It's not enough to be an Aspect, but literally any successes at all will make it so. May the probability gods have mercy on your soul.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Even though he is not here, Shadimon’s influence was a major factor in Asavardi surviving the siege. The watchers played a critical role in passing messages and saving hostages during the siege itself. They also were keeping tabs on Coyotes the whole time.</p>

<p>Shadimon’s motivational messages got through to them not a moment too soon. The penetration testing they did actually gave them an edge: They knew how to get around their home town without being seen. They used this as a critical way to keep information flowing during the siege, which is the reason the Harriers were able to react so quickly when the Coyotes were distracted. Many of the hostages were saved by quick thinking watchers as well.</p>

<p>There is, however, something else.</p>

<p>While they were keeping tabs on Breaker, they saw something extremely disconcerting. Vailenren, one of your watchers, is seen meeting in secret with Breaker. He comes alone in the night carrying a package of some kind and meets with her privately. There is something of an argument between them, but the other watchers can’t hear what is said. Vailenren leaves without being bothered by the Coyotes on guard and without the package.</p>

<p>Shocked, your watchers start putting the pieces together. The Coyote attack on the dreamdust elves, and them somehow knowing where to find the textile shipment. In the initial attack on Asavardi, they knew far too much about the defenses and how to exploit them. How the Coyotes have been seemingly one step ahead of you this entire time. Vailenren was the watcher who disappeared for a few days near the very beginning. He was also the watcher who dropped into town hall to warn Baijani, then disappeared into the back offices.</p>

<p>After learning someone searched Shadimon's office and took the feather, only one explanation makes sense. Vailenren is a mole, and has been for some time.</p>

<p>How you deal with this is up to you.</p>

<p>Regardless, the watchers are in mixed spirits. They are quite proud of the role they played in protecting Asavardi, but after Shadimon’s lessons and the stark revelation of a mole right there in their own ranks, their failings have been laid bare for them to see. They are having long conversations among themselves about what it means to be a watcher, and how they can work towards filling that responsibility well.</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b>  The ritual was nearing completion when the Coyotes attacked. The ritual sites were one of the areas hit. Many of the ritual supplies and components were damaged, stolen, or dumped over the cliffs in the chaos during the siege.</p>

<p>Worse, several of the ritual staff were among those taken hostage and dangled off the edge of the cliff. They are extremely stressed by the experience, to say the least. </p>

<p>With much of the ritual compromised, and much of the staff in severe need of a break to recover from the sudden trauma, the ritual staff decide that they need to call off completing the ward this season. </p>

<p>They understand that this leaves a short gap in ritual coverage and that the importance of the ward was just demonstrated better than ever, but they argue that pushing their casters past their emotional breaking point during a ritual like this is a recipe for disaster.</p>

     <p><b>Character:</b>
     <p><b>Anasatri:</b></p>
<p id="jump"> Anasatri receives <a href="../Bonus/9_A Silent Answer.php">a silent answer.</a> </p>

<p>Over the next few days, Anasatri scans through star charts to try to find some point of reference for the starfields now locked in her head. By chance, she finds a chart made by Viss that seems to show the exact starfield that was visible during the vision. It is at a specific date and location. The location lines up with where Surt is now, on the first day of summer this coming year. The exact date and location of the potluck upcoming in a few months.</p>

     <p><b>Shadimon:</b></p>
<p>Shadimon was correct. The Coyote elves’ base of operations is at Coldwater. Most surprisingly, instead of some lonely bandit outpost this appears to be an actual functional town - and not a tiny one. It is supported by what appear to be a few outlying farms and ranches. Shadimon can see riders patrolling dirt roads.</p>

<p>The city is built around an old fort, made from sturdy looking clay bricks in the style of many of the later Empire frontier forts. This fort not as big as Alfyr, but is a more modern design. There is also an exterior wall of the same construction, shielding most of the town itself. The fort goes all the way up to the water of Lake Coldwater itself, with the exterior walls extending some distance into the lake. There are docks extending into the lake, with what look like small fishing vessels moored.</p>

<p>If he didn't know what these Coyotes were capable of, Shadimon would not have guessed how violent they are from the appearance of the town. He can see colorful buildings made with clay and tile, and narrow brick streets packed with people going about their business. To the north side of the city is some kind of church or temple, decorated with sculptures made of red clay. Honestly it seems kind of pleasant.</p>

<p>As Shadimon flies over, the town erupts with activity. He hears bells ringing from below, and sees guards scrambling to posts. Arrows whiz past him, but he is far too high up for that to be a risk. So much for Coldwater being a quiet homey place.</p>

<p>Just to be safe, Shadimon orders Alenwe to fly a bit higher. Best to split up the pair a bit. None of these guards have much of a chance to hit, but he’ll have to swoop a little lower to drop the message.</p>

<p>He spots what appears to be a garden in the middle of the fort, with a large fountain displayed in the center. Yeah, that’s probably something important. Shadimon swoops to make a pass low enough that wind won’t shred the message or drop it on someone’s roof. He throws it with a practiced hand.</p>

<p>He watches the message clatter to the ground in the garden. He flaps and pulls towards thermals to pull himself back to the safety of higher altitude. He feels warm air fill his wings. More arrows fling past him, but they have practically no chance of hitting him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there is a downdraft. His thermal evaporates to cold air. Okay bad luck but no big deal, trying to soar now will just stall him. He folds his wings and dives, hoping to reach a new thermal. He feels warm air and opens his wings.</p>

<p>Searing pain rips through his left wing. He loses feeling in its leading edge. He glances sideways. There is an arrow jutting halfway through the carpal joint of his left wing. Any attempt to move the wing results in pain so incredible he nearly blacks out. He is falling. </p>

<p><i>How did someone make that shot?</i> He baffles. He was opening his wings in the middle of a dive, still at least two hundred feet up. No one’s that good. It was dumb luck. Sheer, absolute, astonishingly horrible luck.</p>

<p>He forces himself to focus. He’s still high up enough that a fall would kill him. He flares his right wing open and starts a spiraling descent. More arrows whiz past him. He tries to arc his trajectory.</p>

<p><i>Not in the water,</i> he grimaces through the pain, <i>Not the fucking water!</i></p>

<p>He pulls a sluggish turn away from the water. He notices there are no more arrows coming at him. He glances down and sees a group of six riders tracking him on the ground.</p>

<p>Alenwe is diving towards him, but that’s what happened to the arrows. They are much easier targets at this altitude, and there are quite a few arrows incoming. Alenwe is reaching out to Shadimon, about fifty feet above him, when an arrow strikes his thigh. The scout winces and levels off as more arrows target him.</p>

<p>“Fly!” Shadimon signals as he tries to direct his fall, “Get out of here!”</p>

<p>The scout gives Shadimon a grimace of pain and sadness, but obeys his order. He pulls towards a thermal and gains speed and altitude. He’ll escape.</p>

<p>Shadimon can’t move his left wing. He’s going down. Those riders are tracking him as he falls. He opens his right wing as wide as he can and aims as far away from the riders as he manage. He slows his fall, but it only takes off so much momentum.</p>

<p>The ground meets him with a bone crunching impact. He hears his leg snap and feels his shoulder pop out of its socket. Dust fills his mouth. His vision swims red and black, but he wills himself to stay conscious. He’s survived worse crashes than this.</p>

<p>He forces himself to a kneeling position. He grabs the arrow still jammed in his wing and snaps the back half off. He rips the front half through, making a quite unmanly scream in the process. He flexes his wing. It screams in pain but it moves.</p>

<p><i>I can-</i> He hears hoofbeats.</p>

<p>The riders are closing fast. Shadimon can’t run with a broken leg, so he plants his good leg in the dirt and shoves. He gives his wings a flap that brings him off the ground and sends searing pain from his wingtips to his spine. Two more flaps, and he’s getting steady twenty feet off the ground and gaining speed.</p>

<p>That is when the net hits him. The riders have closed the distance already. They’re too fast, far faster than normal light cavalry. Shadimon struggles against the net, but two riders have it lashed firmly to their saddles. They yip commands, and their horses drag to a stop.</p>

<p>Shadimon’s wings are snapped closed by the net. He starts to fall the distance he had lifted off the ground. The dirt rushes up to meet him, head first this time. Shadimon has time for one last thought before he is knocked unconscious by the blow.</p>

<p><i>Just my luck.</i></p>
