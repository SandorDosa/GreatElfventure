    <p><b>Economic:</b> Let’s just...let’s take a break for a bit. Someone found Tassimir lecturing a tray of seeds, and we think maybe he needs a bit to chill out, and winter isn’t the best time for planting anyway. Soooo, how ‘bout them copper veins? Let’s see if we can get some kind of mine-looking setup going.</p>

<p>Using the Investment trapping of the Infrastructure skill to turn copper veins into copper mine. Rolling 2 ability, 1 Upgrade (and difficulty reduced by 1): 2 advantage, 4 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Shadimon rubbed his temples, “I know it was ultimately harmless, but this is <i>twice</i> that people have snuck into places they shouldn’t be. Which, need I remind everyone, involves climbing the cliffs. And <i>somehow</i> no one noticed this.” He suppressed a sigh, “Things have been going well here, from a safety standpoint. But by now all of you have heard the news from the other settlements. There’s a Lycan somewhere, and at least two unknown types of elves who appear to be hostile. Some of these hostile elves have been seen in locations very close to here. If dreamdust elves, who are presumably on drugs, can climb these cliffs and not die, I’m not making any assumptions about a well-planned infiltration.”</p>

<p>He flexed his wings and raked the scouts with a sharp stare, “So. Over the next few months, there are going to be planned attempts to sneak in. I don’t know when, where or who, but I’ll be getting reports from those assistants as they happen. This goes especially for the night-watches. Everyone knows we can’t see well in the dark.”</p>

<p>One of the scouts lifted his hand, “Isn’t the ward set to detect threats in the village?”</p>

<p>“It is, yes, and the mages assure me it’s solid. But I’m not willing to rely on it entirely. So, patrols will continue on the usual schedule. Dismissed.”</p>

<p>Cloak and Dagger trapping of Spycraft. Rolling 1 ability + 1 boost: 3 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs (god dammit WHY)</p>

    <p><b>Military: </b>“Sounds good. Surt sends help to Riverhaven, Riverhaven sends cloth to us, and we send scouts to Surt. I’ll ask them to check in at the Caldera on their way; maybe Shyrendora could use some over-land scouting after they’re done in Surt.” Their copy of the old map was no better than anyone else’s, and the area labeled the ‘Burning Maar’ was minimally detailed. “They’ll need to get better directions from the fire elves when they get there.”</p>

<p>Baijani leaned on the table, “Who are you sending? Dhakamari again?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to ask Varna and Indri to go.”</p>

<p>Her eyebrows went up, “Is that wise, to send the Scoutmaster that far away?”</p>

<p>“This is the first time we’ve really acted with allies. I want to send someone who can make actual decisions, and not have to constantly run messages and ask permission. Will it be necessary? I don’t know. Also…” Shadimon drummed his fingers on the map. “People underestimate Varna.”</p>

<p>Baijani put her chin in her hands, “Now you have me curious. What’s turned you paranoid, that you <i>want</i> our Scoutmaster to be underestimated?”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard all the reports going around. Werewolves, mysterious and apparently hostile elves, random and ominous lurking people and slaughtered bodies.”</p>

<p>“...And?”</p>

<p>“And it’s Surt. The fire elves are easily the least stable group we have. Can you blame me for wanting an eye on what they’re doing? I’m not going to set Varna and his wing to try to actually spy on them. I’m just not going to discourage them from exploring and talking to people. Varna is all enthusiasm, and that’s all that most people see, because it’s honest. But he’s sharp as lightning behind that. He’ll notice things and talk to people, and get a feel for how things are going up there.”</p>

<p>Pathfinder trapping of Reconnaissance to explore the area between Surt and their mineral deposits, and the square to the south of Surt. Rolling 2 ability and 1 proficiency (with stunt use!): 4 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs (fate point to reroll)</p>

<p>Event: A Surtian Flight</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> “The notes from that dreamdust elf were a huge help,” Naleryn said, shuffling through a stack of papers. “Figuring out the cataloging system alone would have taken us months. We still aren’t sure what in Her name they mean by a ‘falling red eye of Luna’ and how that relates to any sort of measurements, but we have the gist of it now.” She gestured to one wall, dominated by a large slate, where they had been chalking notes and lists. “I’ll give them this: many faults they had, but the Lycans made a system of organization and they damn well stuck to it.”</p>

<p>Shadimon and Baijani skimmed through the papers; the two of them had been expressly invited by the researchers for a small tour. “Are we keeping their system or redoing it to something more sensible?” Baijani asked.</p>

<p>“Both, sort of,” the research lead, Thuridan, said. He pushed over a neatly written chart. “We’re keeping their system intact, but adding our own notations. This way we have records on their system in case we find other places like this, but we also have an easier time looking for things ourselves.” His ears splayed slightly, “We don’t want to actively overwrite or lose anything. Lycan or not, it’s still useful knowledge…”</p>

<p>“I think that’s a good choice,” Shadimon nodded. “So, you think that, in addition to just tracking movement of stars, this might have also been an arcane focus?”</p>

<p>“We do! Looking at some of these diagrams,” he pushed over another page, “there’s no question this is some arcane design. But it’s...strange. It looks like some odd mix of arcane and divine magic? There are references to Luna all over the place, and we aren’t sure if that’s actual magic references or religious or just…practical. It’s hard to separate.” Thuridan cast a glance over at the group of researchers clustered around a table, “We aren’t really wanting to mess with that yet. We don’t understand what’s going on well enough, and dabbling in foreign magic without a good guidebook…”</p>

<p>He brightened, “But! We think there is a guidebook in here, somewhere. We just need to interpret it. But right now our priority is figuring out the more mundane applications, with the idea of eventually rebuilding the orrery. Unless you have anything else in mind, that’s what we’re going to continue with.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me. Jani?”</p>

<p>“Practical is good. We’ll leave your group to it.”</p>

<p>“Take your time exploring, if you like, and feel free to come by anytime!”</p>

<p>Research trapping of Academics to continue organizing and figuring out just what the observatory can be used for. Rolling 3 ability + 1 upgrade: 3 advantage, 4 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> In a completely shocking twist, some winged elves are beginning to <i>actually enjoy</i> working with stone! It’s entirely unprecedented and a little alarming. Regardless, it seems some of your elves have been planning the creation of a mine in the back of their heads for quite some time.</p>

<p>In true flappy fashion, this will not be some cramped dwarven hellhole mine. The winged elves are planning to make it as livable as possible, with ventilation for fresh air and much wider tunnels than most mines. Indeed, the plans are to make the mines in such a way that exhausted portions of the mine can be used for storage, barracks, housing, industry, or any number of useful facilities. There are also plans for plenty of cliffside entrances and exits, allowing for both efficient entry and exit of miners and reduction of claustrophobia.</p>

<p>The <i>Copper Vein</i> Aspect is now a <i>Copper Mine</i>. The improved plans for mining winged elf style will provide an Upgrade on your first use of this Aspect, whether you invoke it or not.</p>

<p>Additionally, as it turns out, it was a good idea to take a break on the gardening project. This year's winter turns out to be much harsher than last year's. A thin blanket of snow carpets the canyon most of the season, and ice lines the river. Gardening probably would have failed.</p>

<p>Thankfully the stone homes that the winged elves constructed turn out to be quite good at keeping warm in winter, and you have plenty of feathers for insulation. You withstand the cold weather easily.</p>

<p><b>Dreamdust Trade</b></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the expected shipment of textiles and trade goods from the dreamdust elves does not arrive. After a few weeks of wondering if it’s late, you get a message (probably a dream message) from the dreamdust elves.</p>

<p>They were hit by Coyotes.</p>

<p>The shipment is gone.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Congratulations! Shadimon’s penetration testing was successful!</p>

<p>Oh, uh, penetration testing… isn’t actually supposed to succeed every time.</p>

<p>Oof.</p>

<p>Well, the good news is that Shadimon successfully got his point across!</p>

<p>You will have a boost die on your next cloak and dagger check. The ward is still active.</p>

    <p><b>Military:</b> Wow, okay, the burnies were <i>not kidding</i> about the Maar being dangerous! Thankfully, Varna’s unstoppable enthusiasm was a major asset in this endeavour. His drive to succeed combined with the excellent information and assistance provided by the fire elves turned this potentially dangerous expedition into quite the success!</p>

<p>The terrain around the Maar is indeed extremely dangerous. The fire elves give you a very comprehensive list of the different types of hazard and what to watch out for. Varna quickly works out a system for exploring. The biggest danger is when the scouts have to come down and rest, so the scouts do a quick pass of every area to determine safe resting points, then loop back around to do detailed observations and mapping. This system is a little slower than what they are used to, but is enough to ensure there are no severe injuries on your scouts.</p>

<p>In fact, not only do your scouts complete their assigned squares, they also stay in Surt a couple weeks longer than the original plan so that they can provide support for the Terror’s own scouting expedition. Between the two of them, the fire elves for once complete all of the  pathfinding they had hoped for!</p>

<p>The cold snap is a bit of an issue, but it's actually more of a problem when scouts keep transitioning from hot lava thermals to freezing cold winds. That is really not safe. Regardless, they are able to adapt to the circumstances and even use the cold winds to cool off when the oppressive heat of the Maar gets to be too much.</p>

<p>Oh, and here’s what you found for the fire elves-</p> 

<p>All of these squares have the Volcanic Badlands Aspect, but a few have something more interesting as well-</p>
<ul>
<li>The territory two squares south of Surt has a Sheltered Cove. Protected by a few large stable granite ridges, this area has slightly cleaner water and air, and is a bit more stable than most of the Maar.</li>

<li>The Territory that the fire elves encountered the lava bubble/firestorm in now has an Open Lava Pit. Most likely caused by the bubble, this kilometer long open scar is filled with free flowing magma. It appears to be contained, but one of your scouts swears up and down that they saw something moving along the surface of the lava a couple of times, leading to a <i>Lava Cryptid Rumor</i> Aspect. Fire elf geologist insist that it’s just harder boulders shaken up by the eruption floating to the top, but that scout swears she saw scales. On the upswing, the lava pit provided incredible thermals!</li>

<li>Your scouts reach and examine the mineral deposit identified by fire elf magic. Upon their return to Surt, Varna personally goes to deliver a report on their discovery to the Hunger. This report consists of Varna smugly clunking a gold nugget the size of a child's fist on the Hunger's desk. Oh, gods damn it all, it’s going to take <i>years</i> for Varna to lose the shit eating grin he got after doing that.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jump">Roleplay Event 2.3.1: <a href="../Bonus/7_A Surtian Flight.php">A Surtian Flight</a></h3>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> The researchers report that the Observatory gets cold as <i>balls</i> in the winter. Thankfully the underground archives stay warm at night, giving them a good place to pile. They make it through without any big problems as well. It might need to be addressed long term if you put a population center up there, though.</p>

<p>At any rate, starting with the practical was an excellent idea. It’s one thing to get everything organized, it’s another to actually find a way to use it. One thing’s for sure, when Dusk said “any place on the surface of the world to within a few miles, any time within a few thousand years within an hour”, she was <i>not fucking kidding</i>. The purely practical star charts that only list the exact positioning of the stars, planes, and moon as you would see them in the sky still contain an absolutely staggering amount of information. Bizarrely, they are not in any kind of chronological order. You are able to use the decoded category system to find what you need of course, but how exactly each set of charts was intended to relate to time or location is not clear from the organizational methods. There is clearly some cultural context you are missing. For some unknown reason, the Lycans were projecting the night sky from all kinds of places all over the world, sometimes hundreds or even thousands of years in the past or future.</p>

<p>Still, your researchers are able to power through these problems and narrow down the star charts to your general location and time period. Interestingly, the last few stacks of star charts transcribed were all done by the same hand. A couple of them bear a marking of Viss Hetia, the one whose note you found. It appears that in her last few years of life, she focused a very large amount of her attention on this region and time period. You are not sure why, but you are thankful.</p>

<p>You already have a few basic star charts for navigation, and absolutely have moon phase projections - those were life and death. The star charts you find are orders of magnitude more accurate and detailed. It’s frankly incredible how much more detail they are in, to the point that it’s readily apparent that the Lycans were concealing just how accurate they could make star charts. This may have been one of the reasons they were so hard to outmaneuver in the field.</p>

<p>Regardless, that advantage is now yours. You now have a large supply of star charts that should be relevant to your current time and location. Your scholars are easily able to replicate them for field use. This gives you the Civilization Aspect <i>Star Charts</i>. This Aspect can be invoked to improve any kind of Reconnaissance roll (first time’s free!,) as well as any roll where precise navigation is a major factor. On a character scale, your leaders and scouts now have access to star charts.</p>

<p>In addition, you find a few star charts that cover the area around the Watchtower in extreme detail. Any future Reconnaissance checks done within 5 squares of the Watchtower will be done with an Upgrade.</p>
