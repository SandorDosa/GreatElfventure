    <p><b>Economic:</b> Have we learned? Can we finally make some major progress on stonework? LET’S FIND OUT.</p>

<p>Using the Investment trapping of the Infrastructure skill to further develop the cliffs into functional working and living spaces. Rolling 2 ability: 2 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> We didn't make it this far by not being paranoid.</p>

<p>Cloak and Dagger trapping of Spycraft. Rolling 1 ability: 1 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Military: </b>“The Watchtower is a potential resource we’d be stupid to ignore. It’s such a landmark, according to the maps, and the descriptions make it sound damn near unclimbable. Investigate, explore, and see what there is to see.”</p>

<p>Pathfinder trapping of Reconnaissance to investigate and map Watchtower Rock. Rolling 2 ability and 1 proficiency: 0 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> We have a large-scale ward that needs a field test!</p>

<p>Magic trapping of Academics to cast the ward: detect intent to do harm to Asavardi or its people. Rolling 3 ability: 2 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Misc:</b> Early in the season, a group of winged elves flies in from the north- a few dozen, carrying crude rope baskets of supplies. They report that they had been hiding out in the forests of the central continent until recently. They made contact with the humans, and Lock gave them supplies and told them to go east until they hit elf. They are quite relieved to reach you, and report that more are coming.</p>

<p>You will now be receiving semi-regular groups of immigrants, allowing you to establish new settlements and grow old ones according to the rules.</p>

    <p><b>Economic:</b> FINALLY! After so much strife, toil, and hardship, Asavardi is starting to shape up. With lessons learned and renewed vigor, the cliffs finally start becoming what the flappies always wanted them to be. No longer narrow caves with cloth and curtains for cover, the winged elves are able to complete carving the caves into true homes with multi-room apartments and studios with actual furnishings and shutters for bad weather. It’s still modest compared to your old home, but it’s truly a place to be proud of now.</p>

<p>That, and the artistic carvings of the trees are complete, making Asavardi truly look like something the winged elves can call their own.</p>

<p>The <i>Cliffside Caves</i> Aspect has been improved to <i>Cliffside Homes</i>.</p>

<p>Newfound enthusiasm for Asavardi and the fact that you got it ready just in time for new residents, you will have a boost die if you use Infrastructure to add or improve an Aspect in Asavardi next turn.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> My legal team has advised me to use the phrase "you have found no spies."</p>

    <p><b>Military:</b> Your pathfinders approach the Watchtower carefully. Given the events of the past year, they’re not leaving things to chance. Dhakamari leads them slowly and meticulously. First, they scout around the base. They find a river coming out of a cave in the mountains to the east, leading to the larger river to the west.</p>

<p>The flight up to the top is difficult, even for someone with wings. They take their time, stopping to rest several times so they are at full strength when they reach the top.</p>

<p>The top of the tower is huge, well over two miles of open flat space. At first they see little more than scrub brush and dust, but close to the exact center of the tower they see a building.</p>

<p>It’s a moderately sized two story adobe building, perhaps as large as a good sized military barracks or an abbey. There’s a large domed structure on the roof, and the building appears to be surrounded by several large stone pillars radiating out from the building for several hundred yards. Several of them appear to have fallen over.</p>

<p>Dhakamari orders his pathfinders to move carefully. They take a survey of the area with a high altitude flight pass for getting close. High above, they all spot something that makes their blood run cold. On the ground in front of the building is a massive 50 foot wide holy symbol of Luna carved into the ground.</p>

<p>Dhakamari, however, is not dissuaded. A year ago, your pathfinders may have fled at the sight of it. Not this time. Dhakamari notes that there is dust and dirt slowly piling up on the symbol, and that the building and monoliths may be abandoned. He decides it’s worth a shot to take a look inside the building.</p>

<p>Indeed, the building appears abandoned. Inside, it appears to be some kind of monastery. Austere living conditions, simple eating areas, and the vast majority of the building devoted to long study rooms and empty racks of scroll cases. They move carefully and slowly, but there’s a layer of dust on everything.</p>

<p>On the second story of the building, they find a meager sleeping space, now empty. On the top floor, they find a device like something they have never seen before. It is a brass construction, with a large crystal in the base. Intricate gears and cogs litter the floor, along with strange runes carved into them. There are large spheres made of various stone and semi-precious metals scattered around, along with lenses and telescopes arrayed along the openings in the dome. Whatever it is, it appears to be broken. Dhakamari believes it to be some kind of device for skywatching. An observatory.</p>

<p id="jump">As they search the rest of the building, they find a basement entrance. Searching the basement, they find a small room nestled near the stairs. In that room, surrounded by some meager dried plants, they find the dessicated body of an elderly looking wereowl woman. Her wings are folded around her body, a mournful expression on her sunken face. She was wearing simple gray robes, and appears to have passed in her sleep. She appears to have passed away some time ago. In her hands she holds a note. It is written in the Lycan language, but anyone who knows that language can <a href="../Bonus/5_A Forgotten Testimony.php">read it.</a></p>

<p>Further in the basement, they find carved into the stone beneath the ruined building row after row of scrolls stored in stone racks. They are hundreds and hundreds of star charts, arrayed in staggeringly complicated methods that none of the pathfinders can even remotely crack. However they note that the hot dry air at this high altitude is apparently excellent for preserving things.</p>

<p>Having found no threat here, they compile a detailed report and return with a few samples of the star charts and the note from the deceased Lycan.</p>

<p>It is up to you what they did with her body.</p>

<p>The square has the following Aspects: Watchtower Rock,  River Source, and Ruined Observatory.</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> The Ward is brought up without a hitch! Shockingly! Your elves wait a few days for the other shoe to drop, but hey. Ward stays up. In utter disbelief that something actually went perfectly fine on the first try, a thorough examination of the wards is performed. A few physical gaps are found, tweaks are made, and all is well and good. Asavardi has an extra blanket of safety.</p>

<p>It will last 3 turns, expiring at the end of Spring.</p>

<p>Because of this thorough examination, if this casting of the ward is triggered you will receive a boost die on the resulting Cloak and Dagger check.</p>
