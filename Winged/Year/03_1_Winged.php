    <p><b>Economic:</b> Swear to gods if this garden thing doesn’t work again Tassimir is going to just have an aneurysm.</p>

<p>Investment trapping of Infrastructure, Rolling 2 ability: 2 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Ok so, boy that was a thing. The scouts and watchers are all kinda squinting at each other now, but boy are they motivated. If those Coyotes come back, we’re going to have more warning this time.</p>

<p>Cloak and Dagger trapping of Spycraft. Rolling 2 ability: 3 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Military: </b>“It’s an opportunity we can’t afford to miss,” Shrike said. “The blade elves are nothing to trifle with, and we’ve already worked out ways to adapt their training to our capabilities.”</p>

<p>Baijani hid a grin, “And so proud of that, you are.”</p>

<p>“As if you aren’t, ama. Not sending the Harriers; that’s all us. But you know as well as I do that people are angry about that attack.”</p>

<p>Baijani nodded. Since the Coyote attack, there had been a distinct shift in the tone around Asavardi. She had heard it in voices, overheard conversations, even body language. The people of Asavardi, even the most peace-loving, were incensed that someone had <i>dared</i> to attack them in the home they had worked and fought for. There would be no objections to Shrike’s plan. In fact they might have more volunteers than they had space for.</p>

<p>“Very well, consider this your project. Find the right people, get them organized, and take the wing to Alfyr. Make sure to send a messenger ahead so they know you’re coming.”</p>

<p>Drill trapping of Military Sciences, using blade elf skills, to recruit and start training a new unit. Rolling 3 ability and 1 proficiency: 1 advantage, 4 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> The ward is down, and we really want that back up. We haven’t had time to figure out how to combine the anti-wolf-elf glyph, but at this point that’s not really the priority.</p>

<p>Magic trapping of Academics to recast the ward: detect intent to do harm to Asavardi or its people. Rolling 4 ability: 2 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Tassimir is safe! Mercy of the Goddess, the gardens are finally ready!</p>

<p>Asavardi now, after all of this, has the Aspect Community Gardens. While at first this was something of a curiosity, now it’s starting to become something important. With yet another war starting just on their doorstep and violence having already reached their home, most winged elves are coming to accept the fact that they will never be truly free from conflict.</p>

<p>These gardens become an important part of Asavardi’s long term food plans. Families and sections of homes maintain their gardens together, not just for the vibrant greenery that makes stone seem more alive, but as a matter of survival. These community gardens are an important supplemental food source for Asavardi. In times when food is low, Asavardi can rely on these gardens for a temporary supply. It’s not enough to feed the village long term, but it is enough to keep people healthy during lean times.</p>

<p>These Community Gardens are set to be a permanent part of daily life. In addition to being invoked as normal, these gardens can be tapped once a year to provide a Boost Die on any skill check that involves feeding the people of Asavardi.</p>

    <p><b>Political:</b> Thankfully things stay pretty quiet. Asavardi mourns those who died in its defense, rebuilds what was lost, and comforts those who were hurt during the attack. The farming paths are reworked at the canyon rim so that an on foot attack from above can’t occur again. Asavardi can still be attacked, but a sudden direct assault on the heart of the town like that won’t be possible.</p>

<p>The watchers are still dealing with their failings and how to address them in the future. A few of them are talking about creating a formal organization of some kind, perhaps called Skywatchers, that could be used to create a higher standard of professionalism among them.</p>

<p>Regardless, you detect no incursions this turn.</p>

    <p><b>Military:</b> Shrike has a grand time meeting back up with her old instructors. It seems even the War Scholars forget to look up occasionally if they spend long enough away from her. <i>CONSTANT VIGILANCE</i> indeed, Master Jaakob!</p>

<p>Reunions aside, this is a major success for both the blade elves and the winged elves. After the sudden and terrifying violence that visited Asavardi just last season, there is no shortage of winged elves looking to find a way to defend their home. The need for soldiers has been demonstrated to everyone, and you have a large number of motivated volunteers.</p>

<p>As willing as they are to learn, the war scholars are eager to teach. Indeed, the war scholars are also willing to learn. They well know that their methods won’t work for winged elves, but they also know that their underlying philosophy will. They learn from not just Shrike and her experiences, but from Harrier volunteers, scouts, rangers, hunters, and even a few civilians who happen to be really good trick fliers.</p>

<p>Of note, the blade elves note that the compact recurve bows that the winged elves favor can be quite effective. During the war, the Myrkyr were a constant threat. Now that they are gone, it is more likely that they will face little resistance in the skies. Harriers are interceptors, trained to keep the skies clear. Now, particularly with the Coyotes obviously having great mobility and range but no fliers, a unit that could move and engage ground targets even at great range might be a way to keep nimble Coyote riders on their toes.</p>

<p>The war scholars dust off some old books about applying their unique disciplined approach to archery and adapt these methods to the winged elves. This unit might not be the toughest one ever, but it should be able to threaten ground targets with great effectiveness.</p>

<p>Note: Having spent one full turn Garrisoned at Asavardi, the Harriers have recovered from the casualties suffered in defense of the town and are back to full strength.</p>

    <p><b>Mental:</b> Whew! Now that no one’s dangling them off a cliff, your casters are easily able to get the ritual off. Knowing that there’s already a gap in coverage, they focus on making sure the ritual goes off with the highest reliability possible instead of trying to get fancy. This ends up being worthwhile, as this time they execute the ritual with textbook perfect precision.</p>

<p>The ward will be up for 4 turns, starting next turn. It will expire at the end of Summer, Year 4. Great!</p>

    <p><b>News Arrivals- Coyote Refugees:</b></p>
<p>Breaker arrives at Riverhaven, battered and weary. She bears numerous injuries, including several severe burns. She's not the only one. Her Cazadores are in rough shape, and they're down many of their numbers.</p>

<p>"We had to fight our way out," she explains, "The hijueputa knew. I don't know how, but he fucking knew I was going to betray him. The bastard turned the horse into a banquet 'in my honor' for 'valiantly defeating the trap and bringing back the loot.' The son of a bitch was using it as a setup to kill me and the ones most loyal to me. He had to have figured out I was going to backstab him and decided to do me in first."</p>

<p>"Well whatever he figured out, the bastard didn't know about the bomb. We set up the thing right in the middle of the training grounds inside the fort. He was planning on surrounding us and cutting us down when we got drunk. Almost did it."</p>

<p>"I had to set the fucking thing off myself. Only my people were expecting it. I got burned bad, and so did a lot of my people, but it fucking worked. Coyote's people didn't know how to react. We had to fight our way out of the fort with hell at our backs, but we fucking did it. They were so distracted by the bomb we even broke open the stables and stole as many horses as we could."</p>

<p>"The whole fort looked like a torch going up. It was loud as hell, too. Lit up half the town like it was daylight. I don't know what that thing was packed with, but without that we never would have made it. The guards were distracted enough that we were able to get our families out safe. We had to charge the gates to make an exit, but we made it. We ran, and we could see the damned thing burning all the way to the horizon. It must have kept Coyote busy, because no one came after us."</p>

<p>"We're torn up pretty bad. We wouldn't have made it much further, civilians or no. We've been through worse, but not by a lot. I'll stand by my agreement that the Cazadores will stay out of Riverhaven, but they could sure use a chance to recover…"</p>

<p>Breaker has arrived at Riverhaven with 2 units of Cazadores. Unfortunately they took losses fleeing Coldwater. One unit has Light Casualties, one has Heavy Casualties. Both have Low Morale, though that will likely recover on its own so long as their families are safe.</p>

<p>Speaking of, Riverhaven now has the Coyote Refugees Aspect. They fill in the Extra Housing, making that Aspect unusable for the duration of their stay. Thankfully, Coyotes are resilient and resourceful people. They brought a great deal of their own supplies and apply their skills to supporting their presence in Riverhaven, meaning their presence does not inflict any kind of Stress. The dreamdust elves ask them to dress in dreamdust clothing, making it less immediately apparent that Riverhaven took in the refugees. Successful Spying will still find them.</p>

<p>In addition, they brought a Coyote Horses Aspect with them. These are their youngest horses that were being bred for Cavalry. They are light war horses with the Racer archetype. Invoking them to create a Cavalry unit will provide an extra proficiency die. This Aspect can be given to any faction, though it is currently up to the dreamdust elves who gets it.</p>

<p>In return for the economic losses the fire elves suffered, Breaker reports that the bomb caused the Crippled Barracks consequence on the Fort. The garrison at Coldwater is unusable next season, and his forces will not be able to recover from their own casualties or recruit any new units.</p>
