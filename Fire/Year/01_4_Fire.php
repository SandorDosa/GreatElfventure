<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves ain&rsquo;t got no problems except a desperate need for therapy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Investment): Kremastos [the Hunger]</p>
<p><em>Includes Upgrade from Economic Action (Fall/Winter Year 1)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Difficulty decreased from Economic Action (Winter Year 1)</em></p>
<p>Even more determined than ever to change Surt into a prosperous, self-sufficient settlement that can at least feed itself, the Hunger doubles down. Clearing the poisonous impurities from the agricultural ash should mean that the composting process is more viable; in addition, a thicker soil layer, supported by small stone markers (to help keep it stable) and solid waterproofing underneath might increase the viability of some of the deeper-rooted and taproot crops. Its also worth investigating whether the alchemical impurities from the ash can be used for pest control in the surrounding area -- as its almost certain that once the crops become viable, pests will become a problem.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Hunger approves plans to divert some of the Aqua Via&rsquo;s flow to help cool the nearby caves -- not as a large-scale additional project, but more as a way to make sure the Surtians are not forced to live solely on fruits and vegetables. Further considerations, such as using livestock to help provide more compost, using the waterflow to the caves to produce livestock feed, and even growing mushrooms within the cave system, are also taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Finally, one additional design change that could make these more viable is to spread the vine-oriented crops onto the edges of the growing spaces -- this way, they can be encouraged to grow onto and dangle from the masonry, rather than interfering with the growing space of other crops. If this at least means the vine crops become viable, this will be a strong step in the right direction (and look nice too).</p>

<p><strong>Economic Action 2 (motivating with 1 FP)</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade (Merchants): Into the Woods [Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p><em>Cooperation with River Elves</em></p>
<p>The Phoenix Imperialis is nothing if not opportunistic, and as fortune would have it, their opportunity has finally arrived -- the upcoming shipment of wood from the River Elf Flotillas, recently sighted on approach up the Burning Wolf river. Finally finished with biding their time, the Imperials dispatch Phoenix Lord Barrabus Leafstorm to make the exchange. He is to offer a large supply of the city&rsquo;s construction-quality ash, along with a few recipes (surreptitiously acquired from the Hunger&rsquo;s records) for high-stability and fast-setting mixes (and of course not the absolute top stuff -- got to save something to sell later) gratis, in the spirit of free enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their real motivations are twofold: gain control of the wood, and thus gain some measure of control over the expansion and heating plans the wood is destined for.</p>

<p>River Elf <em>Cooperation</em> results: 2 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Wolf at the Door [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p><em>Includes a bonus die for the Praesidum [let me know if this doesn&rsquo;t count]</em></p>
<p>The Terror&rsquo;s recent military activity may have put a damper on the Ashwalker&rsquo;s direct influence, but the Ashen are still loyal to her, and the Praesidium still eager. <em>And</em> some Civile patrols reported hearing strange noises and howls over several nights towards the end of last season. If the Triumvirate insists on increasing the city&rsquo;s military at the expense of its Praesidium patrols, Tsun can at least put what resources and rhetoric she has towards finding and removing the Lycan infiltrators now stalking its streets. And&hellip; at the Terror&rsquo;s &lsquo;insistence&rsquo;, in a private meeting shortly before the Spring Solstice, finding and capturing any other strange visitors too.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=c185b930db213300e7a0a08a48961933">Roll</a>: 2 Advantage, 1 Success<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Reconnaissance (Pathfinders): Wagons West [the Terror]</p>
<p>Despite the Hunger&rsquo;s hard efforts, the Terror concludes that additional agricultural support for Surt may be necessary before further expansion can be considered. Fortunately, there are at least a few spots to the southwest of the settlement that could support a port, and possibly some forestry and farmland as well. And woodfire bathing is very popular right now. As such, the Terror personally accompanies the hopefully-now-somewhat-recovered Pathfinder teams on a survey of [the square directly to the south of Surt, the square directly to Surt&rsquo;s south-west, and the square west of that]. Finding useable land is the most important part, but the Terror personally wants to survey the land for its fortification potential and strongest place for a port.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=7fd53d34db213300e7a0a08a48961977">Roll</a>: 2 advantage</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Creation): Capitalized City Planning [Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p>In order to synergize profit margins with Surt&rsquo;s core competencies, the heads of the Phoenix Imperialis commission the academics of Surt (with the Phoenix Lord at the head, to persuade them) to deep dive into potential bleeding edge growth hacks that will allow Surt&rsquo;s business leaders to expand operations -- or, as Barrabus actually puts it, &ldquo;find out what we need to do to expand local infrastructure on a budget&rdquo;. From the Imperials&rsquo; own assumptions, that budget will likely mostly consist of wood. [This is effectively a test to improve the next Infrastructure (Establishment) test].</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=54167174db213300e7a0a08a48961928">Roll</a>: 1 advantage, 3 successes</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action:</strong></p>
<p>Hunger uses RESEARCH to try to find a way to regain his mind while in a wolflike state.</p>
<p>Rolls: Know (Arcane) 21, Craft (Alchemy) 23</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Lair:</strong></p>
<p>To isolate the wolf, the Hunger has changed one of the supply closets of his lab into a secure saferoom, with a paw-unfriendly lockable doorknob on the inside, backed up by a puzzle bar (i.e. a bar built into an intricate frame, making it both hard to knock loose, and &lsquo;coincidentally&rsquo; hard for a wolf to pull out) and a series of chains; an intricate inbuilt pulley ensures that the puzzle bar pulls shut automatically on close, and a chain rack is set up to make pulling the chains closed swift as well. The closet itself is a 20&rsquo;x10&rsquo;x10&rsquo; space, surrounded by stone, and ventilated by a few 3&rdquo; narrow carved vents at the top, the vents padded with thin cloth at their exit into the main lab. The floor and walls of the closet are covered in a few thick carpets, and are themselves 7&rsquo; thick, consisting of a layer of 2&rsquo; cubic stone blocks, a thin sheet of lead, 3&rsquo; of dirt, and another layer of 2&rsquo; cubic stone blocks. The chamber is built underneath the building&rsquo;s siege cistern, as a deliberate attempt to prevent potential fire damage from getting out of control -- but also as a result subduing any noises coming from inside the chamber. Finally, the chamber is outfitted with a number of heavy chains and lead balls, originally purchased for Surt&rsquo;s prison system, and taken as surplus by the Hunger. Finally, the chamber contains a number of ox bones, set aside by the Hunger mostly to see if the dog will sit still and chew on them.</p>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<p><strong>Results-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic- Merchants- </strong>Barrabus Leafstorm ends up just as much trying to cool an argument as much as trade for some godsdamned wood. Who cares about some stupid tourist, there&rsquo;s work to be done!</p>
<p><br />Thankfully, Barrabus is good at his job. The trade goes down smoothly, even if some of the leaders are snapping at each other a bit. No one gets lit on fire, so hey! Progress!</p>
<p>You trade your ash for the <em>lumber shipment</em> aspect, to use as you so desire.</p>
<p>In addition, the people who actually do the trading got along great and you&rsquo;ll get a boost die on your next check to trade with the river elves.</p>
<p>Wait, where&rsquo;d Barrabus go?</p>
<p><em>Godsdammit</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure- </strong>You have successfully created the rooftop gardens! It seems with that little bit of toxicity out of the mix and a little fresh soil scattered in to get things kicked off, the rooftop gardens are finally getting off the ground. They&rsquo;re nothing incredible right now and aren&rsquo;t enough to feed the city alone, but as Surt gains more sources of plants and food the operation should be scalable. In addition, the ashy soil actually seems fantastic for growing grapes with surprisingly strong and complex flavors. Wine should be interesting!</p>
<p>The diversion of the Aqua Via to cool caves works as well, but it&rsquo;s more of a proof of concept for the moment. The Hunger is also correct. The nice side effect to this horrifically toxic place you&rsquo;ve decided to settle for some reason is that there is no shortage of raw material for alchemical pesticides. Nice!</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>The Praesidium take to the streets to protect Surt during a pivotal trading event. They are a far cry from the disorganized mob they once were. They work in organized patrols, with set routes and reporting structures that are actually under someone&rsquo;s control this time. They report five suspicious lurkers, three potential werewolf sightings, and one possible devil incursion. None of these turn out to be anything important.</p>
<p>Okay, not <em>huge </em>progress, but progress nonetheless. They don&rsquo;t wreck anybody&rsquo;s houses this time.</p>
<p><strong>Military- </strong>The Terror&rsquo;s proposed route takes her expedition through some of the harshest terrain the volcanically unstable area around the maar has to offer. They begin south, sweeping through the territory in the sector furthest from the maar itself.</p>
<p>The square directly south of Surt has the aspects <em>Maar Shore, Volcanic Soil, </em>&nbsp;and interestingly, <em>Petrified forest.</em></p>
<p>The fire elves had hung close to the shores of the maar on the way in, and had apparently missed a stunning petrified forest just a few miles to the east. No one&rsquo;s sure what can be done with these stone trees quite yet, but they&rsquo;re strikingly beautiful. What the Terror finds there, however, is significantly less pleasant.</p>
<p>Hidden in a narrow ravine among the stone trees are the tattered remains of a few yurts, as well as the tattered remains of their occupants. At least fifteen bodies, almost all human. They are in significantly more than fifteen pieces. They wear rusted armor that the Terror recognizes as belonging to an auxiliary that stayed loyal, though their insignia have been ripped off. Whatever fought them appears to have torn through them in what must have been a major fight. Their bodies have been cut to pieces, literally, with limbs and torsos torn asunder with little help from armor.</p>
<p>The heads have been severed and stacked in a pile in the middle of camp. Each head is branded with a symbol burned into their skin. The Terror recognizes it as a magic brand, as well as the brand being Skaplyndi runes. The runes themselves are difficult to translate, as the runic form of the language is different than the normal form.</p>
<p>(If a translator speaks Lycan, it&rsquo;s a DC 15 Linguistics to translate. If not, it&rsquo;s DC 25)</p>
<p>The rune is actually two separate runes layered on top of eachother.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One rune is &ldquo;hefja bl&oacute;t,&rdquo; a rune meaning essentially &ldquo;to sacrifice a heathen in worship of Luna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other rune is &ldquo;ey&eth;ask,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;come to naught, wasted, purged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bodies are also nearly mummified, though the Terror cannot tell if this is due to time or the maar&rsquo;s harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The Terror decides that this is reason enough to call off the expedition and return to Surt to ensure its safety. The other planned squares are not pathfound this turn.</p>
<p><strong>Academics- </strong>Well <em>something</em> succeeded, but Barrabus is not sure exactly what. The Phoenix Imperialis certainly make a good impression with the civil planning council. Enough buzzwords and jargon get thrown around that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to tell if something is actually being discussed or if everyone is trying to convince everyone else that they know what they&rsquo;re talking about. At the end of the season, though, someone slaps down a heavy stack of scrolls on Barrabus&rsquo; lap that contain detailed financial planning and budgeting. Hooray?</p>
<p>This expanded budget is a bit vague as you weren't planning on anything specific, but regardless it will give you an upgrade on your next Infrastructure (establishment) check.</p>
<p>Barrabus seems to have gotten a bit sick of local politics. He advises his staff that he is taking an &ldquo;extended trade relations networking seminar&rdquo; with the river elves and promptly hops off onto the flotilla without asking anyone. Barrabus is unavailable for the next turn.</p>
<p><strong>The Hunger&rsquo;s Dark Secret</strong></p>
<p>The Hunger&rsquo;s extensive preparations of the &ldquo;kennel&rdquo; as he is coming to call it himself prove well worth the effort. The dog stays contained for all transformations this turn. It does appear to be trying to get out during the night, but it is unable to free itself from the cell, significantly damage the walls, or figure out the locking mechanism - though alarmingly every time he wakes up the puzzle locks are in a different configuration. The ox bones are chewed nearly to dust every morning.</p>
<p>Also a benefit, the Hunger manages to stifle any further rumors of his affliction. Most of the old rumors are wild conspiracy theories now. There were some rumors of howling from his first transformation, but with the frequent false alarm wolf sightings quite ironically provided by the Praesidium these howls get ignored by most. Additionally, nothing that the hunger acquired was overly suspicious for an already paranoid alchemist.</p>
<p>These measures may not hold out forever, but for now he is safe.</p>
<p>As far as his research goes, the hunger has quite a few resources at his fingertips. Between his old mentor&rsquo;s notes and the quite extensive supply of battlefield reports and gathered information on managing the affliction from the rebellion, he has an extensive amount of resources to draw from.</p>
<p>In researching how he possibly could have turned so long after the bite, the Hunger comes to a conclusion: As much as it acts like a disease, the affliction is a <em>curse</em>, notably it is a curse created by the mind of one of the most deceptive and cruel deities of any pantheon. If the affliction follows any rules at all, it is deliberately created to evade anyone&rsquo;s attempts to control it. Bellaphex created the affliction to be a permanent corruption of the Lycans, and for it to never be eradicated. Mortals can only manage it, never truly predict or contain it.</p>
<p>Being that it is a curse and not a disease, the Hunger knows that what happened to him falls outside of the normal rules of the affliction - but the affliction does not always follow normal rules. In his notes he finds many recorded instances of a person becoming afflicted some time after their encounter with a lycanthrope, even if the offending creature is long dead.</p>
<p>A blade elf who cut his hand on his bloodied sword two days after a battle. A human cavalryman who mounted a werewolf&rsquo;s head on his saddle, only for a tooth to cut his leg weeks later and afflict him. Of particular note, your mentor noted an incident where an alchemist was afflicted during a lab accident in which she was hit with shattering glass from a vial of preserved werewolverine blood during an explosion. Exposure to blood, teeth, or bodily fluids of a lycanthrope does not normally cause an affliction, but these cases prove that it can happen.</p>
<p>After acquiring more wolfsbane and repeating his experiment to confirm that the substance turns black when exposed to his blood, the Hunger comes to the conclusion that at the time when he performed his check he was indeed not afflicted. He&rsquo;s not sure how, but there was a secondary exposure. The most likely suspect would be a bit of blood, saliva, or chipped tooth from the tourist that was sealed in his would by the onsite healing magic and only later became exposed to his bloodstream. It would be an absolutely astronomical stroke of bad luck, but it&rsquo;s quite possible.</p>
<p>As far as researching how to control himself during the transformation, well, the bad news is that it&rsquo;s fundamentally impossible for an afflicted werewolf to completely control themselves during a change. It&rsquo;s a fundamental aspect of the curse that it erodes the will of its subject. Even the strongest willed afflicted with years of practice in controlling themselves can only manage the barest modicum of control, however a bare modicum of control <em>is</em> possible. There are many accounts of afflicted werewolves being able to force themselves to avoid killing people they care about, or flee their homes to negate the risk of killing someone they love. If such a thing is possible with willpower alone, willpower and alchemy should be able to help.</p>
<p>This will be a major, perhaps years long undertaking. The Hunger literally pitting his wits against the twisted mind of a deity of suffering and corruption. There will be many pitfalls.</p>
<p>For now, he has an idea. He decides to approach the problem in a twofold fashion: By strengthening his mind, and weakening the dog&rsquo;s. He is able to place a brazier in the ventilation system of the kennel. By burning a combination of scentblock and calming herbs, he is able to keep the dog somewhat pacified or at least unable to alert on some poor passing janitor.</p>
<p>He discovers in his supplies preserved seeds for a rare herb called <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipmenT/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances/#TOC-Nepenthe">Nepenthe</a>. The pollen of this rare flower enhance stable and calm thoughts in humanoids, and suppresses violent and malevolent ones. The pollen is only useful when directly inhaled, but if the Hunger figures out a way to apply it to the dog he might be able to gain control for a few brief moments. For now, the Hunger learns that if he mixes some of the pollen with the incense he burns for the dog he gains a +5 on the DC 20 will save to remember what happened during a change.</p>
<p>He is able to successfully plant some of these flowers in his new rooftop garden, along with many alchemically useful plants and herbs.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home&rdquo; is only a word. For the fire elves, it&rsquo;s a word that dredges up unpleasant memories and pain. The only home they ever had burned around them, killed most of who they knew, and twisted their minds and bodies into these new forms that make them still strangers to themselves. That, however, is beginning to the change. For the first time, the fire elves have a place that is constructed by and for the fire elves - not borrowed from Lycans or blade elves, not a temporary camp, a real permanent city. They are beginning to create their own identity, their own path, and for the first time in a long time, they dare to use the word &ldquo;home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are refugees no more.</p>
<p>For completing your first turn and forging a new home for the fire elves, you are rewarded with one skill point to distribute wherever you would like. In addition, you receive one refresh point which may at this time be exchanged for a stunt of your choosing.</p>
