<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves have constant problems with poor-quality fanfic between their leaders and Lycans</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade (Merchants): Quills to Plowshares [the Hunger and the Smoke]</p>
<p>Eager to enact their tentative three-way trade agreement with the Dreamdust and Flying Elves, the Hunger organizes the CPC&rsquo;s experts on agriculture and aquaculture on a new project -- assisting the Dreamdust elves in developing serious farmland of their own. Initial research relies heavily on the limited information already available about Dreamdust territory, combined with the Smoke&rsquo;s expertise in adapting untamed agriculture (also known as foraging). The goal here is to provide a work base, so that the researchers aren&rsquo;t going in blind.</p>
<p>After two weeks of intense preparation, the Smoke is assigned to escort a select team (made up both of researchers and experienced farmers), starter seeds, and fertilizer to Dreamdust territory via riverboat, and from there to assist them in agricultural research and development for the remainder of the season. Additional preparations can be made if it is determined that the Dreamdust elves require more than a season&rsquo;s worth of assistance.</p>
<p>The Hunger also arranges some accommodations for their incoming flying guests, in the hopes that their first visit to Surt will be a productive and trade-enticing one.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=fa1ef807db123300e7a0a08a48961916">Roll</a>: 2 successes</p>
<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): A New Approach [the Hunger and Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>Problem one: allied reports suggest the presence of another faction, actively using magic and poisons to facilitate espionage activities within allied zones.</p>
<p>Problem two: Ashwalker Tsun insists on being politically relevant</p>
<p>Solution: Make Ashwalker Tsun pay for relevance, by using her minions to monitor for *actual* spy activity.</p>
<p>The Hunger decides that Tsun&rsquo;s rather inefficient crusade could and should be turned to something more useful, and the Civile Praesidium&rsquo;s rough rise from vigilante groups to more serious security force could be of benefit to the security of Surt as a whole. So he decides to channel that.</p>
<p>He &ldquo;drafts&rdquo; Tsun and her forces for a special training program, with the idea that rather than &ldquo;watching their fellow citizens like an armed band of nosey neighbors&rdquo;, the Praesidium should be trained to recognize actual potential threats. He has the more academically minded trained in the use of wands and scrolls (and spells in general) of <em>detect magic</em>, useful for scanning for the suspiciously enchanted, as well as spellcraft to help identify what&rsquo;s actually suspicious. He has the Constabulary Guard (the *actual* city guard) train some units in actual investigation, in counter-counterfeiting, and in threat diffusion. Finally, he organizes them into training groups, and runs them through practice scenarios and drills, as well as posting them at secure sites alongside experienced Constabulary units.</p>
<p>While this is mostly an attempt to train them into something useful, Tsun drives her followers towards success, in the hopes that if they manage to prove themselves here, the Hunger will want to make use of them more often.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=729d8907db123300e7a0a08a489619e7">Roll</a>: Literally nothing (well that didn&rsquo;t go anywhere)</p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Drill): Expansionary Force [the Terror]</p>
<p>If the Fire Elves are to expand, they must be able to defend the territories they expand into. And with unusual sightings on the edge of Surtian territory, and reports of &ldquo;Wolf Elf&rdquo; infiltrators in Dark Elf territory, the Terror determines that any new attempt at Fire Elf settlement must be supported by an expansionary force. She orders the creation of a new division -- the Expansionary Guard, whose job will be to move to and help defend Surt&rsquo;s next outpost or thorp. She doesn&rsquo;t specify &ldquo;when&rdquo; that will occur, beyond sometime within the next year, but there are some hints that a successful term in the Expeditionary Guard may mean a permanent position, and some land, in whatever colony should be produced. The first segment will be milites -- not the most powerful, but sturdy and defensible.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=67f54183db123300e7a0a08a48961984">Roll</a>: 2 advantage, 3 successes</p>
<p><strong>Military Action 2 (motivating with 1 FP):</strong></p>
<p>Reconnaissance (Pathfinders): Gates of Fire [the Terror]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf sightings&rdquo; cannot be allowed to bottle in the Fire Elves forever, and the Terror is more certain than ever that Surt needs a proper water port in order to be able to maintain trade and connections with their allies. To that end, she arms up and leads another expedition -- this one to only cover [the two squares immediately to the south of Surt]. Together with the scouting provided by the Flying Elves, this should give the Triumvirate plenty of options as to where to put a freshwater port.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=f6a0594bdb123300e7a0a08a4896191b">Roll</a>: 1 advantage</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): Deep Scan [the Fury]</p>
<p>The Smoke&rsquo;s concerns about Surt&rsquo;s volcanic activity has merit, but thusfar no one has managed to locate a safe and accessible path into the areas below Surt, nor really any evidence of possible lava paths. Thus, the Fury proposes the creation of a new ritual -- a sort of &ldquo;deep scan&rdquo; that will allow at least some exploration of Surt&rsquo;s foundation via clairvoyance, scrying, and limited summon-scouting. With some luck, this ritual might also be applied to other areas, allowing for limited scouting without requiring transportation or exposure [i.e. a ritual to scout a square, or a ritual to provide bonuses to scouting some squares].</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=6ef98d07db123300e7a0a08a48961994">Roll</a>: 2 advantage, 2 successes</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Actions and questions:</strong></p>
<p>Subject is belligerent, linguistically capable, and has access to at least a limited subset of available memories. Subject has shown capacity to infer thoughts and behavior in others, though not necessarily the capacity to infer differences in motivation. Subject is not necessarily aware of the purpose of all actions, however; else it likely would interfere with the candle test. Subject shows abject interest in continuing the conversation, particularly in terms of evoking an emotional response.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s fuck with it, shall we?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going cold turkey might force it to try harder to escape, so that should be avoided. Instead, it's better to provide it unexpected stimuli, and monitor its responses.</p>
<p>Hunger Question 1: Brighteye</p>
<p>Hunger Question 2: Governor</p>
<p>Hunger Question 3: Leafstorm</p>
<p>Hunger Question 4: Wine?</p>
<p><strong>Action 1:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even an exceptional disguise kit cannot be relied on 100%, and magical disguises tend to be reliant on rather obvious magic. Maybe there is an alchemical concoction that can be produced that will help hide the physical symptoms still visible in normal daylight?</p>
<p>Craft (Alchemy): 34</p>
<p><strong>Action 2</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hunger <strong>does</strong> have something to compare the dog's thaumatic form to -- his own, outside of the curse's effect. If he can identify the differences between the two, he might be able to suppress the curse through magical means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few comparative samples for more normal individuals could also be good (a pity any he did have of himself without the curse would have burned up in the Conflagration); the Hunger briefly considers having the Constabulary Guard introduce thaumatic fingerprinting just as an excuse to create a library of anonymized samples for comparison, but decides to hold off on that potentially expensive proposition for now. Instead, the Hunger uses a little bit of discretionary income and his recent disguise experience, and sets up an &ldquo;Arcanic Portraiture&rdquo; stand in the marketplace for a couple of days, offering &ldquo;aura printouts&rdquo; to discerning customers for a few scant copper pieces. He&rsquo;s not even bothering to keep a copy of the printouts; instead, he takes some brief notes (no personal information attached) on general information as he goes, until he has enough basic &ldquo;sample data&rdquo; to project what your average Fire Elf&rsquo;s aura looks like. After around 100 useable samples (controlling for population bias as much as possible), he closes shop and returns to his lab.</p>
<p>With a baseline, his own data, and the dog&rsquo;s data all now available, the Hunger pulls out his scrolls on thaumatic metaphysics and starts digging.</p>
<p>Knowledge (Arcana): 21</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Fury Actions:</strong></p>
<p>Action 1:&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a good bit of soul searching and several months to calm down, the Fury decides she&rsquo;s finally &lsquo;comfortable&rsquo; enough to try and examine exactly what the shit went down in Muspelham -- or at least what went down in that ritual (she also wants to know how Ink breached the Nameless One ritual without causing the catastrophic brain-melting resonance cascade the Hunger warned about when they first enacted this thing, but that sounds more like a question for Ink than something to experiment with).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to start with&hellip; there are those rituals. She never did get a good look at the setup, even from the other side, but thanks to her recent experiences in ritual management (notably including how not to set one up), she thinks she might have a better idea of what both rituals (the phoenix&rsquo;s original suggestion *and* Governor Creepyhands&rsquo; (note to self -- ask Barry for tips on what to call the Governor scratch that, DO NOT LET BARRY FIGURE IT OUT) version of it) would actually do. So time to do some research!</p>
<p>First ritual: Spellcraft -- 31</p>
<p>Second ritual: Spellcraft -- 12</p>
<p><strong>Terror actions:</strong></p>
<p>Looming in the lunch line. Looming for the official fire-cast portraiture. Looming over the training yards. Looming in the hallway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Terror decides she needs to <em>do</em> something before she goes <em>looming crazy</em>.</p>
<p>First off, this whole 'constantly failing to pathfind a few miles of land' thing is getting looming ridiculous. And there's still no sign of those wolf riders.</p>
<p>...And maybe that's because they're looking in the wrong spot. After all, the best way to observe an enemy position is to stand over it.</p>
<p>She gathers some supplies -- enough for two weeks, though she plans to be gone for less than one. Then, one morning, she walks out the gates of Surt, picks the biggest of the mountains overlooking Surt to the north, and starts climbing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe there's something there. Maybe it's a Lycan scout. Maybe it's a dragon. Maybe it's Crag Elves. Only one way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<h3>Winter Year 2 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>The expedition to assist the dreamdust elves is a success. Indeed, the dreamdust elves were actually in a pretty good situation when you arrived. The land they settled in is somewhat arid, yes, but orders of magnitude less inhospitable than the terrain around Surt. Most importantly, the Coldwater river that Riverhaven is located on is an excellent source of fresh clean mountain runoff, and flowing at a very solid pace. While it's no fertile river valley, it is absolutely a surmountable problem.</p>
<p>Better yet, the dreamdust elves called you over <em>before</em> they had an actual problem. In fact, Vita reports that they are quite pleasant to work with. Their foraging methods are currently working well enough to feed their population and even keep a small surplus. They seem to be more concerned for the future than worried about any current problems. In fact, they have already constructed extra housing and seem to be actively planning for Riverhaven to grow. Not only that, but they have assembled a team of growers and potential farmers before you even got there who are ready and willing to work with you. This is a large boon for the team, as it means the dreamdust elves are already ahead of the game and cooperation comes naturally.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of farming in a region like this is always water, and in this the Coldwater is a massive advantage. The cool mountain runoff should continue in all but the most severe droughts, and the river does reliably swell in the spring. Most of the plan the Smoke and her team come up with involves collecting, storing, and utilizing the abundant waters of the river. This should be able to provide for plenty of farmland, and a good degree of drought resistance. In addition, many of the Hunger's alchemical fertilization and water purification designs are delivered. The Smoke's team believes that these may be used for cultivating some of the more, ah, <em>exotic </em>crops that the dreamdust elves prefer.</p>
<p>Oh, and you give them plans for using a variant of the aqua via to provide fresh clean drinking water and cool homes in Riverhaven.</p>
<p>You have successfully given the Dreamdust elves the <em>Agricultural Plan</em> temporary aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Ashwalker Auburn Tsun is an absolutely infuriating contrarian demagogue. She's happy to go chasing random wolf howls, but when an <em>actual credible threat</em> presents itself she digs in her heels. Tsun is immediately suspicious that this whole "wolf elf" thing is a lie invented by the Triumvirate in order to subvert more of her control of the Praesidium. Worse, she is openly vocal about the fact that she doesn't believe they actually exist. Given the Terror's earlier attempts to aggressively recruit Praesidium members under her control and her current ongoing military recruitment drive, Tsun's suspicions are perhaps not completely baseless.</p>
<p>The Hunger is eventually able to sway her to his side by massaging her ego a bit and promising the benefits of training up the Praesidium, but her skepticism remains and slows the whole operation. While the Praesidium and Tsun are eager to learn new skills and improve their prestige, cooperation is a bit abrasive most of the time. The improved training does stick, but it diverts most of the Praesidium's attention and much of the guards'.</p>
<p>Worse, an apparent breach happens on the night of one of the Hunger's "episodes." A cloaked shape is seen snooping around inside a water filter production site, but the Praesidium patrol that spots it does not have authority to enter such a sensitive area. Praesidium messengers rush to get permission from the Hunger to enter the restricted area and pursue the spy, but the Hunger is nowhere to be found until the next day. Tsun blames Hunger for the spy's escape, and frames it as a foolish bureaucrat slowing the progress of the determined everyman Praesidium. This drives hardcore Tsun supporters even further from the Triumvirate.</p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> <strong>Recruitment- </strong>Finally something that plays to the Terror's strengths! She funnels her recent frustrations into a recruiting drive, putting her significant will and presence behind the campaign. Indeed, with everything that's happening many of the populace agree that defense is a major concern. The Triumvirate's current popularity with the new immigrants proves an immediate boon, as well.</p>
<p>Overall, a large number of new immigrants happily and readily join this new Milites unit. Most of them were not previously soldiers by trade, but the Terror's commanding presence drives them through training with surprising Esprit de Corps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the Terror's forceful personality, the recruitment of the Expansionary Guard is a rousing success and there are still plenty of volunteers left over. If you make a Drill check to recruit soldiers next turn, you will have a boost die.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinders- </strong>Holy <em>shit</em>, winged elf scouts are good!</p>
<p>As some consolation, they initially have great difficulty in exploring the Maar. Taking to the wing helps them immensely, but even they have to stop to rest, which can be extremely dangerous. The excellent information your pathfinders give them and Varna's unbreakable enthusiasm mesh together to create a solid plan for the winged elves to explore the treacherous terrain.</p>
<p>Not only do they finish the explorations you gave them, they volunteer to stay a couple extra weeks so that they can help the Terror with her pathfinding expedition. This is great because they were starting to get bogged down <em>again.</em> This year's winter is harsher than last year, and a major cold front starts moving through. The mixture of cold weather and hot terrain prove taxing on the scouts. The extra air support provided by the winged elves allows the pathfinders to move more quickly and finish their assigned route, saving their strength and improving economy of movement. The Terror's group still does most of the heavy lifting on this leg, but a winged elf or two assisting the team allows them to move much more safely.</p>
<p>All of these squares have the <em>Volcanic Badlands</em> Aspect, but a few have something more interesting as well-</p>
<ul>
<li>The territory two squares south of Surt has a <em>Sheltered Cove</em>. Protected by a few large stable granite ridges, this area has slightly cleaner water and air, and is a bit more stable than most of the Maar.</li>
<li>The Territory that Smoke encountered the lava bubble in now has an <em>Open Lava Pit.</em> Most likely caused by the bubble, this kilometer long open scar is filled with free flowing magma. It appears to be contained, but the winged elves report that they may have seen something moving along the surface of the lava a couple of times, leading to a <em>Lava Cryptid Rumor</em> Aspect. It could just be harder boulders shaken up by the eruption floating to the top, but one scout <em>swears </em>they saw scales.</li>
<li>The winged elves reach and examine the mineral deposit. Upon their return, Varna personally goes to deliver a report on their discovery to the Hunger. This report consists of Varna smugly clunking a gold nugget the size of a child's fist on the Hunger's desk. Varna has a supremely smug grin the whole time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jump">Roleplay Event 2.3.1: <a href="../Bonus/9_A Surtian Flight.php">A Surtian Flight</a></h3>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>Congratulations! You have successfully created the ritual <em>Deep Scan!</em> It has the following stats-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk </strong>- Low</li>
<li><strong>Range </strong>- One Territory</li>
<li><strong>Target </strong>- One territory that has already been pathfound.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty </strong>- 2</li>
<li><strong>Effect </strong>- This ritual provides a detailed look at the geology under a territory that has already been explored. It reveals any Aspects relating to subsurface features that may have been missed by surface pathfinders, such as hidden caves, volcanic activity, deep mineral deposits, and seismic faults. In addition, the detailed geological information it provides gives an automatic Upgrade to the next use of any Aspects in that territory related to underground features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fury has learned a lot from her previous mistakes, and is starting to get the hang of this whole "rituals" thing. Her experiences surrounding her trip to the Akashic plane and her little pep talk with Ink have given her a lot of perspective into her own flaws, and what she can do to counteract them. Her experience narrowly avoiding a disaster caused by the unstable ley lines only improved her confidence. She is beginning to learn how to approach her great arcane potential carefully.</p>
<p>One piece of advice from Ink that stuck with her was "you are not alone, nor should you be." She is well aware of her flaws and while she is working on them, she knows she is far from perfect. To remedy this, Fury requests aid from Hunger and the CPC in creating this ritual. The civil planners' extensive knowledge of geology and geography provide an excellent resource in deciding how, exactly, this ritual should work. Knowing what specific information is needed and how it can be utilized gives her a much better starting point in determining the scope of the ritual.</p>
<p>While the Fury of a few years ago may have simply just tried to throw her arcane power in the dirt and scream "OPEN WIDE O EARTH AND REVEAL THY SECRETS," today's Fury has learned the folly of such methods. It turns out to be a wise lesson. There were numerous pitfalls that could have harmed her or her staff in the creation of this ritual (much like the 5 month migraine incident,) but careful planning and expert consultants allow her to successfully avoid any such disasters.</p>
<p>In addition, Fury believes she has fixed her ritual chambers. A few "dry runs" of ritual magic confirm that she has successfully adapted the thaumic resonance of her ritual chambers to prevent the potential resonance cascade scenario that the unstable ley lines created. Hells, she now believes that if approached with great caution and planning this instability could be taken advantage of in order to harness great power. She is a bit worried about the unforeseen consequences of such a daring plan, but a little more research may shed light on that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Hunger- Action 1- </strong>The Hunger proves to have several advantages in this field. For one, the affliction lends itself to being disguised. For two, his mask ritual also gave him knowledge of detection magic that will benefit him.</p>
<p>First of all, Hunger adds <em>Nondetection </em>and <em>Alter Self </em>to his list of extracts known. Alter Self allows an immediate Disguise check, and lasts for over an hour when crafted by him and his disguise stays intact if interacted with, unlike <em>Disguise Self. </em>If he then layers it with <em>Nondetection</em>, any attempt to use detect magic will have to pass a caster level check to detect anything. Unfortunately the +10 bonus does not stack with the bonus he already gets, as you can only have so much shapechanger. Well, it'll help in a pinch.</p>
<p>That's when Hunger has a burst of inspiration. Most of these disguises are designed to be variable. He only needs to disguise himself as one thing: Himself.</p>
<p>By combining elements of the <em>Claim Identity </em>extract with his previous mutagen research, he is able to create a concoction that alters himself to a consistent form of himself. This concoction can be used once per day, lasts for 1 hour/level, and allows him to treat his mundane disguise check as having taken 20. This will also only detect as a mutagen, which he can explain. This should help him be able to attend public events without spending 4 or 5 hours making sure his disguise is perfect. If another alchemist got their hands on it they could probably suss out what it does. Nothing can really be done about that.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2- </strong>Once again, Hunger's research is leading him into dicey territory. The problem is a living creature, even one magically altered such as a fire elf, only gives off a thaumic aura if actively using magic. Discussions about innate auras turn out to be the realm of occultism and madmen who think themselves psychic. Hunger quickly discards that madness.</p>
<p>He does quickly determine that while a fire elf at rest does not have a thaumic aura, a fire elf using one of their spell like abilities does. He tweaks his plan to taking arcanic portraiture of fire elves while they are using their natural spell like abilities. Once he has gotten a good sample size, he takes a sample of his own and compares.</p>
<p>Shit, this is hard. The details that make up an individual caster's aura are extremely hard to determine, even on a good day. The level of skill needed to suss out the details is extreme. He is not able to get results in the level of detail he wanted.</p>
<p>However, he is able to suss out a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>His aura is different than baseline. Whether this is due to his affliction or his unique arcane history, he isn't sure.</li>
<li>The dog's aura has similarities to his own. He isn't sure why. Still, a skilled mage might be able to spot the connection.</li>
<li>In an interesting note, his research comes across something potentially helpful. Natural Lycanthropes do not have a thaumic aura when in hybrid or animal form, only when actually shifting. Hunger now knows that the dog does have an aura in hybrid form. This implies it could be dispelled, however this would likely only be a temporary victory. Under a full moon it would likely just shift back, but this would at least burn time.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /><strong>Fury:</strong> The Fury pulls up all of the notes and diagrams she has not had the courage to touch since the conflagration. Surprisingly, she finds she still has most of the notes the Phoenix gave her. She steels herself and reviews them in the detail she should have in the first place.</p>
<p>As she reviews the rituals, she becomes aware of a staggering fact. The Phoenix was <em>always</em> going to die. That was not one of Faustus' additions. This revelation breaks her heart, but not her resolve. She continues to examine the rituals. She finds that the purpose of the ritual was to sacrifice the Phoenix to give Aelia a massive amount of its arcane power, then end with a massive unexpected burst of fiery energy that would destroy everything in the immediate area, but leaving Aelia untouched.</p>
<p>She remembers how miserable the Phoenix was. How much he suffered under Faustus. How often Faustus "killed" him in order to keep him from being too powerful to contain. The constantly matted, stained look of his beautiful white feathers. The pain in his mentally projected voice. She remembers how he described the ritual.</p>
<p><em>"I will set us both free."</em></p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury attempts to research Faustus' modified version of the ritual. Unfortunately, all she has to go on is her hasty sketches of what she saw. As Ink said, "filtered through his memory, through your vision," and now also her unsteady hand as she transcribed what she had seen immediately after the divination like capturing a fading dream.</p>
<p>After that previous revelation, she eventually decides she just does not have the mental or emotional energy left to tackle Faustus' modified ritual. She leaves that part of the problem to sit, for now.</p>
<p>Instead, she spends her time properly mourning her lost friend.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Terror- </strong>It is an arduous climb to the top of the thus yet unnamed mountain closest to Surt. As far as towering peaks go, it's a modest one. However, the mountain is nearly as unstable as the Maar itself. This winter is a particularly cold one, and the Terror finds herself pressing on through colder and icier conditions. The rocks on the narrow cliff faces are sharp and prone to breakage, ledges that seem like good handholds break off, and once placing a climbing piton causes a burst of steam to hit her in the face. This would be good terrain for a dragon. She hopes it's a red one.</p>
<p>It takes her three days to reach the peak. There, amongst the jagged igneous rocks she finds&hellip; nothing. The sharp point of the peak, nothing else. No dragons, no wolves, no slavering monsters for her to slay. Not even any crag elves. Only a lone mountain peak, a layer of ice and snow, and a blanket of complete silence. She is well and truly alone.</p>
<p>She slams her hammer into the mountain side and rips off her helmet and mask. She raises her fists and screams her frustration and pain at the sky. She finds herself cursing and screaming. She begs Calestros for answers <em>for once</em>, then in the same breath curses her for abandoning her to the flames. She curses herself for cursing her deity, then curses herself for being so pathetic. Finally truly alone, she screams out all the pain she has been holding in for decades.</p>
<p>Eventually, it hurts to keep screaming. The sun has gone down and raised up a few times. With nothing left inside her to let out, Aquila falls to her knees. She finds herself praying, for the first time since the conflagration. She doesn't remember how to, or know what to say. She says nothing. She sits in silence, wordlessly desperately hoping for an answer.</p>
<p>Exhaustion sets in. She finds herself swaying on her knees, unable to stand or open her eyes. As a heavy sleep overtakes her, a voice echoes on the edge of her senses.</p>
<p><em>I still love you</em></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>It takes the Terror another three days to descend the mountain. She pauses at a shallow cave along a narrow ridge near the base of the mountain. The sun is about to set. She will rest here and make her return to Surt tomorrow.</p>
<p>As she waits, she notices something. A pawprint. A wolf. Large, but narrow. Terror isn't a tracker, but she's quite perceptive. She searches the cave. More pawprints and bootprints. Pawprints that turn into bootprints. Dark stains that could be blood. It's a confusing scene she doesn't have the skills to make sense of. There are more pawprints leading out of the cave. She leaves the cave to search the ridge.</p>
<p>From the ridge she realizes she has a commanding view of Surt. As the sun sets, Surt stands out against the harsh terrain as a circle of reds and greens, glowing with yellow light. As much as she recognizes this is a tactical vantage point used by an enemy, she takes a moment to acknowledge her new home's beauty.</p>
<p>She looks back to the ridge. A few feet to the right, there is something scratched into the rock. A Lycan rune. Terror examines it carefully. It isn't magic, just scratched into the rock as if with a knife or claw. Dirt and grime cover it, and it is worn and weathered. It has been there for some time. She realizes the prints lead to here, next to this rock, then stop.</p>
<p>It is a single, unlayered rune. It is carved into the rock somewhat crudely, but still clearly. Perhaps in the same way the old runic language was first carved. Oddly, by pure coincidence, Terror recognizes the rune. It's the same as the one that powers much of the enchantment on her hammer.</p>
<p>Fora&eth; - Monster</p>
<p>Unsure the significance, she sits by the rune and watches Surt as the sun goes down. In the dark, it's truly a beautiful thing. She will worry about the significance of this overlook and the rune another time. She sleeps in the open, leaning against the rock facing Surt.</p>

<p id="DogLetter">Governor Goldheart was an intelligent, ambitious, ruthless, cruel, and incredibly vain man. His drive and vision were admirable, but his delusions of grandeur and sadism crippled any achievements he made.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">Barrabus is an idiot, but a potentially useful one.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">I like wine exactly as much as you do. Our sense of taste is better in Hybrid form. I imagine wine may have much more complicated flavors that way, especially ones made by Lycans. We should try it sometime.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">Stop asking stupid questions to which you already know the answers. I am you, and we are something special.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">I have the same ambitions, same desires, same loves and hates. I am not some mad beast that will tell you to murder your own staff. I am you without the fetters you place on yourself. I want what you want. I want the fire elves to thrive.</p>

<td><p id="DogLetter">Well, at least I can't complain about our devotion to empiricism. You want to know more about me? So do I. Let us explore.</p>
<p id="DogLetter"> have been wondering why I am not quite so homicidal as the records of afflicted depict. I have been reading over your shoulder and I have a theory.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">First, Lycans exaggerate how bad the affliction is. Curse, of course, but perhaps they fear what happens if others tame their power.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">Second, I appear to be you, but without many of the moral and ethical chains you bind yourself with. If your average peasant or soldier was free to act out their innermost desires, they would likely just want to kill people they don't like or steal their neighbor's wife or something.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">Our true innermost desire does indeed seem to be the ascendancy of the fire elves, and the foundation and preservation of Surt. Therefore I want what you want, I simply see our path in a different light. That is what makes us special. Not greed or vanity, but pure ambition.</p>

<p>When the Hunger awakens, the door to the cell is wide open. The puzzle lock has been solved. He is unchained. There is a stack of parchment, a quill, and ink next to him. They are blank. He leaps to his feet.</p>
<p>His lab is undamaged. The door is still bolted shut. Several pieces of his lab equipment have been either moved or used. The garden is intact. A quick survey of personnel reveals no suspicious reports and no missing persons.</p>
<p>His mask is sitting out on a table where he did not leave it.</p>
<p>He has no memory of what happened.</p></td>
