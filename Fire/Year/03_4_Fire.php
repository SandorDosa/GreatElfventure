<p><strong>FIRE ELVES ARE ACTIVELY CREATING NEW PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Establishment): Goldrush [the Fury, Barrabus, and the CPC]</p>
<p><em>Action: Create village &lsquo;Disr&rsquo; on the gold deposit three squares WNW of Surt</em></p>
<p>The Fury is a little&hellip; concerned about the Hunger&rsquo;s recent absences. The disappearances in the previous months have mostly been understandable (and explained away as time off for a thoroughly overworked bureaucrat who doesn&rsquo;t know how to stop). However, as of late last winter, the Hunger has been absent from more meetings and events than he&rsquo;s been present for, and at this point he hasn&rsquo;t been seen in public in weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something must be going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the war to the south still ongoing, and issues within Surt still as complicated as ever, the Fury doesn&rsquo;t really have time to investigate for herself. And the CPC, lacking a Hunger to officiate, is looking for Triumvirate members to stand as official support for &ldquo;Project Disr,&rdquo; the plan to claim the (ostensibly) mineral rich mountains to the west north west.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury is happy to provide official support, but has little time for most of the important planning and layout activities -- she&rsquo;s still locked up in overall coordination, civil defense planning, and of course another round of scanning rituals beneath Surt itself. She drags Barrabus into the mix, letting him and the Phoenix Imperialis sign off on CPC plans while she worries about the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>The Council of Firebirds is unaware of the true bounty Disr would rest on, but is still generally eager to help, as this helps cement their political position, provides another settlement that will generally support them, and gives plenty of room for prospecting opportunities of their own. Barry keeps an eye on them, but stays mostly out of the actual civil planning work (apart from making certain there is room enough for walls, and adding a few artistic flourishes where appropriate).&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is more concerned about the Hunger&rsquo;s absence -- and is, in fact, about to investigate, when a strange commotion <a href="https://greatelfventure.azurewebsites.net/Fire/Bonus/23_Bardnapping.php">interrupts the afternoon Council meeting</a>&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=020c3ed2db000010e7a0a08a48961949">Result</a>: 3 advantage, 1 success</p>
<p>But before that commotion occurs, there&rsquo;s a new problem. The terrain leading up to Disr is exceptionally treacherous, and supporting the work crews moving up to Disr&rsquo; site becomes increasingly difficult as time goes on. In an effort to push construction forward, Barrabus coordinates &ldquo;supply runs&rdquo; from Surt&rsquo;s prolific gardeners (adding the <strong>Verdant Rooftop Gardens</strong> bonus die to this check, as the food is passed to Disr&rsquo;s work crews and new settlers), and pushes to make extensive use of the CPC&rsquo;s roadplanning skills to make Disr as connected to Surt as possible (invoking <strong>All Roads lead to Surt / Fortified Roadways</strong>).</p>
<p>Reroll: 5 advantage, 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Almost Got &lsquo;Em [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>Tsun has spent a number of months recovering and resolidifying her base (after some slight embarrassment not very long ago). And during the last season&rsquo;s campaign, her soldiers -- now more unified and organized than ever -- almost managed to catch what Tsun is certain was a Wolf Elf in action.</p>
<p>But almost isn&rsquo;t good enough. Tsun needs a win, and it's high time she got personally involved again, to make sure it happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=372543d6db000010e7a0a08a48961904">Result</a>: 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Conventional Warfare (Defensive Ops): Operation Acme [The Terror and Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p> <em>Includes upgrade from Fire for Effect (1 economy dmg)</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Includes Hot Gates (advantage converted to enemy disadvantage)</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Includes upgrade from Concealed Positions (Fall Year 3)</em></p>
<p><em>Includes upgrade from Trapped Approach (Riverhaven)</em></p>
<p>Acme (&alpha;&kappa;&mu;Î®). Aboleth, noun, meaning &lsquo;peak&rsquo; or &lsquo;zenith&rsquo;. &ldquo;Coyotes&rsquo; bane&rdquo; in some old folklore. The Terror intends to put that to the test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final preparations for the Battle of Riverhaven:</p>
<p>Pre-battle:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Harassment methods (Dreamdust traps, camouflaged raiders and emplacements, and disruption of known resting points along the path to Riverhaven) will be used to weaken approaching forces</li>
<li>Maybe it's just nerves, or memories of how close her last several battles have ended. Maybe its renewed hope, or superstition, or lip service to something that was once her life. <br />Regardless of the source, the Terror is compelled to give service to Calestros before the battle, as she did when she was young, before fire burned it all away. A few days before the battle, she pulls an old vial of ink from her pack, and walks out into the desert to commune. Ink smeared on her face and arms, staring up at the stars, and maintaining a backwards yoga position that keeps her head upside-down, until her eyes fill with streaks "like Calestros' many arms embracing the world"</li>
</ol>
<p>Terror&rsquo;s vision blurs slightly. She can see something. The streaks of ink in her vision shift. They begin to move. Terror can see arms reaching for her. They are not grasping or clawing, but instead reaching out for an embrace.</p>
<p><em>And I never stopped.</em></p>
<p>The vision fades.</p>
<p>in-battle:</p>
<p>Cazadores are known priority targets for Coyzadore units. To take advantage of that:</p>
<ol>
<li> Cazadores unit 1 will stand in formation in front of the Elect. Thanks to coordination between Breaker and Terror, Cazadores 1 will wait for inevitable charge from Coyzadores units, and then pull back behind the Elect (as an immediate action), allowing the Elect to accept the Coyzadores charge (also as an immediate action). Other units can then move in and attempt to finish off the Coyzadores.</li>
<li> Cazadores unit 2 will stand in formation adjacent to the Chevaliers unit, which will provide its teamwork bonus to Cazadores 2, allowing the Chevaliers to intercept charges aimed for them. At the Coyzadores' charge, the Chevaliers will accept the charge in place of them, and engage the Coyzadores long enough for additional units to move in and lock the Coyzadores.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cazadore units can then move to engage enemy heavy infantry units, in an attempt to remove them from the field. Heavy infantry will focus on removing the Coyzadores before they can respond, and will then attempt to push enemy light infantry from the field. Archers and other ranged units will focus on disrupting light infantry first, as they're likely to break early.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=11cd3405db000010e7a0a08a489619f8%26sysparm_view=Player">Results</a>: 2 advantage, 2 successes, 1 triumph</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Magic): Ritual Homicide [the Fury] (Deep Scan)</p>
<p> <em>Includes bonus die from Winter Year 3</em></p>
<p>The Fury is irritated. And maybe a little stressed out. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s going to give up. She just needs to pour more effort into it. And maybe, just maybe, play a little smarter.</p>
<p>So trying to read through the ley lines isn&rsquo;t working. But what about &ldquo;from&rdquo; the ley lines? They should be directly impacted by the sizeable groundswell of energy beneath them. Maybe the trick to understanding the Marr is to read the magic flowing through it, and try to determine what that says about the physical world. Study the auric movement to determine how deep the magma pocket beneath goes, and maybe what its made of.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=61e08b56db000010e7a0a08a4896196f">Results</a>: 1 advantage</p>
<p>Okay, that didn&rsquo;t help in the slightest. Clearly working smarter is not the Fury&rsquo;s forte. ...Or maybe she just doesn&rsquo;t have enough at stake.</p>
<p>Fury concentrates on her own part in this. If this lava vent goes up, all of their work in Surt will have been for naught. All of the people who survived Muspelham will be dead. All of the work they put into building a future for themselves will be gone. And history will remember the elves of Muspelham as&hellip; slaves. Slaves and victims, lost but ultimately meaningless in the endless swell of history.</p>
<p>All she&rsquo;ll ever have been is a foolish girl, enslaved to a tyrant.</p>
<p><strong>Fury invokes her High Concept, and spends 1 fate point to reroll this check.</strong></p>
<p>Reroll: 2 successes, 1 Triumph</p>
<p>...Fury has learned &ldquo;work angrier, not smarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action:</strong></p>
<p>Research!</p>
<p>What the Hunger knows:</p>
<ol>
<li> This is a divine curse, and the only known counters involve divine cures. Thus, the only cure must involve accepting a divine power or its equivalent. So which divine source are we touching here?</li>
<li> The fact that the Tourist hasn't killed him even when he's outside of Surt suggests that either the Tourist is 100% unaware that he could be infected (which is a little suspicious), or secondary exposure came from another source. He knows he's been down this path before; this is just... suspicious.</li>
<li> All of the evidence seems to suggest that the Dog is now effectively a part of him -- thus, whatever this particular ritual is trying to do must specifically involve changing one's self. So what is it attempting to transform him to? Something that cannot effectively be a Lycanthrope... such as an Outsider?</li>
<li> The change effect itself can be dispelled, but not permanently. That implies that the change itself is a Transformation effect, but that its inherent to the body at this point.</li>
<li> For all this talk about "being part of the core", there's a whole lot of "replacing the existing personality with a new one" going on here. I understand it is supposed to mimic the worst traits of the old one... but it seems more like the typical "just like the old one, but BETTERER" mantra popular with Bellaphex and her assorted worshippers. Which fits, as its a Bellaphexian curse, but the implication of a "cure that would resolve a divine curse that replaces the old personality with a new personality with Bellaphexian traits" suggests that the cure would either have to (a) function just like the better known divine cures, and are thus unreliable, or (b) replace the personality of the subject with a new personality that amplifies non-Bellaphexian traits. And that doesn't fit my old mentor, unless her goal is to push me towards a non-Bellaphexian version that still fits her definition of "gets things done". So, possibility to consider: "cure" is in fact a method to slap infernal or other outsider influence over my core personality so that it no longer qualifies for Lycanthropy, and revokes the Bellaphexian personality change to replace it with an infernal personality change.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Garrison (0/2):</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cool! Whatever is happening with the Hunger, he clearly has the ability to delegate and select competent underlings. The CPC needs little more than a rubber stamp of Triumvirate approval to get underway, they have everything they need already lined up.</p>
<p>In fact, they get more than they ask for. Eager to demonstrate that Surt&rsquo;s successes come from internal sources as much as external, Barrabus directs the PI to work with the CPC in aqcuiring resources for the new settlement.</p>
<p>Upon learning the classified information of what, exactly, Disr&rsquo;s actually purpose will be, the Firebirds and PI associated merchants funnel a frankly alarming amount of resources, personnel, and cold hard coin into getting Disr operational.</p>
<p><br />With the extra resources, the CPC is not only able to get the settlement up and running, they are able to turn the <em>Gold Vein</em> Aspect into a proper <em>Gold Mine!</em> Eager to produce returns, the PI invest heavily in the settlement. They burn most of their remaining cash reserves, but the settlement should start producing usable gold ore next season. If this goes as scheduled and this pesky war goes the right way, the PI will be happy indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Eager to turn the political initiative, Tsun does not rest on her laurels. Desperate not to get left behind by the ascendant Phoenix Imperialis, she leans on her newer wealthier supporters to reinvent the Praesidium - more professional recruiting and standards, more widespread propaganda, better training and facilities. They start to become a more serious force of their own. Tsun puts them to use right away. With a war on the horizon, security is paramount.</p>
<p>After months of helping keep Surt secure, Tsun has a break. A serious, serious break.</p>
<p>Note: The exact chain of events here has some input from you.</p>
<p>Praesidium Patrols corner a uniformed blade elf who is acting unusual and moving alone at night. After a brief interrogation, the blade elf attacks the patrol. They are able to subdue him, but he shockingly breaks free and hurls himself into a nearby crate of Alchemist's fire, killing himself to avoid capture and burning his body beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Tsun keeps it quiet after the initial event. She wants to use this to her maximum advantage. She finds out all the information she can about this blade elf. The patrol had gotten some information and confiscated his belongings before his death. His identity was fake, his uniform generic. The blade elf guardselves have no records of this man, nor is anyone from their official duty roster listed as missing.</p>
<p>Most shockingly, and what Tsun has the biggest decision on her hands about, is what he was carrying. This spy was carrying documents apparently stolen from the palace itself. They tell a shocking story:</p>
<p>The Hunger is an afflicted werewolf, and has been hiding it ever since that fateful day he was bitten. He has given in to his bestial nature, and routinely killed Palace staff and fire elves. Worse, the blade elves knew about it the whole time. Hunger was favorable to them, so in order to keep him on their side and in power, they helped him cover it up. Worse, they find evidence that the blade elves actually <em>helped</em> him find innocent people to kill and eat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shocking revelation, but by the time Tsun gathers this information Hunger has already left for the potluck.</p>
<p>What she does now is up to you, but please discuss her course of action with me before writing her next turn. </p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> The <strong>Battle of Riverhaven</strong> was a stunning success and a decisive victory. Coyote will no longer threaten you or your allies.</p>
<p>The combined force of dreamdust elves, Vaquero elves, fire elves, winged elves, and Machakw win a decisive victory in defense of the city against a larger enemy force. The Terror&rsquo;s excellent defensive plan, as well as outstanding leadership by allied commanders, and a little bit of luck (and a lot of bagpipes) allowed for the victory.</p>
<p>Winged elf scouts managed to report the size and location of Coyote&rsquo;s forces well before the arrived - 1400 troops in total: 800 militia, 400 soldiers, and 200 Cazadores. The huge force was slowed down by the complex network of traps that the dreamdust elves had laid. Navigating the traps added hours of delay to their advance. With the advanced warning, the defenders had time to arrange their forces.</p>
<p>Terror laid out her cavalry trap carefully, and set up the most elite units the elves had to defend the center. Vitally, the dreamdust elves prepared concealed positions on the flanks. The Machakw raider forces lay in wait, prepared to enclose the attacking Coyotes in a pincer maneuver.</p>
<p>No plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this day was no different. Coyote had fought alongside Breaker for years, and knew her tactics and capabilities well. He was able to successfully guess that Terror would use Breaker as bait for a cavalry charge. He did not fall for the trap. When he began his attack, he feinted a charge for Breaker with one unit of Cazadores. After Breaker maneuvered away from the charge, the first unit abruptly changed course for the weakest part of the fire elf lines while Coyote and his Cazadores charged around the fire elf lines to take a shot at Breaker.</p>
<p>It almost worked. By sheer luck, the route he chose for his surprise charge took his unit directly through the concealed position in which Hashkeh and his elite Machakw raiders lay in wait. Unable to see the position in time, Coyote&rsquo;s Cazadores were well into the unit&rsquo;s formation when Hashkeh sprung an attack. With weapons specifically designed to take riders off of horses, the Machakw tore into the Coyotes in a surprise close quarters assault.</p>
<p>Further, the fire elf Chevaliers were able to intercept the second unit of Cazadores that was charging the Milites, who would have likely been destroyed in the attack. As the initial charge floundered and the front lines erupted in battle, the rest of the Coyote forces engaged the allied lines.</p>
<p>Coyote&rsquo;s Cazadores were quickly surrounded by fire and dreamdust elf units. Unable to bring the fury of a charge onto the surrounding infantry, Coyote attempted to punch through a gap between Machakw and dreamdust forces. Just as his forces were reaching open ground and about to pull back, Breaker intervened.</p>
<p>She had seen Coyote&rsquo;s unit get trapped and quickly maneuvered her Cazadores to exploit his position. As soon as Coyote had created an opening large enough, she threw all of her quite considerable wrath into a ferocious cavalry charge, with her in the lead.</p>
<p>Breaker&rsquo;s charge was one of the most astoundingly violent cavalry charges anyone on the field had ever witnessed. It was a hit so ruthless and so bloody even Lycan shock cavalry would blanch. Coyote&rsquo;s Cazadores had already taken severe losses, and were unable to resist the fury of the charge. Breaker herself was the tip of the spear, tearing through the exhausted enemy until she found Coyote and killed him herself. Buenos Dias, Fuckboy.</p>
<p>Coyote was taken off the field with such surprising speed that he was unable to relay orders to his troops to adapt to the suddenly changed battlefield. His elite forces marched on the center and attempted to divide the allied line while the massed militia maintained their squares on the flanks, staying in formation.</p>
<p>The Coyote forces had no secondary leader. There was no one left who Coyote trusted enough to share the duties of command. Without leadership, the Coyote military kept following the initial plan. The Cazadores and soldiers kept fighting in the center, but were slowly overwhelmed by the elite fire elf and dreamdust elf forces. </p>
<p>The winged elves engaged the archers ferociously. The frontline soldiers had been expecting volleys of arrows to keep their foes at bay, but with the constant attack runs of the Harriers and accurate long range fire of the SkyHawks, they were unable to support the main force.</p>
<p>The Militia stayed in ranks on the sides. They were expecting an order to press the center once the elite forces made a foothold, but with Coyote dead that order never came. Most of the militia stayed in formation and did not directly engage in combat. A few units of Machakw and dreamdust elves were able to engage their front ranks and keep the bulk of the militia from being involved in the battle.</p>
<p>With no support, the elite frontline soldiers slowly collapsed under attack from the superior numbers of allied frontline troops. As the survivors fled the battlefield, Coyote&rsquo;s forces began to unravel. Machakw broke through the Coyote lines and engaged the archers, nearly tearing them apart, and the last unit of Cazadores turned to flee. Their elite forces were broken.</p>
<p>With the army collapsing, Breaker again charged the remaining enemy Cazadores. They hit their former allies hard. A couple dozen survivors began to flee into the desert. Instead of pursuing, Breaker turned around and returned to the center of the battlefield. Standing on her horse and holding her new banner high, she called out for the remaining Coyote forces to surrender.</p>
<p>With nowhere left to turn, they did so. While the bulk of the militia was still intact, they had no leadership and no remaining professional army to support. They were not loyal enough to Coyote&rsquo;s cause to continue the attack, and indeed many of them still felt loyal to Breaker.</p>
<p>The scattered surviving soldiers surrendered, but surprisingly the remaining Militia formally declared that they were defecting to Breaker&rsquo;s Vaqueros.</p>
<p>Riverhaven is still a mess. There are currently more soldiers than civilians in the city, and there is plenty of post-battle chaos as the allied military decides what to do with surrendered enemy forces and where to go next. Learning that the siege of Coldwater is ongoing, Breaker is determined to gather her new militia and her Cazadores and go to Coldwater to take it for herself.</p>
<p>As one of your allies. Of course.</p>
<p>The <strong>Siege of Coldwater</strong> begins on a high note. The river elves successfully infiltrate the Fort. Using Rulyrana's maps and their knowledge of Lycan fort building, their engineers are able to stealthily sabotage the Fort's defenses, as well as the outer walls. Coyote guards do eventually manage to spot the river elf saboteurs, but by the time they do it is far too late.</p>
<p>The walls of the Fort crumble, as do the gatehouses and armories, leaving the Fort essentially indefensible. Further, a large breach is created in the outer wall as the blade and dark elf forces arrive, allowing them to enter the city and immediately begin their attack.</p>
<p>This is where things start getting difficult. The Coyote officer in charge of the defenses, a man called Hawk, turns out to be surprisingly competent and shockingly ruthless. As the attack begins, the remaining division of soldiers abandons the ruined fort and make their stand in the city itself.</p>
<p>Hawk uses the situation to his advantage. The river elves had deliberately left openings for civilians to evacuate, but Hawk deliberately traps civilians in harm's way. Thanks to the river elves a large number are able to escape, but hundreds are still left in the city and trapped between the two armies.</p>
<p>Worse, Hawk sets up his headquarters at the church, the sturdiest building left standing. Mat&iacute;as had been using it as an emergency field hospital for civilians, but Hawk traps them there. He uses this group as leverage, threatening to kill them if his position is attacked or if the Militia lose their nerve.</p>
<p>The desperate Militia fight with surprising ferocity. The blade elves are not used to close quarters urban fighting, and with Katiin unwillingly to risk massive civilian casualties she commands them conservatively. Their offensive quickly stalls, bogged down in the city. The dark elves attempt to help, but even though they manage to slip through the Militia lines unnoticed they are unable to unstick the defending force from their home turf.</p>
<p>This goes on for weeks, then over a month. It starts to look like this is going to turn into a grueling urban siege. The blade elves begin establishing their own defenses, preparing for months of grueling urban operations.</p>
<p>Litoria, Katiin, and Trischal consider their options. With the dark elf sappers hiding behind enemy lines and the river elves still holding the docks, the two stealthy forces could make a surprise attack on the church itself. The position is fortified and there are civilian lives in the balance, but they won't get another shot and the position will only get more fortified with time.</p>
<p>That's when the Crag arrive. Furious at the "distraction" that the Coyote elves are causing, Echo descends from the mountains with the Euclast. Though they are the smallest force in the battle, they attack with shocking intensity. They don't even pause to rest. As soon as Echo has received a brief situation report, the Euclast attack the center of the Coyote forces and make a push for the stronghold.</p>
<p>With fresh troops, experience in close quarters fighting due to their mountainous home environment, and an aggressive strategy that has little regard for collateral damage, the Crag immediately begin to tip the scales.</p>
<p>This is causing a problem, however. Echo has only the barest cooperation with his ostensible allies, and appears to have a poor grasp of the situation. While they are handily succeeding tactically, Echo does not appear to understand the situation with the civilians. While they are definitely avoiding killing noncombatants, they do not appear to have the cultural context to understand why the Coyotes would hold their own people hostage and are thus ignoring it.</p>
<p>Realizing that the Crag are going to have a breakthrough, Litoria and Trischal predict that the Crag will make a push for the church. With little heed for the delicate situation, the Crag's attack will be seen coming and thus doom the hostages in the building.</p>
<p>With little choice and only a brief window, the dark and river elves decide that they must raid the church and free the hostages before the Crag break through the lines.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the weather is on their side. When they launch this operation, the sun is setting and a rare rainstorm is rolling in.</p>
<p>Using the poor visibility to their advantage, Trischal and Rulyrana scout the fortified church. The defenders have fortified the pavilion in front of the church, with infantry and archers watching the surrounding streets. They have build defensive barricades and scattered caltrops, broken glass, and sharpened stakes in the streets in front of the barricades. They have also deployed sharp eyed archers on the church roof, which Trischal is narrowly able to avoid being spotted by. The weather is on her side, for once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the exterior scouted but the situation inside the church still unknown, the elves decide that they can't risk detection by getting too close to the building. They prepare for the attack with the information they have.</p>
<p>The dark elf sappers decide that since patrols regularly watch the outside of the building, the safest way to breach the church's walls is to dig through the floor in a nearby building and then dig under the street and collapse the wall by destroying the foundation directly under it.</p>
<p>Despite a bit of time lost from a surprisingly sturdily built apartment floor, the dark elves manage to tunnel under the street and sabotage the wall without being detected and in good time. Knowing it's the signal to attack, the veteran sappers pull the structural supports and cause the wall to collapse and create a hole.</p>
<p>The rest of the dark elf sappers, led by Trischal, immediately rush the opening. Inside, they find nearly 150 civilians presses against the back side of the building. Hawk and some of his elite infantry are guarding them. None of them expected this.</p>
<p>Seizing the initiative, Trischal and the veterans descend on Hawk's group in a ferocious surprise attack. They press the advantage and the junior sappers surround the shocked infantry. Their attack decimates the unprepared infantry, completely disabling them and killing Hawk in the process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hearing the attack begin, the river elves immediately assault the most heavily defended section of the barricades. The Crocodilians hit it with shocking speeds and force, driving the defenders off the wall as the Archerfish's arrows pin down their allies. Riding Sauvier, Litoria punches a hole straight through the center of the barricade and the Crocodilians rush into the square.</p>
<p>Seeing their defenses overwhelmed in mere moments, the remaining defenders retreat into the church while the rooftop arches attempt to force the river elves back. Inside, they encounter the dark elves.</p>
<p>The dark elves form a defensive line, preventing the enemy soldiers from reaching the civilians. Eina and her healer team rush into the church and begin healing and evacuating the civilians with help from a very surprised Mat&iacute;as.</p>
<p>The heavy infantry put their backs to the wall, preventing the dark elves from using their preferred tactics and flanking. Forced into a head on fight, the sappers do their best to hold the heavy infantry at bay while the civilians escape.</p>
<p>Outside, the Crocodilians attempt to break into the church itself but come under fire from the rooftop archers. The Archerfish exchange fire, drawing the attention of the enemy marksmen.</p>
<p>With surprising nerve, the lightly armed and armored sappers hold the line against the elite heavy infantry long enough for the civilians to escape. With the civilians safe and the defenses smashed, they make the call to fall back. They are taking casualties, and the Crag can handle what's left.</p>
<p>The swift sappers and Crocodilians flee into the rainy night with the civilians in tow, having taken few losses for what they gained and leaving the fortifications ruined. They took out nearly half the defending forces.</p>
<p>The Crag smash through the Militia lines and storm the church a couple of hours later. Surprisingly they find the enemy stronghold broken, with dozens of dead Coyotes in the streets. The remaining soldiers have holed up in the church itself.</p>
<p>The church is a stone building.</p>
<p>The Crag make short work of the walls and assault the soldiers within. Weakened, leaderless, and demoralized, they give up disappointingly quickly.</p>
<p>With Coyote and Hawk dead, the soldiers defeated, and their families safe, the Militia quickly surrender the following day.</p>
<p>Coldwater is yours, for now. Breaker is apparently coming to take control. If that is acceptable, Alpha Division volunteers to hold the city until Breaker returns.</p>
<p>If you trust her, that is.</p>
<p>The Chevaliers have suffered Light Casualties. All other units avoided significant casualties.</p>
<p>For surviving their first real battle, the Milites and Ashkin both gain the <strong>Experienced I</strong> Aspect. The Chevaliers, being recruited at a higher level, do not yet have the Experienced Aspect, but make very significant progress towards it.</p>
<p>Note: Riverhaven is safe and Coldwater is under allied control. Katiin, leading the largest force, takes the responsibility of occupying Coldwater until Breaker can organize the Vaqueros to return to the city and presumably take control of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surt is too far for the Charred Eagles to make it all the way back until next turn (the farthest they can get is Alfyr,) but things are stable enough that Terror is able to reach the potluck.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>The Fury has had <em>absolutely enough of this.</em></p>
<p>She takes all her normal precautions in casting the ritual, which has never caused her nearly so much trouble outside of Surt. And yet, once again, she can feel the ritual fizzling for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>No. Not this time.</p>
<p>She won&rsquo;t let it happen again. The memory of the ritual in Muspalham is in the back of her head. She won&rsquo;t let it happen again. She won&rsquo;t let her ignorance doom the people who depend on her. She will not let their story end here, not when she can still do something about this. She will not make the mistake of failing to understand a magic threat ever again.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s wrong. Something is resisting her. This isn&rsquo;t just some mistake in her casting, this is something actively trying to stop her. <em>No.</em></p>
<p>The Fury pours all of her intensity into the ritual. She hurls herself into the teeth of the storm, channels every once of arcane power she can touch into it. Unstable ley lines? Why not. Use those too. A previously unknown font of magical energy is hurled into the ritual, doubling its power.</p>
<p><em>Open wide, oh earth, and reveal thy secrets!</em></p>
<p>And the earth answers. A booming voice echoes through the ritual chamber, loud enough to be heard outside the palace, shouting in Ignan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong><em>QUIT BOTHERING ME!</em></strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>And immense swell of magical energy is hurled back at the Fury. Thankfully, she really isn&rsquo;t the idiot slave girl anymore. She&rsquo;s able to remember the numerous safeties she built into the ritual chamber so many seasons ago. She channels the uncontrollable energy into the reservoirs of the ritual chambers. As they are designed to do, they vent the dangerous energy. It takes the form of a sixty foot tall gout of orange flame firing into the sky above Surt, seconds after the voice.</p>
<p>Honestly, people who live near the palace are used to this kind of shit by now.</p>
<p>The energy dissipates harmlessly. Fury quickly checks on her ritual assistants. Aside from some ringing ears, they are unhurt. The chambers are undamaged. The ley lines are stable.</p>
<p>The Fury&rsquo;s namesake may have powered the ritual, but the careful planning she has learned to do prevented a disaster.</p>
<p>Now she just has to figure out what in Hell (hopefully not literally) caused that.</p>
<p><br />On the upswing, channeling that much energy into the Deep Scan ritual make some flaws in its design apparent. Fury and her ritual staff are easily able to correct them now that they&rsquo;ve seen what the ritual does at maximum power. <strong>The difficulty of the Deep Scan ritual has been permanently reduced by one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hunger </strong>makes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lhYBx3PQGAAI7KcRt1kFzaeEJIIC743qO1uJiZ6WJC0/edit?usp=drivesdk">a simple decision.</a></p>
<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have survived another year in your new homeland!</p>
<p>You receive your usual skill point to be distributed as you wish (don't forget your tower,) but the end of this year marks a major occasion.</p>
<p>The Coyotes posed a significant threat. This threat was addressed not just by one or two elven nations, but by all of you working together in a major combined operation. For the first time since the end of the war, you have displayed what you are capable of when the elves band together. Though your cooperation was tenuous at best and your ties still far from cemented, the display of force was quite impressive.</p>
<p>Due to the lessons of this conflict that were shared among all allied elves, you receive the Civilization Aspect <em>Lessons of the Coyote War.</em></p>
<p>This Aspect may be invoked if a situation may be helped by the lessons and experiences your elves received in this conflict.</p>
<p>In addition, this Aspect provides a <strong>permanent upgrade </strong>to either one skill of your choice under the <strong>military branch </strong>or Logistics.</p>
