<p><strong>FIRE ELVES ain&rsquo;t got no PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mercantilism (Venture): Equinox Festival [the Fury and Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p><em>Includes a Bonus Die from Verdant Rooftop Gardens [uses this die for year 2]</em></p>
<p>With the sudden need to reorganize her carefully crafted ritual chambers, the revelation of her role in the Conflagration, the landslide, the migraines&hellip; the Fury has had a rough year and a quarter. And while she&rsquo;s been busy chasing one disaster after another, the city has expanded dramatically, thanks to a massive influx of familiar faces and the Civil Planning Committee&rsquo;s wonderful work on the Rooftop Garden project. So why not give the newcomers a warm welcome?</p>
<p>The Fury decides to take her time in rebuilding her ritual chambers, and instead focus her efforts on a citywide Solstice Festival. With the (somewhat begrudging) agreement of the Hunger, the Fury diverts the garden&rsquo;s recent surplus crops [the Verdant Rooftop Gardens&rsquo; bonus die] towards the festival; the city is a little too strained on building materials for anything more than low-key decorations, but the Fury is pretty certain that large quantities of free food will make up for that (especially with those Fire Elves that were starving until recently).&nbsp;</p>
<p>She also takes the time to assert her position with the Ashen community, encouraging the friendlier and more approachable Ashen sections to hold demonstrations, rallies, and general parties, showing off their ideas and culture to a newer audience. Neither the Terror nor the Hunger are fans of this, but the Fury insists that this will strengthen the more reasonable side of the Ashen sects, as well as put her in a better position to resist Tsun&rsquo;s attempts to control the whole movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as the plans for the Festival are announced, the Phoenix Imperialis&rsquo; lead merchants seize the opportunity for economic growth (and to force Barrabus to make up for his recent absence), charging Barrabus Leafstorm with organizing the foodstalls and decorating committees. Barrabus also scrounges up Surt&rsquo;s resident bards (by offering to pay them), organizing a pro-Imperialis &ldquo;concert&rdquo; set near <em>the Howl</em>. While he and the Fury mostly try to stay out of each other&rsquo;s way, Barrabus is more than happy to coordinate his plans *with* a few carefully selected Ashen gatherings. Firedancer shows can only improve the concert&rsquo;s success, and holding his own performance during the middle of the Ashwalker&rsquo;s rally might certainly steal some of their potential attendees.</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Newcomers [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>Despite being effectively on the outs (and still technically assigned to &ldquo;ranger duty&rdquo;, with the actual rangers being deliberately kept back to help train up more team members), Auburn Tsun still has enough influence with the Praesidium to keep the various Ashen teams monitoring for outside spies and Lycan infiltration. With complaints mounting and the Terror monitoring more closely, Tsun orders the Praesidium to go with a &ldquo;quieter&rdquo; strategy, and work on inspecting anyone entering or leaving Surt. She also organizes the Praesidium to help &ldquo;guard and secure&rdquo; the Fury&rsquo;s festival, hoping that will boost Ashwalker recruitment, and enforce the idea that she&rsquo;s still in charge.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=40b7d716db023300e7a0a08a489619e7">Roll</a>: 2 advantage</p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Reconnaissance (Pathfinders): Burnt Ridge Mountains [the Smoke]</p>
<p>Even with increasing &ldquo;Lycan&rdquo; activity in the area, Surtian infrastructure must expand. Without its own source of metal for armaments and industry, Surt&rsquo;s ability to expand and defend itself will eventually falter. To that end, the Terror assigns Grassforest to coordinate with the Pathfinder teams, in order to explore the area surrounding the metal deposit the Fury&rsquo;s arcanist team managed to detect the previous season, as well as [the square directly between Surtian explored territory and that metal deposit]. The Terror believes the mountains above Surt may not yet have a Lycan presence, but even so, she instructs Grassforest to tread lightly, maintain discipline, and to pull her Pathfinder units at the first sign of risk. For her part, Grassforest is extremely eager to pull this off successfully.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=21331896dbca3300e7a0a08a489619cb">Roll</a>: 1 advantage</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): Goods Intentions [the Hunger]</p>
<p>Even with the Civil Planning Committee&rsquo;s victory with the successful creation of widespread rooftop agriculture, the Hunger knows he cannot rest. Surt now has the food it needs, but survival depends on expansion, and on access to resources Surt alone cannot provide. The Hunger&rsquo;s ambition is relentless -- as long as Surt still needs *something*, he cannot and will not stop.</p>
<p>Still, that&rsquo;s not true with all of the CPC&rsquo;s members. He quietly sections off the majority of them to work on the Fury&rsquo;s festival project (hopefully a more relaxing project overall), while keeping the rest cycling between that and heavy research into future road and dock sites, and overall road construction formula. If Surt is to expand, there will need to be connections between Surt and all future outposts, as well as a permanent lakeside dock to assist the River Elves with their trades. Either option will make the establishment of a future outpost or village significantly easier.</p>

<p><strong>The Hunger&rsquo;s Secret:</strong></p>
<p>Scrawled in chalk on the Sanctum&rsquo;s wall: <em>Play Dead</em></p>
<p>So, first, some meta-analysis. The dog clearly understands language, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily retain all of his memories, else it would understand the puzzle-lock, and not need to re-examine the vents. The Hunger determines its possible that the dog might &lsquo;remember&rsquo; more of his awake-time as the condition lingers, just as he&rsquo;s remembering more of the dog&rsquo;s time; that&rsquo;s something to watch out for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research suggests that the curse is effectively spun off from the &ldquo;originator&rsquo;s&rdquo; soul, rather than the host&rsquo;s. That *might* imply the dog is limited to the Tourist&rsquo;s abilities, personality, and intellect. That&rsquo;s not a&hellip; great improvement, as all three are either unknown or very powerful, but that last one might mean that the Hunger still has the advantage when it comes to alchemy, mechanical skill, and&hellip; arcana.</p>
<p>Step 1: Arcana is one area that he *hasn&rsquo;t* properly explored yet. And this curse, while divine in nature, may have some aspects that are visible to arcanic analysis, but not so much to conventional alchemy. The Hunger pieces together a series of arcanoreactive alchemical &ldquo;tests&rdquo;, and places them in an innocuous spot close to the Sanctum&rsquo;s ceiling. If properly prepared, these tests will react to the Hunger&rsquo;s aura during the change, and thus provide something that can be analyzed after the fact. [Craft Alchemy: 23, Knowledge Arcana: 34]</p>
<p>Step 2: Dog disabling testing. The Hunger stays up, eats little, and exercises significantly on the nights just before the change, attempting to make himself reasonably fatigued so the poison will have a greater effect. Then, on the night of the change, he locks himself in the Sanctum a little early, and doses himself with Dreamelf poison. If this works well, he strongly considers doing some more serious poison research (and maybe retraining to the Concentrate Poison discovery).</p>
<p>Step 3: The concept that the &ldquo;tumor&rdquo; has become part of the victim&rsquo;s &ldquo;self&rdquo; is concerning&hellip; but there might be a way to use that. Several more &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; alchemical concepts, such as mutagens, rely heavily on the concept of directly affecting the subject&rsquo;s &lsquo;morphogenic field&rsquo;, ie the etheric parameters that define the subject&rsquo;s physical and cognitive form (some call this a &ldquo;soul&rdquo;, yes). The Hunger decides to explore and experiment with alchemical solutions that would allow him to alter the dog&rsquo;s physical and mental characteristics (i.e. he tries to create a simple &lsquo;mutagen&rsquo; that will only alter him after he transforms into the dog, and will only do something minor, such as cause the dog&rsquo;s body hair to fall out). Should this work, it should be visible on the test reactants. [Craft Alchemy: 26, Knowledge Arcana: 20]</p>
<p>Step 4: Some theories about familiar creation suggest that some familiars, such as homunculi or &ldquo;tumor familiars&rdquo;, actually operate on a breakoff extension of their owner&rsquo;s soul. Further research is necessary; perhaps it is possible to force the tumor into an external creation. [Knowledge Arcana: 31]</p>
<p>Step 5: Time to grow and develop some extremely dangerous plants! Step one is to build an isolated growing area adjacent to the palace of government. He picks a segment not terribly far from his lab, builds a new growing platform, and surrounds it in decently high walls, with only one entrance, and a mesh of iron bars over the top. The inside is designed so that no one on the walkway or actively harvesting the plants can fall face-first into the waterway, as a protection against drowning. This area is then clearly marked as the &ldquo;dangerous plants&rdquo; section, with specific instructions on the walls (and given to the guards) on what Azure Lilies are and what they can do (and that attempting to harvest them is extremely hard, so no one gets any funny ideas). Finally, its time for planting attempt one! [Knowledge Nature: 22]</p>

<h3>Fall Year 2 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Results-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Misc- </strong>Early in the season, a package arrives for Hunger delivered by a winged elf messenger. The package has no other information on it other than a small handwritten addendum that says &ldquo;Wait for reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the messenger claims the package was inspected, Hunger doubtlessly checks it over half a dozen times with anything he can think of. It appears to be a mundane, nonmagical, nontrapped, nonpoisinous package. He opens it.</p>
<p>Inside is 350gp worth of miscellaneous coins along with a small note-</p>
<p>Innkeeper</p>
<p>I hear I have an outstanding fine</p>
<p>I am paying it</p>
<p>Now get off my back</p>
<p><br />The winged elf messenger dutifully waits for a reply. </p>
<p>The Hunger quickly scrawls a return message, hands it to the messenger, and tips him 4gp.<br /><br />The message reads:<br />"Tourist,<br />While I am thrilled to see you try to take responsibility for your actions, I'm afraid that, for the safety of this city, you are still banned from Surt and subsidiary properties. Your fine payment is accepted, however.<br />To quote many civic authorities before me, 'And don't do it again.'<br />Sincerely,<br />The Innkeeper."</p>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>It seems that the Fury was not the only fire elf that needed to blow off a little steam, figuratively and literally.</p>
<p>Her idea for a festival turns out to be a massive hit and her job becomes less organizing a party and more controlling the surge of activity she begins by starting the idea rolling. This last year has put extreme stress on all levels of fire elf society, and as it turns out a lot of people were holding back a growing bubble of anxiety and fear. By deciding to celebrate Surt&rsquo;s legitimately incredible achievements, as well as celebrate fire elf culture, Fury is proving that there <em>is </em>&nbsp;something such as a fire elf culture. By throwing this celebration, she is promising that there is a bright future ahead for such a strange creature as a fire elf.</p>
<p>Further, by deciding to actively involve most of the various factions in Surt in the planning of the event, it goes off surprisingly apolitical. Sure, the Ashen and the Imperialis argue and clash, but the tone of the event is less about cutting down the opposition and more why showing off why your faction is awesome. Indeed, <em>all</em> of the factions grow in membership. The Phoenix Imperialis concert goes off fabulously, with a refreshed Barrabus showing off a few catchy river elf tunes (they get stuck in your head easily,) and also notably the more moderate Ashen grow in acceptance - particularly the firedancers, as they are a rousing hit throughout the entire event. Turns out naked fire dancing is actually pretty universally popular, but in addition many firedancer followers create beautiful decorations of colored flames and show off fabulous artwork. They demonstrate that fire elves can create art that no one else is capable of, either physically or mentally. Fueled by the party, the firewalker sect grows tremendously and ends up landing somewhere between the Phoenix and other Ashen. Tsun manages to gain some amount of support for her Ashwalker faction - after all, she&rsquo;s damn good at public speaking - but fiery public lashings of dangers lurking in every corner just aren&rsquo;t as popular as rousing concerts with people showing off their smokin&rsquo; bods. Typical.</p>
<p>And of course, by very publicly fronting the event and by going out of her way to include multiple factions, the Fury is able to rally a significant amount of support for the Triumvirate. The fire elves are starting to finally truly believe in both their identity as a fire elf being a valid thing worth being prideful of, and in their future as a whole. Overall, the opinion is that the Triumvirate are the ones to thank for this.</p>
<p>Reflecting the festival&rsquo;s rousing success in bringing some peace to Surt, the city now has the temporary aspect <em>Cathartic Unity.</em> It will expire after 2 turns or when it is invoked. The stability created by the Fury is conditional, but tangible.</p>
<p><br />The only real downside is that you kind of went all out on your food stores, meaning you will have a <strong>setback die</strong> on any checks relating to food supplies next turn. Thankfully, between the gardens and trade with Fort Alfyr, you have a steady food supply now and your stores will easily recover.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Tsun takes a little more ah, balanced approach this time. As opposed to an inquisition, the Praesidium start acting more like a real security force. This of course causes friction with your actual professional guard force. Still, with the extra security needed due to the party even they have little room to argue.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an incident involving a group of thugs dragging a young woman into a back alley for nefarious purposes late one night. A Praesidium patrol was closest and managed to rescue the woman before she was harmed. And publicly beat the tar out of the offenders, of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tsun uses this and her knack for public speaking to her advantage, arguing that this proves the need for the Praesidium as the actual guards would have been spread too thin to intervene.</p>
<p>Overall their reputation improves, but ironically in attempting to appear to be a real security force with standards, they do get a bit more professional.</p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> Unfortunately for the Smoke&rsquo;s first outing, pathfinding the harsh terrain of the Burning Maar is extremely dangerous. Fortunately for the Smoke, she has a level head in a crisis and knows when to back off. Almost immediately during the Smoke&rsquo;s expedition, an unmapped lava bubble under the unstable terrain around Surt bursts. The Smoke&rsquo;s expedition, ironically, is overwhelmed by toxic gasses and choking ash, burning hot enough to singe even a fire elf.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Smoke is able to use her magic and wits to guide her pathfinders to a sheltered cave where they wait out the toxic storm for most of the season. With only a couple of weeks remaining once the storm has cleared, she decides to return to Surt to regroup rather than try to push forward. While the expedition was a failure, her leadership means that all the pathfinders returned unharmed. She stands by her decision.</p>
<p>Additionally, Smoke brings up her concern that the lava bubble she encountered could potentially be a serious threat. The terrain around Surt is extremely unstable, and only a surface level exploration of Surt was performed upon your initial founding. If another lava bubble like that were growing under Surt, you would currently have no way to tell. If it went off without warning, even if it was just close and not actually in the city, it could easily kill hundreds of people or force you to abandon the city entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>With all the drama, politics, and dire threats going on <em>someone</em> has to keep getting the <em>actual work done</em> and that someone, as always, is the CPC. While this season is a bit more relaxing for them (roads and festivals are frankly just less stressful than food shortages,) they do their civic duty with diligence and professionalism as always. They have viewed the (admittedly vague) terrain maps you have for the area around Surt, and come up with several viable plans for building roads that make navigating the treacherous Maar much less horrifically dangerous. Furthermore, they come up with a comprehensive plan for integrating this construction plan with already existing resources.</p>
<p><br />Surt has the terrain (not settlement) aspect <em>All Roads lead to Surt</em> and from now on, if you build a Settlement within 2 squares of Surt and there is a direct line of pathfound squares between the two, that settlement as well as the squares between will have the same Aspect. This will make traversing the terrain between settlements much less dangerous than the frequently fatal pathfinding expeditions in the area have found.</p>
<p><strong>The Hunger- </strong>The Hunger&rsquo;s research is leading him down some dark paths. Anything regarding souls is practically guaranteed to be madness. First of all, the Lycan scholar was a philosopher not a mage or alchemist. He may have been being hyperbolic. Second of all, as it is impossible to prove the existence of a discrete entity known as a &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; any source claiming to have direct evidence of them or know how to manipulate them is either full of shit or using flexible terminology. Hunger&rsquo;s research leads him to a lot of insane rambling and outright lies. Still, he persists...</p>
<p><em>Step One- </em>Off to a good start. The arcanoreactive substance you create greatly amplifies trace magical auras and causes them to persist for much longer. By applying this substance near himself - and because the lead sheeting neatly blocks out any interference from outside magic - Hunger is able to get an accurate sample of the magic aura created by both the transformation and the dog itself. These can be preserved for some time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he doesn&rsquo;t have anything to compare it to. Detect Magic simply gives the standard results it gives for any werecreatures. If he had a similar sample from the Tourist (or gods help him use detect magic on her while she is shifting) he might be able to compare his aura to hers, or that of a different werewolf, but that&rsquo;s a whole other game right there.</p>
<p><em>Step Two- </em>Given that this dreamdust poison is relatively inexpensive and the dreamdust elves are great about not asking too many questions, the Hunger goes all out. Every evening before the change, he is able to dose himself with the poison. It frequently takes more than one does for the desired effect, but he is able to eventually knock himself out.</p>
<p>He still isn&rsquo;t consistently able to remember what happens during a transformation, but he&rsquo;s a clever man. He places a silver-capped candle in his hand when he doses himself. The wolf inevitable throws it away when it wakes, causing it to go out. He can examine how long the candle was burning to see how long it took for it to rouse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems to rouse almost immediately on 3 of the 4 transformations he has this season. However on one, the candle was burned down significantly indicating that on at least one occasion the poison knocked it out for several hours.</p>
<p><em>Step Three-</em> This is a little more promising. This is back on the safe ground of actual demonstrable alchemical and arcane effects. Some people may call it souls, but the various planar energies coursing through a living being can all at least be categorized and measured.</p>
<p>Indeed, he even has an advantage. Among the notes he stole from his former &ldquo;master&rdquo; he finds a surprising amount of information on using mutagens to manipulate Lycanthropy. It appears to have been something of a pet project of hers. While the notes are mostly incomplete musings, he&rsquo;s able to get a solid standpoint.</p>
<p>His research indicates that indeed, it should be possible to use mutagens on the dog. In hybrid form, its physical body is not all that radically different than the Hunger himself on an alchemical level. Mutagens designed to affect him should affect it in roughly the same way.</p>
<p>The depilatory idea doesn&rsquo;t seem to work, but at any rate the theory behind using mutagens is sound.</p>
<p><br /><em>Step Four- </em>This turns out to be a complete bust. The terminology appears to be coincidental. The tumor familiar simply sloughs off a chunk of positive energy from the well that powers all living beings and uses it to power a little animal&hellip; tumor&hellip; construct...<em>thing.</em> Whatever the Lycan philosopher was talking about is on a much deeper level. If the Hunger indeed has a soul, the dog is melded with it as deeply as copper is in bronze.</p>
<p><em>Step Five-</em> The Hunger creates his alchemy garden quite handily. The grating and water protection are a good idea. It would be silly to drown in two inches of water after he&rsquo;s come so far. The guards - and honestly pretty much everyone - give the area a wide berth.</p>
<p>Better yet, planting the lilies is a success! Technically! They are quite hard to grow. He struggles getting the alchemical balance of the soil and water right and loses a few batches. Still, he eventually succeeds. Once. He has successfully grown only one flower, but has plenty of seeds left.</p>
