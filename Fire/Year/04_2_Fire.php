<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Event: The Hunger&rsquo;s Trial</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duration: Ongoing</strong></p>
<p>1 point of Morale stress per turn (starting end of Summer Year 4,) Praesidium cannot be invoked, Hunger under house arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Investment): Minty Fresh [Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p>Gold! GOLD! <strong>GOLD!</strong></p>
<p>The Firebirds have been screaming about gold for weeks. Weeks. Barry likes money as much as the next fop, but their obsession is starting to creep him out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And worse, they&rsquo;re getting frustrated. With the Hunger on lockdown, the plans for Surt&rsquo;s own mint and currency have been put on hold. Disr&rsquo;s gold is still flowing into the city, but most of it is being stockpiled, and the great merchants of Surt are still forced to rely on their stock of old Lycan coinage and limited scrip (or worse, <em>bartering</em>), and thus are subject to market fluctuations on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry isn&rsquo;t certain that &lsquo;market fluctuation&rsquo; is as big of a deal as his council insists, or even really what that <em>means</em>, but he understands intrinsically what frustration can do to an audience. So once again, he finds himself pressing things forward.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the CPC has already been working on this. All Barry has to do is lean on them, and then smooth their path a little bit, by settling disputes with the merchants about currency value (something about &lsquo;fixing it to match the minimum magical exchange value&rsquo;? Pfft, whatever), determining the percentage of gold in each coin, and setting the faces and symbols on the coin (just going to slap the symbol of the Phoenix Imperialis on one side, with <em>Fiat Lux</em> underneath, and the Fury&rsquo;s mask on the other side, above the phrase <em>Caveat Emptor </em>[Editor&rsquo;s note: due to a mistake in production, the phrase <em>Caveat Emptor</em> was replaced on the blueprints with <em>Alea Jacta Est</em>, from a brochure describing the manufacturing process]).</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Get On With It [the Terror]</p>
<p>The Terror is tired of this. Tired, frustrated, and honestly, still pretty angry. Angry at the Hunger for hiding his affliction. Angry at the Wolf Elves for actively afflicting her citizens. Angry at the Praesidium for wasting time and energy when there&rsquo;s a clear problem elsewhere, and not resolving the question of &ldquo;is the Hunger an afflicted werewolf&rdquo; in three whole full moons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time to end this.</p>
<p>First, Tsun needs to understand more of this situation. Too much of this battleplan forces dependence of operation, and Tsun is an independent operator even when she&rsquo;s cooperating. To that end, the Terror orders Tsun to report for a debriefing, and then manually walks with her to the Hunger&rsquo;s villa, for a need-to-know-only meeting (she can even bring guards if she&rsquo;s concerned, but they must wait outside). She then tells Tsun (with the Hunger&rsquo;s help) that they&rsquo;re aware of a group of Lycans outside of the Elven settlements that are deliberately afflicting refugees for use as agents and &lsquo;agents of chaos&rsquo;. The Hunger&rsquo;s absences have been part of his research into their activities, and attempt to protect Surt against them.</p>
<p>Tsun is ordered to keep this quiet, but the Hunger (and even Terror, who is quiet and specific as always) tries to explain their reasoning -- that the Lycans have likely been spying on Surt via disappearing infected refugees for some time, and will likely push their plans forward if Surt is generally alerted to them. Tsun is asked to instead focus the Praesidium&rsquo;s efforts on checking on the incoming refugees, and testing them for the affliction; any afflicted are to be quietly questioned with either the Terror or the Hunger present (though neither are too concerned if she questions some of them without asking).</p>
<p>Step two is simple and blunt. The Terror will wait for the next session of the Hunger&rsquo;s trial, and quite bluntly tell them to <em>get on with it</em>. Her position is that it does not take six months to determine if someone is afflicted; put the Hunger out under the full moon -- keep him out there, monitored and protected, for a week on both sides of the full moon if necessary -- and be done with it. To do otherwise is a waste of time trying to prove crimes that don&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p>To help resolve both as cleanly as possible, the Terror motivates the aspect <em>Birth Pyre</em> for the cost of <strong>1 fate point</strong>, to reflect her straightforward and blunt arguments (in both cases). Surt must resolve this quickly and decisively, and instead spend its efforts on the battle to come.</p>

<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Reconnaissance (Rangers): Run Spot Run [the Smoke]</p>
<p>Finally! An assignment that doesn&rsquo;t involve building something!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its been literally years since the Smoke has gotten a chance to take the field. Now, finally, she gets a shot at doing something she enjoys -- scouting! Roughing it! Living it up in the field! Tracking sneaky ruffians scampering across Surtian territory! Coordinating with strange allies from distant lands (well, lands more than a hundred miles away, at least)!</p>
<p>Now, if only something could be done about all the cacti, and crazy grasses, and enormous fuck-off ants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Smoke deploys her scouts in [one square] along the river far to Surt&rsquo;s south (directly south). She doesn&rsquo;t expect to find anyone on the first round, but following the river would be a pretty logical path for anyone moving through the area (particularly if they aren&rsquo;t well adapted to the Marr&rsquo;s eccentricities), and she might be able to find a crossing point or evidence of regular travel if she&rsquo;s careful.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=8ad6f0dddb348010e7a0a08a4896195d">Roll</a>: Yep, nada</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): Fur Affinity [the Fury]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fury! Work on something you hate! Being miserable builds character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Okay, so&hellip; Wolf Elves. Thanks to the Potluck, the Fury now has the plans for a &lsquo;modified&rsquo; version of the dreaded Attempt to Harm ritual, with the whole &ldquo;who wants to harm us&rdquo; segment replaced pretty much entirely with &ldquo;is a Wolf Elf&rdquo;. This&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t exactly what the ritual was intended for, and is honestly something of a hodgepodge between the original ritual and several crazy hyper-specific defense plans put together by the Dark Elves, but all the same, the Wolf Elves are clearly stepping up their game, and Fury knows she has to step up hers in return.</p>
<p>This should be a simpler implementation than she&rsquo;s tried previously. No more of this whole &ldquo;modify this thing to make sense&rdquo;; now, it's just going to be a simple &ldquo;Find Wolf Elf, make alert noise&rdquo; scanner. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to last longer than usual -- it can work as a sporadic defense. All they really need is deterrence. Furthermore, it doesn&rsquo;t even need to look for a specific attitude or behavior; if there are Wolf Elves in the city, it's probably worth knowing that they&rsquo;re there, and even if they&rsquo;re not plotting anything sinister, they should probably be interviewed.</p>
<p>She considers implementing some fancy gold leafwork throughout the city if it looks like that will help beef up the spell a bit. Maybe extended a bit with some other metal, so that the city isn&rsquo;t reliant on a bunch of very expensive and easily resold chunks of Solid Money in order to support its esoteric defenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=e1b93451db748010e7a0a08a4896196f">Roll</a>: 0 anything</p>
<p>&ldquo;Augh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<h3>Fall Year 4 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>Barrabus' expertise was always in <em>spending </em>huge chunks of coin rather than <em>making </em>it, so he's a bit bewildered by some of the terms that fly around during this process. Things like "price fixing," "commodity currency," "deadweight loss," and maybe something like "artificial scarcity," but certainly none of these are red flags and everything is totally fine. The huge amount of shiny new GP he ends up stacked with does a lot to assuage any concerns he might have. Better yet, that first run of incorrectly minted coins become something of collector's items. Barry might have some actual cash flow here. Nice!</p>
<p>Fiduciary shenanigans aside, Surt now has the Aspect <em>Fresh Mint</em>. The Mint isn't a huge affair and is pretty basic as far as currency creation goes, but it's enough to turn Disr's gold into a steady flow of minted coins. The introduction of currency is no small thing, and does a lot to cement Surt as an actual power. Nothing like having some coins with your face on them to say "Hey, I'm officially more important than you."</p>
<p>In addition, the Phoenix Imperialis seem to want their Phoenix Lord to look the part. Barrabus gets a huge chunk of cash as payment for the role in the ascendancy of the party, as well as a rather ostentatious villa that's great for showing off to fancy dignitaries. It also has an excellent wine cellar.</p>
<p>The Imperialis also open some of their precious rare stores of magic items to Barrabus. Apparently with the recent assassination attempt and violent monsters and whatnot, they want to give him what he needs to not die.</p>
<p>Barrabus gains enough GP to bring him up to wealth by level, which he may spend within reason on magic items.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>There's a time for sly and manipulative politics, and a time to slam your proverbial private parts down on the table and yell "everyone shut the fuck up, it's time to get things done."</p>
<p>Terror's rather <em>direct</em> method of solving problems in politics usually causes more problems than it solves, but like a <a href="https://youtu.be/6DEdq2WdFnU">sledgehammer in an orchestra</a> it's very occasionally just the tool you need.</p>
<p>In this case, even Tsun can't wriggle her way out of her responsibilities with the Terror's gaze literally burning into her.</p>
<p>You can't say the meeting with Tsun goes <em>well, </em>per se, but it does go <em>somewhere</em>. Tsun is convinced that the talk of a whole separate Lycan faction is just a distraction, something to throw off the Praesidium and keep her neatly bottled up and out of the Triumvirate's way.</p>
<p>However, with her experience finding the afflicted last season, she admits that something is definitely off. Even if she's not convinced that it's not the Hunger, <em>some</em>one deliberately afflicted that poor bastard.</p>
<p>Reluctantly (and with some looming from Terror) Tsun agrees to place the asked for attentions into looking for incoming afflicted. She does agree that any afflicted detected will be brought to the Triumvirate if caught alive, but is adamant that the Praesidium gets first crack at them if they deem it necessary.</p>
<p>Tsun is still adversarial and focusing on the wrong enemies, but at least now she has agreed to let the Praesidium do its job.</p>
<p>There's also not a lot she can do about the trial, either. Even ranking members of the Praesidium feel she's reaching and dragging things out. The trial was supposed to be about whether or not he's afflicted, not whether he did anything wrong <em>ever.</em> The Praesidium bucks Tsun's veto for the first time, allowing the demonstration to take place. They even provide a slew of alchemical and magical tests to prove that he isn't somehow suppressing or faking being normal. They then do it again three nights in a row, under clear skies and a full moon.</p>
<p>Tsun is <em>still</em> snapping mad and convinced that Hunger is hiding something, but she does not have the evidence to pursue it. She'll have to come up with another plan of attack if she wants to dislodge Hunger.</p>
<p><strong>Event: </strong>Hunger's Trial</p>
<p><strong>Status: </strong>Resolved</p>
<p>Hunger is off house arrest and things are mostly back to normal. You still took the stress damage this turn, but it will begin healing next turn.</p>
<p>There are still a ton of unanswered questions regarding the information gathered during the trial, but Hunger is no longer an official suspect and can <em>finally </em>get back to doing his <em>fucking job</em>.</p>
<p>Oh and speaking of which...</p>
<p><strong>One other small thing: </strong>Once he&rsquo;s politely reinstated, Hunger realizes that his contacts in the Praesidium are forwarding him copies of Praesidium incident reports on the down low. They aren&rsquo;t giving him anything that he couldn&rsquo;t get by asking directly, but it both goes under Tsun&rsquo;s nose and prevents him from having to talk to her, so hey that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Oh what the&hellip;</p>
<p>Apparently, while he was on trial, a group of <em>crag elves</em>, strange mysterious crag elves, wandered into Surt and starting asking people random questions about the fire elves in general. Just&hellip; the most enigmatic and insular elven group short of the cryptid elves wandered in and started talking to random people. They were at the Howl for <em>days</em> asking questions!</p>
<p>A Praesidium patrol intercepted them at the gate and briefly interrogated them. Apparently, they seemed harmless enough. Harmless. Enough. Exact words. The understaffed Praesidium kept an eye on them while they were in Surt, then let them leave when they had apparently asked their fill of weird questions. The Praesidium at least kept them away from sensitive locations and personnel.</p>
<p>Of course, the Praesidium didn&rsquo;t record exactly who they were talking to, much less what they asked. Now no one has any idea who they were or why they were really here. Nor did the Praesidium think it necessary to immediately inform the Triumvirate about the <em>mysterious foreign dignitaries entering</em> <em>town</em>, so now you have nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait, maybe not.</p>
<p>According to the report, they spent a lot of time at the Howl talking to patrons. If they were in the Howl for more than three minutes, they probably talked to Barry at some point.</p>
<p>Which means now Hunger has to talk to Barry. Great.</p>
<p>Harmless&hellip; Enough&hellip; <em>really?</em></p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> Vita is beginning to believe her ancestors may have angered some kind of deity of violent storms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been months, no, <em>years</em> of mostly calm weather, and the <em>second</em> she sets out on an expedition to get some pathfinding done, <em>boom</em> dust storm. Seriously, clear day, out of nowhere, and that shit rolls in like a godsdamn angry cloud and just <em>sits there</em>. She had even been expecting some kind of bullshit! She set <em>reasonable goals! She didn&rsquo;t want to overextend! And then this bullshit happens!</em></p>
<p>This, along with many other tirades and strings of colorful language, is what the other pathfinders experience for several weeks as they are trapped in their tents while massive dust storms rip through their camp. Even the normally cheerful and positive Vita is compromised by the situation. Things are looking grim and frustrating and wait, is someone trying to&hellip; knock on a tent flap?</p>
<p>By sheer random chance, a group of winged elf rangers led by Dhakamari has ended up in the same territory as Vita. They, too, have been laid low by the horrendous dust storms and forced to abandon their planned scouting route. They take cover for a couple weeks, providing some camaraderie that lifts the pathfinders spirits a bit. It also helps Vita&rsquo;s ego a bit that one of the most skilled rangers on the continent was trapped by the same storm.</p>
<p>And&hellip; continue to be trapped. Shit. The storms rage on for days on end. They get so bad that it seems dark even during the daytime. It's impossible even for the winged elves to forage. The dust is so aggressive that the rangers have to dig sand daily to keep the camp from being outright buried. Supplies, food, and morale start to run low.</p>
<p>That's when <em>another </em>statistically improbable encounter happens. An older river elf named Prosalirus who speaks in absolutely impeccably perfect elven and with an accentless voice enters the camp. He is with a flotilla that happens to be passing through. He saw their stricken camp and offered his aid, even a ride with the flotilla to safety if necessary.</p>
<p>After some discussion, Vita and Dhakamari decide to continue to ride it out. They have objectives to achieve. The flotilla, of course, has food and supplies aplenty. They happily give the beleaguered rangers spare rations and supplies before heading out. It's enough to get the teams through the remaining weeks of storms.</p>
<p>Curiously, now that you think about it, Prosalirus never said <em>what</em> flotilla he was part of...</p>
<p>There are only a couple weeks left for scouting when the storms clear up. With the winged elves&rsquo; help, they at least are able to finish scouting the targeted area and report back that they have found no signs of current enemy activity.</p>
<p>A few smaller things found: Apparently the river elves have named this river the Marraine. There are signs that a flotilla has passed. There are also signs that the afflicted horde that the river elves fought moved through here, headed east.</p>
<p>No wolf elves at least. Small blessings.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>The Fury has gone past frustrated and has landed in straight up depressed.</p>
<p>She set her sights at a very reasonable level this time. She didn&rsquo;t attempt to improve the ritual she had been given at all. Hells, she tried to make it <em>simpler</em>, and yet for some reason she just&hellip; can&rsquo;t&hellip; get it to work!</p>
<p>Honestly it&rsquo;s probably something small. Some small detail she&rsquo;s missing that is preventing things from coming together. She just plain can&rsquo;t figure out <em>what</em> though, and she feels like wolf elves are staring at her from every corner and giggling at her incompetence. Finding out that fucking <em>Cantia</em> survived of all people, and now Tsun chased off Katya&hellip; Tourist&hellip; wolf lady, who had actually been making her feel <em>safer</em> but fucking <em>Tsun</em> had to fuck that up, and she drank <em>ghoul booze, </em>and <em>Hunger still hasn&rsquo;t fucking apologized for hiding the fact that he was a werewolf for over two years. </em>She&rsquo;s even been having nightmares about Governor Fuckface giving her that patronizing smile, the bastard doesn&rsquo;t even say anything just <em>ugh</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when she wakes up from one of those nightmares after having apparently shot off a fireball in a hypnagogic jerk that she realizes that she may be overly stressed out. As the burning cinders of her meager research flutter around her lab like so much snow she collapses on her desk sobbing. Whatever she had on that ritual is now gone.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, something occurs to her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s alone in here.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s <em>always </em>alone in here.</p>
<p>She has no one else to bounce questions off of, or help double check her work, or just come up with ideas. Her ritual team helps cast, but they all look to her for actually developing and leading the rituals. She&rsquo;s doing all this on her own, and maybe it&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;s not a miserable failure idiot girl. Maybe she just&hellip; needs help.</p>
<p><strong>Misc: </strong>A letter is delivered by a winged elf who is, somewhat shockingly, wearing a uniform. The letter informs your leaders that the winged elves have turned their informal system of messengers into an actual formal post system, with set postage fees, schedules, delivery timeframes, postage codes, and stamps. Ooh, stamps! The letter gives you all the information you need to set up a post office in one of your settlements, allowing the regular transport of post and parcels between you and allied elven settlements.</p>
<p>As the new office takes shape (assuming you permit it,) a basket labeled 'feather letters' appears on the counter. The messengers inform you that these are from residents of other cities to no one in particular, and that anyone can take one from the basket and answer it, and maybe strike up a friendship. 'Like a message in a bottle', they said. 'Seeing where it lands'.</p>
<p>The Winged Elves have created a <em>Winged Mail</em> Civilization Aspect. Since this is just as helpful for allies to have access to as themselves, they have decided to give you access to this Aspect. You may Invoke it for anything involving long range trade or communication, same as if it was one of your own Aspects. Nice!</p>
<p><em>Note: You don't have to do anything to be able to use this Aspect. The post office can be made by the Winged Post purchasing a small building for their own use. You do not have to create an Aspect for it</em>.</p>
