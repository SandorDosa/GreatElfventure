<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly enough, Fire Elves ain&rsquo;t got no problems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Enrichment): Mountain Turnpike [the Hunger]</p>
<p>The CPC has a new goal for this season -- road extensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its no secret that the Hunger plans on building another Surtian village before the end of the year, but with the lingering threat of Coyote raids, any construction that takes place will have to leave the village in a secure, defensible position that can be easily reinforced by local troops. To that end, the CPC is commissioned to design and order roadworks heading into the mountains to the Northwest, past the massive lava-lake that is reportedly <a href="https://greatelfventure.azurewebsites.net/Fire/Bonus/25_Dragons in the Mist.php">a popular bathing spot with local dragons</a>.</p>
<p>The endpoint of the road is kept a little more vague, to allow the designers leeway when village construction begins (and to allow for any large-scale fortification that comes with it).</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: All Roads Lead to Surt extended to 3+ pathfound squares</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=aa2e178ddb7f3300e7a0a08a489619f2">Roll</a>: 5 advantage, 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Renewed Vigor [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>Flush from her partial political victories, Tsun turns her attention back to spycraft and civil defense, to help cement the Praesidium as a serious civil authority. For starters, that means actual uniforms -- courtesy of her new merchant backers. Next, however, is a serious examination of Surt&rsquo;s espionage defenses, and a surge in examinations of newcomers entering the city. There was an assassination attempt at a rally being run by the Praesidium, after all, and the nature of the target paints the Praesidium&rsquo;s inability to catch the assassin beforehand as either incompetent&hellip; or suspicious.</p>
<p>Time to lay those rumors to rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=47859741db7f3300e7a0a08a48961979">Roll</a>: 1 advantage, 2 successes</p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Drill): Horse Power [Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p><em>Includes upgrade for Flashpoint (Summer Year 3)</em></p>
<p><em>Includes bonus die for Wargames (Fall Year 3)</em></p>
<p><em>Spending Copper Shipment for 1 Prof die (Fall Year 3)</em></p>
<p>The Phoenix Imperialis wanted a proud, flashy military unit of their own. And Barrabus will give them one.</p>
<p>First, he runs a consult with Surt&rsquo;s few retired cavalrymen from before the war, as well as some of the attendees from the Terror&rsquo;s wargames last season. The goal: to codify the logistics and skills needed to form a proper cavalry unit, and instructions on how to train new cavalrymen and their associated support staff. With this, he also works to come up with an appropriate cavalry &lsquo;design&rsquo; -- the skills and training this new unit will need in order to serve as a heavy anti-cavalry unit against the lightning-fast Cazadore-style raiding cavalry style. Barry&rsquo;s goal is not to copy or mimic their style, but rather to counter it, or at least provide a style that can go against it and still perform other cavalry actions.</p>
<p>Second is the training. With the PI&rsquo;s massive stockpile of funds available, Barry coordinates with the Council of Six to purchase an appropriate area of land to serve as a training facility. Surt&rsquo;s barracks are perfectly appropriate for training infantry, but a bit too small for the fast Cazadore horses brought up from the South. The Council make plans to convert it into a sporting arena after the training is complete -- with some designs that should allow it to be converted back, should the need arise.</p>
<p>Third is their equipment. With the PI&rsquo;s help, Barry immediately seizes the new copper shipment, and then buys up the local tin reserves, and brings the entirety of both to Imperialis-friendly smiths and workshops. The smiths are instructed to make top-quality armor -- flashy, but extremely functional -- for the riders, and build similar-styled parade barding to match.</p>
<p>The Hunger is furious, but&hellip; accepting. That massive bounty of copper could have made a huge difference to the city&rsquo;s long term development goals, but the city *isn&rsquo;t* going to develop if the Coyotes continue to be a problem. He makes plans to acquire a new supply of copper&hellip; and to keep an eye on the Phoenix Imperialis.</p>
<p>If the unit can be trained up in time, Barry plans to place them with Charred Eagles. It only makes sense that they&rsquo;d be with the most elite of the nation&rsquo;s troops, right?</p>
<p><strong>Unit created: Fire Elf Chevaliers</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Division: Charred Eagles</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=08fa95a3db233300e7a0a08a48961986">Roll</a>: 4 advantage, 4 successes</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Magic): Greasebubble [the Fury]</p>
<p>If at first you don&rsquo;t succeed, doggedly keep trying because you don&rsquo;t really know any other options.</p>
<p>The Fury organizes her staff for another under-Surt scan attempt. Knowing now that the lava flow&rsquo;s resident was, in fact, a visiting dragon, the Fury decides to make a few changes to the ritual plan. There&rsquo;s less need to scan for large open areas or potential air bubbles; instead, they just need a complete, solid map of the localized area, with the expectation that a lot of it may be coming from very, very deep (even for magma).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=934da285db3f3300e7a0a08a4896198e">Roll</a>: 2 advantage, 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Character Actions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action:</strong></p>
<p>Its clear to the Hunger that he now has at least *some* innate control over the change to &lsquo;dog mode&rsquo; -- after all, the dog is capable of triggering it independently of the moon, and he was capable of resisting that change. So time for experimentation.</p>
<p>Starting three days before the new moon each month, and ending three days after, the Hunger attempts to &ldquo;manually&rdquo; change -- locking himself in his lab, of course, and carefully releasing it if there is any evidence that he might be losing control.</p>
<p>Predictable. Not the answer he&rsquo;d preferred -- and he&rsquo;ll admit, not the answer he had begun to <em>assume</em>, but predictable.</p>
<p>Assume. From its root of sumo, meaning &ldquo;to take&rdquo;. How fitting. He&rsquo;d taken the dog&rsquo;s arguments and actions more seriously than he should have, and now the dog would take his life.</p>
<p>But there is little point hindsight, now. He always knew this was always a risk -- even before the Tourist&rsquo;s bite, that fateful day in the Agora. What matters more is setting the stage for Surt&rsquo;s survival, and for whatever successor might take his place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whether or not the dog agrees with the need, he effectively has some &ldquo;say&rdquo; on the Hunger&rsquo;s choice, as long as he has the power to fight for control. And monitoring for his influence is extremely taxing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hunger takes a bit of time to go through his civics notes, checking for &ldquo;changes&rdquo; left behind by his passenger, and then carefully moves them into his office, in a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; set of drawers that could generally be found by anyone giving the room a very thorough search. That way, even if his lab is not discovered for some time, his civil planning mechanisms will still be retained. His experiment notes can be left in the lab, in a stone chest half-filled with salt; that way, even if he vanished tomorrow and the room itself was left undisturbed for a thousand years, something would still be retained.</p>
<p>Next is some careful cleaning of all lab equipment that may have been exposed to his bodily fluids. He doubts the dog will care to interfere with this; after all, he has no interest in generating extra afflicted, either.</p>
<p><strong>Dogtalk:</strong></p>

<p id="HungerLetter">When did you first &ldquo;awaken&rdquo;? Right after we were bitten? A month afterward? On our first change?</p>

<p id="DogLetter">I am still you, my memory only differs slightly. I can remember our first transformation, and the night of it, but it was hardly more than base instinct. It was only over time that I became this personality we call the &lsquo;dog,&rsquo; and honestly I am not sure what it says about our mental stability. I suppose I &ldquo;awakened&rdquo; when you first communicated with me. I only became as aware as I am, and as much you as I am, over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That morning, reading over the dog&rsquo;s notes from the night, the Hunger paused. He set down the notes, stepped out to his desk, and wrote a quick message to his aides -- informing them that he was feeling ill and would be staying in bed for the day. Then he closed the door, and set the <em>Arcane Lock</em> again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>So by that logic</em>, he thought at himself, <em>you only exist as a direct result of my inquiry. By attempting to communicate with the curse itself, I have created you -- a part of me that wants to prove itself an asset, but is inherently a liability due to its tie to the curse.</em></p>
<p><em>We both know exactly why trusting you is so difficult. You control the curse, and therefore not only the change that threatens my career and the future of my people, but also a physical transformation that turns most of its victims into uncontrolled murderous barbarians, as far from civilization as one can get.</em></p>
<p><em>But by giving you an intelligence, I have changed the curse -- given it a sentient mind that *can* control it. That *can* consent to not charging around the room, wrecking every pretext of civilized life it can reach.</em></p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a part of me that, with this knowledge, wants to kill you. Here and now. And the rest of me if necessary. We both know this.</em></p>
<p><em>But neither of us have ever been one to give up.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>So today, instead of digging for an impossible cure, or arguing over future plans, or plotting against each other, let&rsquo;s try the one thing that we know has worked. Let&rsquo;s try to change *the curse* again.</em></p>
<p><em>If we could control it by giving it your mind, could we wipe it away entirely? Or at least bury it so deep it can never be physically detected.</em></p>
<p><em>We have another twenty-four hours. Let&rsquo;s try, shall we?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> replies the dog, <em>&nbsp;<a href="https://greatelfventure.azurewebsites.net/Fire/Bonus/24_Give me Domestication.php">We shall.</a></em></p>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<h3>Winter Year 3 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>The end is near for the Hunger. He can feel it in a way that he cannot explain. Instead of fear or dread, he feels&hellip; accomplished. At peace with it, even. Perhaps, to some degree, proud.</p>
<p>This season, the Hunger hardly needs to give the CPC any guidance at all. They are essentially completely functional without him. They are able to complete the road expansion project with complete professionalism and skill. Whatever else happens, the CPC will continue to thrive after he is gone. Not glorious or legendary, but exactly what Surt needs to survive.</p>
<p>The CPC once again exceeds all expectations. Not only are they able to complete the roads project, they do so with such efficiency that they are able to draft plans for expanding the fortified roadways. By working the roads into the defensive plans of the cities themselves, they are able to make the roads through the Maar truly safe to travel. Not just Surt, but all fire elf territory will be protected.</p>
<p>Not only do they succeed at improving <em>All Roads Lead to Surt </em>as projected, but they are also able to improve the <em>Fortified Roadways</em> Aspect so that it will now apply to any settlement connected to Surt by road that also has its own defensive fortifications, which currently includes Gedr.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Things are never quiet in Surt. It&rsquo;s a damned good thing Barrabus was able to calm the waters, as there is a major security breach in the palace itself. Midway through the season, during a full moon, guards in the palace detected an intruder snooping in some of the most secure areas. The guards attempted to flush out the spy, but were struck by several vials of a liquid that the Hunger is later able to identify as an enhanced version of Liquid Ice that freezes their feet to the floor.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>for once</em>, Tsun and the Praesidium have done something right. Advanced warning makes it out of the palace, and a nearby group of Praesidium are able to scramble a patrol, and also do so with correct information. Knowing that the spy is likely not a fire elf, they respond with a trap consisting of a few low level fire spells and alchemists&rsquo; fire. They corner the spy and attempt to dogpile him while he&rsquo;s trapped by the flames.</p>
<p>The spy appears to have been prepared for such an eventuality, but only partially. While the spy appears to have warded himself against fire, he did not ward any of his gear. He is not able to respond with alchemical weapons, and much of his gear is burned away in the flames. As he caught fire, a Praesidium officer was able to snatch a satchel off his arm and rip it away from him. The spy was able to wriggle free from the dogpile and escape.</p>
<p>The Praesidium report is surprisingly professional, for once. It mentions that the spy was disguised as a Coyote, but was definitely not a Coyote. M.O. Use of exotic alchemical weapons and disguises suggests the wolf elves, but that can&rsquo;t be confirmed as any evidence of that was burned away by the fire.</p>
<p>Also thankfully, the patrol returns the satchel to the Triumvirate without incident. There is some frustration that the Hunger is once again unable to be contacted during this event, but it&rsquo;s much less of an issue than last time. Fury is up, and manages to smooth things over before putting the satchel in his office and going back to bed.</p>
<p>And boy oh boy howdy is it a good thing no one checked in that satchel because the spy had somehow managed to access the Hunger&rsquo;s lab, defeating both the conventional and arcane locks. Thank whatever gods were watching that this happened <em>after</em> the Hunger&rsquo;s confrontation with the Dog and that he was sealed in the containment cell instead of loose in the lab. The spy had attempted to steal much of the Hunger&rsquo;s secret notes about his battle with the affliction, and that was much of what was stored in the satchel.</p>
<p>This was the closest the Hunger has come. If any one of those Praesidium members had decided to look in the satchel, or if the Fury had been a bit more curious or a bit more tired, then that would have been the end of it right there, and in a far messier way than he was intending. Worse, the dog might have gotten free.</p>
<p>This, of course, leaves Hunger with one remaining question: Did the spy read those notes in detail before he lost them?</p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> Holy shit, Barrabus is actually <em>good</em> at this! The Chevaliers are a resounding success, and better yet done entirely with fire elf resource management, no need for blade elf intervention or the Academy. The Imperialis weren&rsquo;t trying to spurn the blade elves or anything, but have successfully proven that the blades aren&rsquo;t the only ones who can produce badasses.</p>
<p>Speaking of, the time seems to have been right for cavalry. This is not an inexperienced unit. In fact, nearly all of the soldiers recruited were veteran blade elf Hussars before the conflagration. The Imperialis put out a call among the fire elves, promising enhanced connections, wealth, and status. Many merchants and social elites answered the call, coming out of retirement to serve in the unique unit. While this unit skews a bit towards middle aged, the amount of both experience and wealth shows in the unit&rsquo;s skill and equipment.</p>
<p>The money goes into the logistics needed to supply such a unit. Not only the training grounds, but Vaquero consultants eager for jobs. The training grounds could even eventually come to be an academy of their own. The chevaliers are absolutely the best the fire elves have to offer, equal to the Elect in terms of skill and valor.</p>
<p>They arrive in Riverhaven with armor gleaming, ready and willing to commit to her defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>Magic is hard. Fury&rsquo;s morale has taken a bit of a hit this season as the ritual once again doesn&rsquo;t go quite right. Still, she is learning. Indeed, she makes some progress. She is unable to get a complete scan, but is able to get some small details from her casting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reading through the ley lines is difficult. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing most of the issue. She manages to get some information through, however. Indeed there is lava under Surt, though how much and how deep she&rsquo;s not sure. At the very least, the limited data she gathers indicate that it&rsquo;s stable for the time being. She is able to at least rule out a lava bubble immediately under Surt.</p>
<p><br />While the ritual has not succeeded, progress has been made. She will get a <strong>boost die</strong> on her next casting of Deep Scan.</p>
<p><strong>Hunger- </strong>The end is nigh, but Hunger is far from finished. The dog is fighting him harder than ever, but on the other side of the coin the Hunger is possessed of a clarity he has never had before. Dying gives you that kind of vision.</p>
<p>Hunger is able to control the dog, for now. Surprisingly, the Hunger&rsquo;s newfound conviction to fight until the bitter end has created more divisions in his mind. It has become harder for the dog to access his memories and knowledge, as well as vice versa. Hiding things from the dog is becoming more possible, as is containing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dog, however, fights at every turn. It is actively working against him now, a point that it makes late in the season:</p>
<p><em>I know what you&rsquo;re trying to do,</em> it tells him, <em>and I won&rsquo;t let you succeed. We will make Surt ascendant, and I will see that to fruition whether you come with me or not.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Bring it, fuzzball.</p>
<p>Then things get worse.</p>
<p>On the last day of the season, the Hunger receives a package from a fake address. Inside the carefully wrapped protective case is a thick packet of parchment. The many pages are covered in dense alchemical formulae. It appears to be instructions for an incredibly powerful concoction that even the Hunger won't be able to decipher the purpose of without weeks of work&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if he didn't recognize the brilliant-but-batshit-insane style of alchemy used by its author, the sheer mastery of the science would easily confirm who wrote this. There's simply no one else who could create something on this level of both genius and madness.</p>
<p>Inside the package is a letter, written in a sharp and night unintelligible handwriting that is quite familiar to him.</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">I hear you're in some trouble.</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">I have to say, I'm a little disappointed in you.</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">You've come so far, but keep making the same mistakes.</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">You keep sabotaging yourself just before triumph.</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">Still, I would loath to see your potential wasted in such a pointlessly sanctimonious display, so I suppose I can allow you to copy my work one last time.</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">Just never forget the most important lesson I ever taught you:<</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">There is always a way out.</p>
<p id="CantiaLetter">Good luck Apprentice.</p>
