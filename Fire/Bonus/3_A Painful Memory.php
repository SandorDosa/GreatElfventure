<p>Fury took a deep breath and stepped into the room. The terrifying cryptid was hunched over a desk, performing some kind of magic on the copper feather. Fury steadied herself to ask a question she could not leave alone.</p>
<p>“Could you teach me how your magic works?”</p>
<p>“Why?" Ink does not turn away from his work.</p>
<p>"I need to know why the transformation happened. I'm hoping that if I know more about esoteric magics, I might find out more about why we changed."</p>
<p>That answer makes him set down the feather and think for a minute, actually turning towards her.</p>
<p>“Why?” He blinked. “Sorry. What would you do?”</p>
<p>"...I'm not sure. It's too late to go back. I just feel as if I need to know why we changed. And maybe that'll say something about where we need to go from here.”</p>
<p>He considered that for several minutes, and then began to speak, slowly and carefully. “Teaching you my magic would put us in danger. Not because of you. ...I can teach you other things.”</p>
<p>“What sort of… Oh, screw it. I’ll take you up on that. This last year has proven I can’t afford to be picky.”</p>
<p>He gave her a quizzical look. “Divination.”</p>
<p>“...I could afford to learn some divination. Or at least a refresher course.”</p>
<p>“As you wish. One divination spell, of the fifth level or lower. You may use it once. I will be watching to see how you use it. I will see what you see.”</p>
<p>"...Umm... Okay. Think I can handle that. Umm. It's got to be a spell I can cast, right? Because I'm not that powerful of a mage yet.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “It has to be a spell I can cast.”</p>
<p>"Then I've got one in mind. Akashic Communion. It's a rare spell, but a powerful one, and it might give me a chance to... yes. That one. If you have it."</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>Ink touches the tattoo on his chest. It spins and opens into a wide black mark. He reaches into his chest, his arm disappearing up to the elbow in darkness, and retrieves a set of masterwork tattoo tools made of copper.</p>
<p>The Fury blanches.</p>
<p>“I will inscribe the tattoo wherever you wish.”</p>
<p>“The… the arm will be fine, thank you.”</p>
<p>“It’s yours.”</p>
<p>It appears to be a stylized version of her mask, surrounded by geometric patterns that move if you stare at them too long. The tattoo is of stunning beauty, as much a masterwork of art as any she has ever seen. Examining it closely, she can see the conditional scry that will let him see when she uses the spell.</p>
<p>“...Well, I can’t really ask for a better deal.”</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Everything was ready, except for her.</p>
<p>Every resource she could beg borrow, or steal. Every book, every record, every single scrap of singed paper that survived the conflagration that the Fury could possibly get her hands on was there. The night was perfect, not only the height of the full moon but a perfectly clear unusually warm night. Exactly like the night of the conflagration. There would never be a better time to do this.</p>
<p>The Fury was hesitating. A small silver mirror, a few candles lit. Nestled in a fortress of books and papers. It didn’t seem right. Ink hadn't given any kind of specific instructions at all. Was it really this easy?</p>
<p>She placed her hands on the floor on either side of the small silver mirror. She could see her masked face perfectly in reflection.</p>
<p><i>I'm ready to do this.</i></p>
<p>She took a slow breath.</p>
<p><i><b>I am ready to do this.</b></i></p>
<p>She felt a tingling sensation in her arm. As she turned her head to look at the tattoo, it became a crawling, burning pain.</p>
<p>The tattoo was moving. She could see the geometric designs around the image of her mask turning and twisting, spreading and expanding down her arm. She felt the stomach churning sensation of the ink sliding under her skin, and then a flash of pain as the eyes on the tattooed mask flared gold. She hissed in pain and turned back to the mirror. She saw her eyes flare the same color.</p>
<p>The creeping pain of the tattoo slithered up her arm, her neck, and towards her face. She shuddered at the sensation.</p>
<p><i>I can do this</i>, she steadied herself and gazed into the mirror, <i>I have to do this</i>.</p>
<p>She watched the black tattoos spread along her face, then into the corners of her vision. She watched the black lines slowly spread until all she could see was her mask and the golden circles of her eyes.</p>
<p>She felt the sensation of falling - away from her body, away from her very consciousness. The light from her mask grew blinding. She drew her self, her very being, inwards and asserted her identity to herself.</p>
<p>Billions of other minds tore at her, prying fingers into her mind looking for a way inside. She did not let them. She was the <i>Fury</i>, and she would not fail this time.</p>
<p>The light shattered into infinity. The Fury could not fully comprehend what she saw. A starfield of infinite points of light, scattered across infinite space and time. Each one called to her, promising mysterious power.</p>
<p><i>I am here for a reason.</i></p>
<p>The Fury ignored them all, except for one. The one ringing with truth and agony to her. A single point of light filled her view. It was the one. She extended her mind and entered it.</p>
<p>The ritual is ready. Finally, all the right pieces are in place. You finish the final marking of the circle and stand to survey your work.</p>
<p>The circle was perfect. Every rune and containment complete. In the center, the Phoenix. Hard to tell from the look of the ragged dying fledgeling bound to a pedestal by mithral chain, but the ancient creature is older than some gods.</p>
<p><i>Not for long</i>, you smile to yourself.</p>
<p>At the other end of the circle, the girl. Clad in a sheer white silk robe, she is beautiful. Young and vibrant, full of life in so many ways.</p>
<p>What a waste.</p>
<p>"Master?" The girl asks softly "Is it ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes my dear," you give her a kind smile, "This will be it. After this, you and I will live together forever. As eternal as gods."</p>
<p>She smiles, "It will be incredible."</p>
<p>You touch her chin with a gentle hand and lie to her, "And all thanks to you my dear. We wouldn't be here without the rites you found for me. Your brilliance shall shine like a beacon, for all time."</p>
<p>"We did it together!" She lies back.</p>
<p><i>Idiot child.</i></p>
<p>"Let us begin," you turn towards your side of the circle, "Eternity waits for no one!"</p>
<p>"Of course!" She takes her position and begins the ritual.</p>
<p><i>She didn't even examine the circle.</i></p>
<p>The first portion of the ritual takes but moments. You aren't a master of the arcane of course, but for this it is not needed. The work is already done.</p>
<p>As the ritual nears its true beginnings, flecks of ash rise from the circle. The girl's face grows concerned. She's not sure that should happen. If she knew what she was looking at she would be terrified.</p>
<p>You step out of your place in the circle.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Fear creeps into her voice. You do not answer her.</p>
<p>You approach the withered fledgling, the white phoenix chained to the pedestal. It watches you with eyes devoid of hope.</p>
<p><i>Are you finally going to end me?</i> It asks in your mind.</p>
<p><i>Yes.</i> You reply.</p>
<p><i>Good</i>, it replies with relief, <i>take my soul and choke on it.</i> </p>
<p><i>We have no souls.</i></p>
<p>From under your robe you draw the dagger, crafted from the stolen horn of a devil. In a swift movement you plunge it into the phoenix's chest.</p>
<p>The phoenix shrieks in agony. The girl screams in fear and confusion. Power flows through you. You plunge the dagger deeper.  It melts in your hand, leaving you feeling the heat inside the creature as you reach your bare fingers through its ribcage. You feel the red hot coal of its heart beating in your fingers. You rip it free </p>
<p>You have a few seconds. You allow yourself a few moments to admire the white hot jewel in you fingers. You look to the girl and begin to walk towards her.</p>
<p>She is rooted to the spot. Burning chains of ferocious heat crackle on her exposed skin. The ritual holds her in place. The only thing that can move is her eyes, starting at you with terror.</p>
<p>You walk towards her.</p>
<p>The heat of the heart flares in your hand. A wave of heat passes over you as the phoenix erupt into flame behind you. You plunge the burning heart into her exposed chest.</p>
<p>She can't even scream. Tears run down her face, in what must be incredible agony. The heat of the heart burns through skin and bone as if it were butter. You release the heart and remove your hand.</p>
<p>The phoenix's pyre burns behind you, never to reform again. You watch the burned tunnel through her chest slowly knit closed, sealing the heart inside.</p>
<p>Her face frozen, but her eyes tell of confusion, betrayal, and agony. You have time.</p>
<p>"Beautiful girl," you touch her cheek and smile, "Passionate girl. Stubborn strong, and <i>catastrophically</i> foolish."</p>
<p>"You think I didn't know?" You continue, "You thought I would just accept what you gave me? Simply bask in your glorious talent? Or did you simply expect me to not examine the rituals because <i>you</i> didn't?"</p>
<p>The devil fang dagger reforms in your hand. The phoenix's pyre flares.</p>
<p>"You think I didn't know what you thought of me? What you were planning? Stupid, rebellious girl. You thought you had me where you wanted. I always knew of your allegiance. I know about your friends. They will die too, so you know. The truth, stupid girl, is that I only let you live this long so I could use you for this."</p>
<p>You flip the dagger in your hands and smile a genuine smile.</p>
<p>"This will take time."</p>
<p>You step closer to her. Something interrupts you. A sound. You listen. It is a howl. A hunting call.</p>
<p>"No!" You bark as you run towards the other end of the circle. You force yourself to stop. Breaking the circle would be suicide. The howl rises. <i>Close</i>.</p>
<p>"Damn you Dreyrugr, why <i>now!?</i>" You snarl. You don't have time. The ritual will take hours to complete and…</p>
<p>The girl screams. You whip around.</p>
<p>She has fallen to her knees. She cries out in agony as the bands of infernal fire sear her flesh like a steak on a grill. She should not be able to move at all, yet she struggles against them. As her hand burns nearly to ash, she reaches for the edge of the circle.</p>
<p>"No!" You scream as you lunge towards her, "You stupid girl, you'll kill us all!"</p>
<p>Bound in blood crimson fire, she turns to look at you. Her eyes are filled with tears and agony, but also hate and rage. You reach out to pull her away. You are too late. The girl drags her hand across the line and breaks the circle.</p>
<p>Everything becomes pain.</p>
<p>A weeping girl was thrown from the memory, into the infinite expanse of the plane of eternal memory. She cried out in pain and confusion. A billion memories assaulted her mind, dragging her away.</p>
<p><i>No.</i></p>
<p><i>I am the Fury. I am the daughter of the sun. The heart of a phoenix beats in my chest. I am passion made manifest. I am a pyre of pure will. <b>I will not be denied.</b></i></p>
<p>The Fury asserted herself, a burning mask in a sea of infinite light. She felt herself being dragged towards her body. She willed herself to stay put. Fiery light erupted across the memoryscape before her, burning other lights around her. She recognized it.</p>
<p><i>The Conflagration.</i></p>
<p>She watched as lights winked out in the flames. Thousands of them. Yet others were changing, burning into yellow and red.</p>
<p><i>Us.</i></p>
<p>There was something else. A connection between every one of the fire elves. Something not present in the lights that were burned out.</p>
<p><i>It's not random!</i> She would gasp if she had lungs, <i>the ones who died and the ones who transformed, it wasn't random! There is a connection!</i></p>
<p>As the fire spread, she was pulled away. She tried to resist, but it was like trying to out-will gravity. The fire pulled away from her.</p>
<p><i>I have to know!</i> She begged, <i>Please!</i></p>
<p>A gentle female voice filled every corner of her mind.</p>
<p><i>Every fire requires fuel, tinder, and a spark.</i></p>
<p>The Fury ached as she realized what that meant. Fate tried to tear her away, magic more powerful than she had ever experienced tried to rip her away from the voice. The Fury was not moved.</p>
<p><i>Please.</i> She asked.</p>
<p>The voice answered.</p>
<p><i>You, Aelia Bonebear, were the spark.</i></p>
<p>The Fury awoke on the stone floor of her studio. She bolted upright, drying tears seeping through her mask. She was at the center of a singed blast circle, her materials scorched and flung to the edges of the room.</p>
<p><i>My mask! My name!</i></p>
<p>She touched her mask, but the subtle energy of the ritual was still there. How? She glanced at her arm. The tattoo was still there, but changed.</p>
<p>The magic was gone. The geometric patterns were gone, replaced by a wreathe of metallic crimson flames. The eyes of the mask glowed like molten gold.</p>
<p><i>How?</i></p>
<p>"Hello," a voice rasped behind her.</p>
<p>“YEEEP!”</p>
