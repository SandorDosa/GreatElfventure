        A Deal Burned

<body>
<p>It is not difficult to track down Breaker in the camp outside Riverhaven. As the Terror marches through, generally anyone she encounters points her in Breaker's direction. She does not even need to ask.</p>
<p>As she walks through the Cazadore encampment, the Terror gets an impression of just how hard fought their escape was. Most of them are wounded to some degree or another, and they bear the weariness of long travel. It is very apparent that they had no magic healing available, and precious few medical supplies. A small number are sporting burns, but those that have them seem severe.</p>
<p>The Terror finds Breaker, of course, with the horses. A number of Cazadores are tending to them, cleaning wounds, replacing horseshoes, and cleaning off a couple hundred miles of dirt.</p>
<p>Breaker is quietly talking to her horse, that now bears a pair of long scars on its flank. She is gently petting its nose and whispering to it. She bears her own scars. Instead of the poncho, she is wearing a light shirt. Her entire torso is covered in bandages, as is most of her right arm and her neck. The edges of angry healing burns poke out around her chin and jawline up to the ear on her right side, as well as her right hand. As Terror approaches, she falls quiet.</p>
<p>"Hola, Espanta," she calls out to Terror in a tired voice without turning around, "Come to lecture me again? Or maybe just stare and gloat, no?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Barrel thirteen," the Terror said quietly. She turned away, and leaned against the stable. "I should have forewarned you. The failure was mine."</p>
<p>Breaker forces down a laugh, "Si, of course it was, shoulda guessed that."</p>
<p>She pauses and pets her horse for a moment, before speaking quietly, "I didn't ask. You didn't fail shit. I did. Coyote had me as soon as I walked in the fucking gate. Without your bomb, I'd be a corpse and so would everyone here. So don't fucking apologize to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fine." The Terror paused. "Did you lose many?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>She nods quietly, "More to blades than fire. Some of my best officers."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror nodded. "I've interrogated Leafstorm," she said after a minute. "If there was a leak to Coyote, it was not from him; he knew nothing -- not even of the Horse."</p>
<p>"It was me," Breaker replies, "Coyote's had two decades to pick apart my brain. He probably knows me better than I do."</p>
<p>She gently pats her horse once more, then suddenly lashes out and punches the stable wall. "You were fucking right about me. I'm exactly what Coyote made me. His weapon. His fucking toy. I can't hide shit from him. It was my fault for fucking buying his bullshit for that long and thinking I was anything else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So what are you going to do about it?"</p>
<p>"Kill the hijueputa," she responds quietly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And afterwards?"</p>
<p>"I don't care. I'm sure the stoners and the pollos will want to see me go down. Throw me in a cell, cut off my hands, hang me, I don't care. Just hang Coyote first so I can hear the bastard's neck snap."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're letting him define you. You shouldn't. Kill him, but end it there."</p>
<p>"It won't end there." She takes a slow breath then goes back to her horse, "I ain't the type to make excuses. Coyote may have had his fingers in my soup, but I did what I did with open eyes. I was the one who decided to take hostages. I killed people, I stole from them, hells they have the lizards on their side now. I killed&hellip; a lot of them."</p>
<p>She closes her eyes and slowly resumes brushing her horse, "I did all those things, not Coyote. I won't pretend. I knew what I was doing. They won't let that go. They can't. What are they gonna say, 'Hey bitch, you murdered my friends but you switched and murdered my enemies too so all good now?' Mierda, even the Pollos aren't that naive."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You weren't acting alone," Terror said, a bit of grating steel sneaking into her voice. "I guess they'll have to cut off the other Cazardores' hands too. Hang them. Send them out to die in the desert. But Coyote will be dead, so good enough, I suppose."</p>
<p>She pauses and stops moving before answering, "Talked it through with Shadimon. If the Cazadores help refugees through the badlands, then they can get amnesty. Their families, at least. Maybe if they focus on me as the one to hate, it'll be enough to let that happen."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...Has Shadimon actually said you aren't included in that, or are you just assuming that you're not because its convenient?"</p>
<p>"Shadimon's too nice," she shakes her head, "I'm sure he was thinking he'd forgive me, but he wasn't there. Someone has to pay for what we did, and it won't just be Coyote."</p>
<p>"Cal's eighth arm, you're dedicated to this," Terror growled. "Dying isn't a punishment, its a fucking escape. You think the Cazardores won't need leadership whether Coyote is alive or dead? You think they'll be happy to have one of us looming over them without their say?"</p>
<p>She stepped back to the front of the stable, and flicked a slice of apple in Breaker's horse's direction. "Take it from someone else who's had to make that decision: you running will hurt them worse than you staying."</p>
<p>The horse catches the piece of apple out of the air, then snorts and gives Breaker a sideways look. She opens her mouth as if to yell at Terror, but then closes it and returns the horse's look. She sighs and leans against the wall.</p>
<p>"And what if I fuck up? What if I really am just what he turned me into?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Then you fight it," Terror said. "Fight it, and kill it or break it to your needs. He shaped you into his weapon? Fine. Stab him with it, and then put it to better use. But don't give up and die. Don't give him that."</p>
<p>She paused. "...I'll admit, I'm comparing you to myself a bit here, and I'm not sure that's fair to you."</p>
<p>Breaker blinks at the Terror then gives an honest laugh, "Pues, if you're the light at the end of the tunnel it must be a pretty fucking rough tunnel I got myself in. Better than a noose though. You don't give pep talks too often, do you?" </p>
<p>Terror chuckled, and wiped a hand over her mask with embarrassment. "Not often these days. I'm a little rusty."</p>
<p>Breaker smiles and folds her arms at the chuckle, "Ah, so you are alive under there. I was starting to wonder."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Didn't say that," Terror said mildly. "Though I'll admit, it&rsquo;s nice to actually talk now and then. I don't really... talk a lot anymore."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, it shows,&rdquo; Breaker&rsquo;s smile fades slightly, &ldquo;I needed to hear it, you know? Shadimon, Dust, even Baijani. They&rsquo;re all too fucking nice. You took all my bullshit and threw it in my face. Called me out on it. I needed that, si?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Glad to help," Terror said. She paused. "Coyote's next move -- any idea on what he'd aim for?"</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, if he can find me,&rdquo; she shrugs, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be pissed off, but he&rsquo;ll play smart. I slapped him in the face and left. He won&rsquo;t let that go. Can&rsquo;t. It would make him look weak, si? Like you can escape him. So he&rsquo;ll come for me, but he&rsquo;ll make sure he finds me and make sure there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll escape. The people here too, anything to make sure he proves no one gets away from him. Past that? He&rsquo;ll be itching for a way to get back at you and yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How fast will he respond? His own upper echelons likely took a hit in your escape. Especially if the fire elementals didn't trigger until you were already out the door."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He'll have to regroup first, si. He won't come after me without making sure his shit is together, but he's gonna start <em>looking </em>for me as soon as he can."</p>
<p>"And here is likely the first place he'd look." Terror sighed. "I have a plan, but we need more time -- and more troops. A lot more. And we need a good idea of when his cavalry will move."</p>
<p>"Lo siento, I'm pretty sure I can't pull rank and find out for you anymore. We have a season, at least. Maybe two. He'll keep his Cazadores screening for incoming while he licks his wounds, and he'll get them back up to full strength if he possibly can. If he gets his sights on me he's coming, but he'll wait to move until he's sure. Keep him guessing where we are, he might hesitate. Maybe. He's hard to predict and he's got a talent for knowing when he's being played."</p>
<p>She frowns, "Goes for my people here, too. He knows where the civvies are, he won't blink at hitting them. We're all top on his shit list now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...How much would losing his forward operating base slow him down?" Terror asked. "...We might be able to make use of some misdirection here, as well. If we move the horses and sufficient troops back to Surt, we might be able to convince him that your Cazadores have moved north. Particularly with an appropriate disguise."</p>
<p>Breaker shakes her head, "He'll have already written that outpost off as a loss since I know where it is and is probably already planning to set up another one. We did that a lot during the war. He needs it to keep up operations far from home. Misdirection could work, yeah. Have to be a hell of a good one, though."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror grunted. "Flappies might be able to spot the new outpost as its being constructed -- particularly if we know what to look for. I'll have to ask them to scout around. Locating that outpost and setting a trap there is likely our strongest offensive option.</p>
<p>"But to do that, we'll need more time, more troops, and a way to make sure the Cazadores will be going there, while still protecting our settlements. We might be able to tempt him out with a lure -- exposed refugees, a Potemkin convoy, maybe a strong enough illusion over a few hundred spiked pits -- but he's a bit more aware of our strategies now, so anything we offer him has to be so good he can't afford not to take it. Which means you and yours.</p>
<p>"If we made the lure far enough out, we might be able to force his troops to go to their outpost first, on their way over, so they aren't exhausted before the assault. That's a pretty big if, however, but that also means the forces moving in to the forward outpost would already be fatigued.</p>
<p>"...Or I guess we could make it look like you were pushed out by the Dreamdust elves, and moved to the old outpost as the only place you could go. That's a lot of risk for your people, and means he knows he'll be rolling in on a fight, but that also means he'll be going where we want him to be. It'll just also leave a lot of others exposed."</p>
<p>"I can see why you don't talk too often," Breaker sighs with apparent exhaustion, "Once you get some steam in you, you don't stop. I don't know what your people have or what you're planning, but if you keep our families safe we'll do anything you ask us to, si?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror nodded. "Sorry. Strategizing is a lot of what I do these days." She straightened back up. "I'll let you get back to it. I'll probably have more questions later... and I'll try to space them out a bit more."</p>
<p>"Not going anywhere," Breaker folds her arms and gives Terror an odd look, "I'll fight what Coyote made me. I'll promise you that. I gotta ask something in return though. If I fuck up and end up being&hellip; whatever the fuck I was becoming, you kill me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if you will return the favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaker meets Terror&rsquo;s eyes with curiosity. She watches the bronze-clad warrior carefully for a few moments. Instead of asking any questions or making any smart comments, Breaker simply nods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Terror bowed her head, and then swept off, cloak waving and rattling behind her. Breaker watches her leave. After the armored figure has left, the horse snorts and rolls her eyes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one asked you, Bravia,&rdquo; Breaker grunts.</p>
