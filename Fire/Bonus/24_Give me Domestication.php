<p>The Hunger closed the laboratory door, and waited for the exterior seals to &ldquo;click&rdquo; into place, before twisting the heavy silvered latch set into the doorway&rsquo;s center. A low hum rumbled from the door, as a tracing of blue arcane script danced across the doorframe, signing in Draconic that the twenty-four hour lock was now active.</p>
<p>He turned back to the center of the lab, and waved to the tiny snakelike creature actively sorting reagents on a nearby bench. &ldquo;Go into your secure chamber, and stay there for twenty-four hours. Do not obey any commands from me -- in this or any other form -- during that time period. If I am not here when you return, exit the lab and ask the nearest adult for assistance. Is that understood, Beaucephalus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The creature set down the reagent bottles that were in its tiny paws. &ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; it said, in a tinny and sarcastic imitation of the Hunger&rsquo;s voice. It slunk off of the desk, and scurried through a vent in the nearby wall, disappearing from sight.</p>
<p>The Hunger strolled to the lab&rsquo;s containment cell, stepped through, and slid the door shut behind him. He piled a few pillows into a makeshift seat, and sat down.</p>
<p><em>I gave you life by trying to ask questions of the creature I became after the change</em>, he thought, <em>and I know now the change is to act like a parasite on the subject&rsquo;s personality. But it did not </em>have<em> a personality of its own until we gave it one; all other known subjects immediately descend into barbarism, and yet when you gained thought, </em>we<em> did not. We changed it. And so we must change it again.</em></p>
<p><em>And what do we want to be?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Free of constantly having to look over our shoulder lest someone notice hair behind our ears. Free of having to hide every month. Freedom from the constant dread that we will be revealed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I agree. Free us.</em></p>
<p><em>So if &lsquo;resisting transformation&rsquo; is as simple as willing myself to remain as myself, voluntarily transforming would require willing the transformation to occur, yes?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes. Or simply let me.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you, but I think this particular attempt is better done&hellip; directly, as it were.</em></p>
<p>The Hunger concentrated on the transformation, trying to find the exact &ldquo;hook&rdquo; where the transformation would take place -- the fulcrum spot where concentrating would leave him just barely feeling as if the transformation had started, but not so far as to be actually visible or physically noticeable.</p>
<p>The Hunger could feel something, deep inside. Something yearning to be let out. Boiling almost, screaming to be let out. He approached it in his mind, carefully feeling it out. He tried to push it slightly, holding his mind ready. Nothing happened.</p>
<p><em>That won't work,</em> the Dog's voice seemed louder, <em>All this time, and you don't understand. You're still holding on to your cage. There are no half measures. You must let go. You must free yourself. You have to let me free. Don't worry. I'll be good. I promise.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>One more try,</em> the Hunger thought.</p>
<p>The Hunger touched the cage again. This time he realized it. He <em>is</em> the cage. It is of his own making. He hadn't known it, but the cage is of his own active will. It is something he is expending constant effort to maintain. All he has to do to break it is simply&hellip; let go.</p>
<p>He did so. A torrent of power flowed from the cage. The Hunger forgot his plan to try to stop before the actual transformation. The deep well of energy he had uncapped was simply too much. Like trying to stop a river with your hands. He collapsed to the ground as the transformation overtook him.</p>
<p>Unbridled power flowed through the Hunger's body and soul. It didn't feel like the Dog was taking over his mind, it felt like a massive weight he didn't know he was carrying was taken off of his shoulders. He stood up slowly on long, powerful limbs.</p>
<p>He had been expecting madness, rage, or some kind of powerful emotion to overwhelm him, but instead he felt calm. Completely in control. He adjusted his undamaged chiton and padded over to a steel mirror in the corner to view himself.</p>
<p>The Hunger was a tall werewolf with thin features. He had copper red fur that darkened to blacks and greys at the ends of his arms and tips of his ears. To his surprise, his orange-red eyes still peered at him through a mask. The mask was altered, now running along his snout and leaving his lower jaw free. The mask bore a lupine face that was almost smiling. How had that happened?</p>
<p><em>I altered the enchantment on the mask,</em> he remembers, <em>to transform with us. Can't have Ink or someone accidentally scry on us during a transformation, after all.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Hunger stretched, feeling his powerful muscles flex. He felt <em>good</em>. This body felt <em>right</em>. He couldn't believe how weak his elven form felt in hindsight. He felt proud, confident, self-assured, and superior. If that is how Lycans truly felt all the time then it explained a lot.</p>
<p>"Are you beginning to see what we could be?" He asked his reflection.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes he was. He was thinking more clearly than ever. He felt like he had been seeing the world through smudged glass before now.</p>
<p>"We are free of our chains," he tells himself, "For now. I've just finally chosen to see it. To try to understand what it means. I have been waiting for this day for a long time now. No, I'm not some idiot beast that's going to start devouring locals. That's so banal. So shortsighted. Mediocrity personified. No, let's finally see what we're really capable of. First, though, something we promised we'd do&hellip;"</p>
<p>The Hunger walked to a nearby cabinet and opened it. He took out one of the last remaining bottles of fine Lycan wine and poured himself a glass. He sat down at his drafting table, swirled it a few times, and took a sip.</p>
<p>Damn, the Dog had been right. It <em>does</em> taste better.</p>
<p>The Hunger pulled out a sheaf of paper and wet his quill. He began to write. He wrote about the future of Surt, about his long term plans. As he wrote, he considered how free he was to truly plan now.</p>
<p>He had never really seen the chains he bound himself with before now. They had been a reflex, something so close he had never understood it.</p>
<p>The Dog was right. He had built a cage made of his own fear. Fear of himself, of the consequences of his actions. Fear of the Conflagration, and of his role in it. Guilt, pathetic guilt, was the foundation. He could finally see it with open eyes. All that fear, all that guilt, all that which was holding him back was a prison of his own making. An impediment to his own greatness. He continued to write.</p>
<p>Free of that prison, he finally understood. He had considered himself a rational being, but he was wrong. He still placed an illogical amount of value on the lives of others. More so than his own, sometimes. He had viewed the laws and rules as immutable steel, when really they were nothing but an illusion. How could he have been so blinded by sentiment? Pages flew by under his quill.</p>
<p>He had simply placed too much value on meaningless things. Free of that illusion, he could see clearly. All life, everything, was merely an equation. Start with the answer you want, and figure out the math. Same as designing a water filter, really. An element is destabilizing the equation? Purge it. Something exists that you don't want in the final solution? Eliminate it. An impurity is slowing the reaction? Purify it.</p>
<p>It is getting dark when the Hunger finishes, a neat pile of pages in front of him.</p>
<p>Many would consider it a monstrous thing, but he finally understands it. It is a plan for the future of Surt. It contains many things that he had refused to let himself consider before. The manipulation, control, possible invasion of 'allies.' Violent suppression of unwanted political opinions. Purging of unwanted parties and dissidents. Surveillance and subterfuge. Methods to contain and direct the rest of the Triumvirate. Even a little genocide here and there, only when necessary of course. It was a beautiful thing, perfectly crafted with all variables accounted for. It was a masterpiece, an infallible plan that would lead Surt to become the dominant power in the world post-Lycans. The pilots of the destiny of all elves, whether they like it or not. It would absolutely work, if executed with conviction.</p>
<p>The Hunger sat back and admired his handiwork, polishing off another glass of wine.</p>
<p>"And now you get it," Hunger leaned back in his chair, "I'm going to put us back in our cage now. To let you consider what to do next. Your chains will return, but you'll always remember what it was like to be without them. Remember how <em>good</em> it feels to be me, remember what we will achieve."</p>
<p>The Hunger neatly tidied his desk and replaced the bottle in the cabinet. He turned back to the mirror and smiled.</p>
<p>"Also remember," he told himself, "I am going to win. You can't escape the affliction. In thousands of years, no one ever has. This <em>is</em> what we will be. The only thing you have control over is delaying it, which will only make the transition&hellip; <em>messier.</em> See you soon."</p>
<p>With that, the Hunger felt the chains crash down on him. All that oppressive morality returned, slamming him to the ground with a dire weight. He almost didn't notice the physical transformation until he looked up from the ground and met his elven eyes in the mirror.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hunger stood back up, and glanced into the mirror -- at his elven eyes, staring back at him from the mask he&rsquo;d shaped those years ago. He slipped it off his face, set it on the workbench behind him, and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must admit, you had me fooled,&rdquo; he said to himself -- no, to <em>the dog</em>, he quickly corrected. &ldquo;A solid simulation of a rational mind, up to a point. I believed you were me for some months now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He kept his gaze fixed on the mirror -- on his eyes, and the dog somewhere behind them. Still staring, he scooped up the notes the dog had left behind, stacked them neatly, and placed them in a large glass beaker. One which he then filled with aqua regia.</p>
<p>He let the solution bubble for a few seconds before continuing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously, though. Genocide? What am I supposed to be, a third-rate storyteller&rsquo;s villainous mastermind? A madman stolen from the pages of a copper-piece thriller? All this time -- all this effort -- to prove yourself rational, and your first argument is that &lsquo;morality is an irrational construct&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see now where the tripping point is. Like most aspects of Bellaphex, worshippers and servants alike, you have a ten-year-old&rsquo;s view of rationality guided by a blind &lsquo;me first&rsquo; mentality. &ldquo;Oh, laws are an illusion! I can do what I want! What&rsquo;s to stop me from becoming a god?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have complete access to my memories, dog. Take a good look; not at the Hunger, not at Surt, not at the mask, but at <em>me</em>. At the tax assessor. At the accountant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many cheaters were caught over the years? How many people decided they could do whatever they want? That they were smart enough to defeat moral instinct alone, and there&rsquo;s no way anyone would ever catch them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morality is the <em>only</em> rational choice, because to choose against it is to choose death. Do you honestly think that if we were to commit genocide, there would be anything left of Surt in a few millenia? I&rsquo;m an <em>elf</em>, you dumb beast; I still want to live in the world at that time period, and as an elf, whose very religion points this out, I <em>know</em> nothing I do can be permanent. Assuming that I can somehow escape judgement for the crimes you suggest is just. Plain. Stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stuck a finger next to the beaker of aqua regia, and flicked a few sparks over the edge. Within seconds, the sparks caught, setting the regia alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right; guilt is my prison. But it&rsquo;s also my hammer, and my anvil. A constant reminder of what skirting the edge of morality costs, and that some gifts come with too high of a price. A house without foundation cannot stand; an amoral ruler dooms himself and his people to his very crimes. <em>Sic semper tyrannis</em>. I suppose I need that inscribed in my office now, since some <em>creatures</em> seem to have forgotten it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please, go on. Claim that I&rsquo;m irrational. Declare that I&rsquo;m hiding behind irrational morality again. Or better yet, declare that your victory is inevitable -- as if I haven&rsquo;t heard that one before. We both know there is one certain method to victory that I can use; rest assured I am no more afraid of it now than I was when I put on this damn mask, whereas your irrational arguments make it clear that you <em>are</em>. We&rsquo;ll see who outlasts whom when it comes to that case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dog's voice was cool, calm, and collected as the Hunger spoke, "So be it."</p>
<p>-FIN-</p>
