    <h1>A Surtian Confusion</h1>
    <p>In the last days of Spring, Partager has docked at the village of Gerdr right outside the city of Surt.  Several days of busy unloading and loading of goods between the flotilla and the city followed, and the dread wizard Smilisca was far too busy with the work to keep track of an underfoot apprentice and his pal.  This made for an excellent opportunity for Acris to get out of his chores for a while.</p>
    <p>And by “get out of his chores” he meant to hike over to the big city and try to help his friend with her sword problems.  Certainly Surt has a weaponsmith somewhere.</p>
    <p>“Kind of a problem there, though,” Cel says, holding a dry reed up to the tiny hippo poking its head out of her backpack. “We’d need a lot of money to get one of the smith’s around here to fix it.” </p>
    <p>She gestures over to the front gates of Surt, just a few dozen paces from where the two elves stood. The white city walls were scattered with lost flower petals, and shaded by deep grey clouds that were steadily rolling into place overhead. </p>
    <p>“Do you really want to go in there, anyway?” Cel says. “It’s kind of miserable and boring. And stupid.” </p>
    <p>Raucous laughter and singing echoes out through the front gate. A trickle of black smoke, swirling with strands of purple and amber, leaks out from somewhere just beyond.</p>
    <p>“And then there’s that stuff,” Cel says. “Partying in the middle of the street, getting in everyone’s way and setting things on fi-- hey now, that’s my hair!” She twists her head around, and starts trying to extricate the edge of her ponytail from Boots’ mouth. </p>
    <p>“Weh...” Acris agreed, but his heart wasn’t in it.  “Sounds real dull like.  Jus’ <span class="tooltip">fais do do.<span class="tooltiptext">Something that puts someone to sleep. (Or a party at which there is a space set aside for children to sleep so their parents can stay later.</span></span>”  He took a few steps toward the gate while Cel was distracted.  “It’ll jus’ be a little detour,” he assured the native guide, “Can’t not try, weh?”</p>
    <p>Gate traffic picked up at that point, with a flow of elves coming and going, making it difficult to travel against the current.</p>
    <p>“Allons!” Acris shouts to Cel, “We got’s to go now.”</p>
    <p>“What?” Cel says, fighting Boots for her own fingers. “Oh! Fine then. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, though.”</p>
    <p>The main street bustles with travelers and street vendors, who have turned out in droves for the influx of River Elves coming up from Gerdr. Stalls choke the path through the gate, leading up to a crowd surrounding a wide bonfire. </p>
    <p>“See?” Cel shouts, trying to get Acris’ attention over the roar of the crowd. “This stuff is crazy!”</p>
    <p>"Biggest amphoras in town!" one of the vendors shouts, holding up a sealed jar. "Don't wait for the tavern -- get you drunk on right now!"</p>
    <p>"Hot meat rods!" a cook shouts into the crowd. She holds up a trio of wooden skewers, packed with sausages and actively on fire. "Fresh and juicy!"</p>
    <p>"You there, good sir," an old elf says, looming over Acris from out of his stall. Blue smoke wafts from his beard. "You have a spellcaster's aura about you; an old wizard like myself can see it in you." He pulls a mottled chunk of basalt off the side of his desk, and held it up. "Have you found yourself a familiar yet?"</p>
    <p>As he speaks, the basalt rock's color began to shift, as if lit by some internal source. </p>
    <p>“Noooon...” Acris stands mesmerized by the display of colors from a piece of stone.  “I ain’t really put no thought inna familiar, me.”  He contemplates the really terrible hat for a moment before looking back at the very impressive rock.</p>
    <p>"Well, well," the old elf says. "I had wondered what woke her this morning, and it sounds like it was the call of destiny. This, young elf, is a magma rock; a rare and exceptional magical creature from deep in the Marr--"</p>
    <p>"Cal's grace don't buy a rock!" Cel says, shoving Acris away from the stand and further down the road.</p>
    <p>"She'll wait for you, young mage!" the old wizard calls, shouting over Cel's back.</p>
    <p>"Shove it!" Cel shouts back. </p>
    <p>Acris grins at Cel and pats Boots on the snout.</p>
    <p>“We’ll find one on our own if’n we need to, weh.”  He plaps down the street as they continue to follow the flow of traffic.</p>
    <p>“Right,” Cel says. “And that was just a rock anyway. Seriously.”</p>
    <p>Traffic shoves the two young elves straight into the crowd around the bonfire, and then right up to the clearing at the center. </p>
    <p>A band of bards sit beside the bonfire, strumming through a low, smooth melody, while more than a dozen Firedancers parade through the center of the bonfire, performing a complicated acrobatic dance involving lots of swinging hips and rapidly decreasing fabric.</p>
    <p>Cel rolls her eyes. "And then there's this stuff. Come on; we’re almost out.” </p>
    <p>“Woah.”  Acris stops to stare.  “How do they <i>do</i> that?”  His skin feels itchy and dry just thinking about it.</p>
    <p>“The part where they sing and pretend to be mystical, or the part where they wiggle their butts a lot?” Cel says, giving Acris a sideways glance. </p>
    <p>“Non, neither,” Aris says with awe, as he watches a Firedancer step directly on a hot coal without flinching.  “That part where they’s not even lookin’ a little crispy fried.”</p>
    <p>“Oh!” Cel says. “Nah, that’s normal enough for us Fire Elves. It’s like you folks and rivers; we’re all just kind of… good at being on fire, the same way you’re good at swimming. And it looks fancy, but it’s not different from a public bath. Which is why it’s <i>super weird</i> when they treat it like its a show or something. <i>Super weird</i>.” </p>
    <p>“Weh, Cel, tha’ looks like magic t’ me.”  Acris shrugs.  “So yer sayin’ you can do that?”  He points a thumb to a Firedancer doing cartwheels.</p>
    <p>Cel nods. “Yeah, sure. And a bit less like I’m about to fall over on my face while doing it. It’s just fire -- not much different than cleaning up with a torch.” </p>
    <p>“Mais la!” Acris exclaims, “So you’s been thinkin’ all that’s magical an’ amazin’ bout yerself is just boring?  What other borin’ junk yall got hidden up in hurr?”  He gestures widely to the city.  “Come’on!  Ya gotta show me aroun’, weh!”</p>
    <p>Cel blinks, her face flickering with a brief hint of light. “All right,” she says after a second. “Let’s get out of here, and I’ll try to take us someplace interesting.”</p>
    <p>She shoves her way through the crowd, and out into the street beyond. “We could visit <i>the Howl</i>,” Cel continues. “That’s always exciting. Or climb up to one of the filter stations and get a good look at the place. Oooh -- or we could check out the caves.” She gestures over to one of the valley’s far walls. “Maybe a monster or two’ll poke their heads up and attack us. That’d be exciting, right?”</p>
    <p>“Weh!” Acris readily agrees, “An if’n we do all three we’ll not be ‘round when the Oarmaster’s handin’ out tasks fer the Embarkment!”</p>
    <p>Cel nods, and turns towards a sidestreet, lined on both sides with shops selling forged metalwork. “We’ll go to a filter station first, so you can get a good look--”</p>
    <p>Her eyes fall on copper-haired elf, standing beside several barrels of iron nails and fasteners. She had a narrow face, with a vaguely lupine cut to it. </p>
    <p>Cel grabs Acris’ hand. “Going to <i>the Howl</i> first!” she says. She begins dashing for a nearby alleyway. </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The Howl practically boiled with activity, as scores of elves dove in and out of it, plunging through the crowds to reach the bar or getting sucked and shoved into the tavern’s depths. </p>
    <p>Cel forces her way to the bar’s near side, dragging Acris in behind her. “Two ales, please!” she yells, before giving the counter a loud slap.</p>
    <p>The nearest bartender glances over to her. “No,” he says, shoving a pair of mugs into a customer’s hands.</p>
    <p>“Some mead, then,” Cel says quickly.</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>Cel glares. “What, are you out of everything?”</p>
    <p>“We don’t serve alcohol to juveniles,” he continues, not even looking up. “Triumvirate policy, and we’re not babysitters. If you want something to eat, the menu’s burnt onto the wall behind me. ‘Til then, I’ve got other customers to serve.” </p>
    <p>Cel rolls her eyes. “Just some dolmas then.”</p>
    <p>The bartender nods to her, and then shouts something to one of the other bartenders, currently retreating through the kitchen door.</p>
    <p>Cel unstraps her backpack from one side, and leans back against the bar, while pulling the bag (and its wiggling contents) up to shoulder height. “Exciting place, huh?” she says, glancing between Acris and Boots. </p>
    <p>“What’s a dolmas?” Acris asks, absorbing the activity around him with interest.</p>
    <p>“Grape leaves and barley,” Cel says, patting Boots on the snout. She swiveled back around to face Acris. “They’re pretty good. And I bet Boots’ll love them.”</p>
    <p>"Plus, it means we don't have to stay here too long," she says. "If you don't want to, I mean. It's so crowded, all kinds o' trouble could be sneaking up on us right no--"</p>
    <p>A hand drops on Cel's shoulder. "Quite strange," the barrel-chested owner of the hand says. His mustache quivers. </p>
    <p>Cel winces. " 'lo, Captain Doukas," she says quietly. </p>
    <p>"Last I heard, you were hiding out in Fort Alfyr, making a nuisance of yourself and messing up their training regimen," he continues. "I finally have time to send someone up to retrieve you, and then <i>they</i> find out when they get there that you've snuck off on a River Elf convoy." He glances at Acris, and then at the hippo poking its head out of Cel’s pack. “Making friends, apparently. Your mother has nearly worried herself to death,” he says.</p>
    <p>“She’s not my mom,” Cel says, turning a glare in Doukas’ direction.</p>
    <p>Doukas rolls his eyes. “She’s closer than many get. Now, come on--”</p>
    <p>“Order up!” the bartender says, dropping a plate covered in sticky, leaf-wrapped tubes on the bar in front of them. “Evening, your lordship,” he says, spotting Doukas.</p>
    <p>Doukas nods. “Evening, Twofl--”</p>
    <p>Cel grabs the plate off the table and spins it towards Doukas’ face.</p>
    <p>Dolmas scatter. Doukas takes the plate directly to the nose, splattering his eyes and dress uniform with olive oil. He puts both hands to his face, wincing.</p>
    <p>“Come on!” Cel yells, grabbing Acris by the arm and making for the exit.</p>
    <p>Acris does his very best to catch at least one of the leaf tubes before Cel can pull him away.  And then he sticks hard to her heels, doing his very best to keep up as they dodge through the crowd.</p>
    <p>When they hit the streets and Cel has slowed down some, Acris asks her a brief question:</p>
    <p>“You didn’t say you got family in town, non?”  He munches the snagged leafy snack to keep himself from asking anything else.</p>
    <p>Boots squeaks, chewing merrily on a grape leaf tube.</p>
    <p>“I don’t,” Cel says. “My family is dead.”</p>
    <p>“Who’sat Captain’s talkin’ bout then?”  Acris gives the rest of his snack to the tiny hippo.  “They a cousin or a nonc or somewhat’s?”</p>
    <p>Cel rolls her eyes. “Just… some people who let me stay at their house. They’re not related to me or anything.”</p>
    <p>“Kinda like Master Nonc an me are to you.  Wanna stop by an’ let em know where’yat so they’ll quit lookin?  If they ask we ken say yer doin’ your Journeyman work.”</p>
    <p>“No!” Cel says, shaking her head. “I mean… if we go there and tell them anything, they’ll make me stay here. They won’t get it.” </p>
    <p>"Weh, mebee they won't," Acris agrees, "Mais what're th' chances Parrain Ehra done already told em?"</p>
    <p>Cel pauses, and stops to lean against a nearby cart. “They… I didn’t tell them where I was going. Or that I was going. Or anything. I needed to find it out for myself. But if they knew where I was -- why didn’t they come looking for me? Or send someone to drag me out, or anything?” </p>
    <p>“Weh, Cel, you sure they didn’?”  Acris mimics the most thoughtful person he knows and rubs his head while he’s thinking.  It’s less effective of a gesture on someone with hair than when the Oarmaster pulls off the same maneuver.  “Mebee Parrain Ehra tol’ em to splash off so you coul’ do some learnin’.  It’s the kinda thing he’d do, it is, weh.”</p>
    <p>Cel sighs. “Maybe. And… I guess I should tell them what I’ve been up to, so they’ll know. It’s too late though, isn’t it? I already ran off -- its not like they’d want to see me after that.”</p>
    <p>“Non, I don’t think it’d be too late.”  Acris looks a bit forlornly at the ground.  “I don’ think it’d ever be too late.  I’d give my right arm and both m’legs t’ see my parents, me.  If’n they cared, they’d jus’ be happy yer back, e’en if not fer long, non?”</p>
    <p>"They're not my parents, though," Cel says hesitantly. "Not really." </p>
    <p>“Weh, mais they wanted you.”  Acris shrugs halfheartedly.  “For shore they’re missin’ you.”</p>
    <p>Cel stares at Acris for a second, a slight glow creeping up the back of her neck, and then grabs him into a tight hug. “Thank you,” she says, releasing him and taking a couple of steps back. “I… I think I needed to hear that. From someone else, I mean. ...You don’t mind if we go talk to them, right? I don’t want to cut off the tour.”</p>
    <p>Boots squeaks. An elf, tall and shrouded in smoke, steps out from behind the cart Cel had been leaning against.</p>
    <p>“I’m surrre there’s plenty of time,” the elf says.</p>
    <p>Cel spins, stepping back to stand between the elf and Acris. “Madcat,” she says quickly. “Been a while. We, uh… we’re just about to head home, so catch ya later--”</p>
    <p>“Jussst a moment, little Celosia,” Madcat says. A tube of brown leaves smolders in his hand. “We can walk and talk as we go. Who’s your friend?” </p>
    <p>Acris blushes a darker shade of green than normal.  He has a friend.  With so few people his age on the flotilla, this is a really exciting development.  But what kind of name is <i>Madcat</i>?</p>
    <p>“‘M Acris,” he fumbles the introduction excellently.  “I thinks we’re kinda in a hurry, me.  Gotta get all the big big sightseein’ in ‘afore we embark, us.”</p>
    <p>Cel nods, and grabs onto Acris’ hand. “Yep. See ya.” She dashes back up the road, towards the crowds around the tavern, dragging Acris behind her.</p>
    <p>Another smoke-wrapped elf steps out of an alleyway ahead of them. Cel dodges hard to the right, slipping neatly past his grip -- but Acris does not. The elf catches Acris by the collar and hauls him up against a nearby wall.</p>
    <p>Cel skids to a stop, eyes wide. </p>
    <p>“Slow dowwwn, juvie,” Madcat says. “Run through the city like that, and you might get someone hurt.” He stares at Acris, as if sizing him up. “Came in with the River Elf flotilla, didja? So that’s where you’ve been. We’ve been looking for ya a bit; I try to keep an eye on friends of mine. What about you… Acrissss, right? What’d’you do?”</p>
    <p>Acris makes an attempt, though not an honestly very good attempt, to cast one of his most trusty memorized spells.  Unfortunately, between the smoke, the pressure of his shirt collar against his throat, and the panic of being under someone else’s immediate control, the spell fizzles and fails instead of dumping water on the fire elf.  Acris doesn’t want to be seen as a pathetic failure in front of his only friend.</p>
    <p>“Mais, yanno, uh,” he mumbles vaguely before coming to the conclusion of what would be the absolute coolest most suave answer possible: “<span class="stuff">stuff.</span>”</p>
    <p>“Stufff, huh,” Madcat says. “My pals and I are big fans of stuff. Should head over to our place, and have a big discussion on stuff, for a while.”</p>
    <p>Cel’s hand strays down to the hilt of her sword. </p>
    <p>“Don’t get upsssset, Celosia,” Madcat says. “We’re just havin’ a chat. We’re all friends, here right? For now?”</p>
    <p>“Captain Doukas was right back here, looking for us,” Cel says. “You should probably just let us get on before he finds us. Or he’ll find you, too.” <span class="redacted">(Intimidate: 27)</span></p>
    <p>The elf holding Acris slides him back to the ground, and takes a couple steps back.</p>
    <p>“His lllordship, looking for you?” Madcat laughs. “Ha! If you got ‘is attention, I definitely want you as a friend. Right back up the road, by the Howl? Maybe we ought to take a quick trip up there, the group of us. Shake his hand and all.” </p>
    <p>Acris slides himself out of grabbing range, stopping to stand beside Cel.</p>
    <p>“Sounds like yall got plans, weh.”  He tries to give Cel a subtle elbow nudge.  It might be less subtle than he could have wanted.  “<smaller>Un</smaller><small>deux</small>trois! <span class="AcrisMagic">Tremper</span>!”  Acris is no longer in melee range.  Acris is able to cast his spell without difficulty.  Acris dumps a significant portion of water over the head of this Madcat individual.</p>
    <p>Acris then grabs Cel’s arm and turns to run.</p>
    <p>Cel spins and runs with him, taking the lead and pulling Acris back up the road, towards the tavern and the crowds surrounding it. She risks a glance back. </p>
    <p>The elf that had grabbed Acris is straggling; another pair of smoke-wrapped Fire Elves have joined up with him, but none of the three seem that eager to dash after the pair and towards the crowds on the main street. Madcat, however, is only a little behind them, and closing fast.</p>
    <p>The Howl is just ahead; customers leak in and out of the front door into an enormous clog of elves choking the road in front of it. Cel dives through the crowd, dragging Acris behind her and twisting through to safety of the doorway.</p>
    <p>A pair of hands close over their shoulders, pulling them both to a sudden stop.</p>
    <p>“<i>Celosia,</i>” Doukas says, looming over both of them. His eyes track down, to the look of fear on their faces, and then to the elf shoving through the crowds towards them.</p>
    <p>“Kahn,” Doukas says, his grip tightening on the kids’ shoulders.</p>
    <p>“Afternoooon, Lordship,” Madcat says, wiping water out of his hair with one hand. “See ya caught the kids’ve been pranking me. Youth in this city, huh? Up to all kinds of no good when left unsupervised.”</p>
    <p>“Uh-huh,” Doukas says quietly.</p>
    <p>“Got ssssome nice stains on your uniform, there,” Madcat says. “Shame you’re messing it up so soon after getting it. Better be careful; some don’t come out so easy.”</p>
    <p>Doukas glances down at Cel and Acris. </p>
    <p>“<small>Weh non, up to no good, that’s us, weh weh.</small>”  Acris mumbles quietly, trying very hard to somehow communicate the idea to Captain Doukas that they need an adult but without losing face in front of Cel.</p>
    <p>“Of course,” Doukas says, patting Acris on the shoulder, while turning a careful glare in Madcat’s direction. “Thank you for the tip, citizen,” he says quietly. “I’ll take these two to the station house myself, for a proper lecture.”</p>
    <p>“And leavvve the tavern unguarded?” Madcat grins. “Who’ll drink all of it while you’re out?”</p>
    <p>“It has plenty,” a young elf says, the crowd splitting around her. She’s clearly a few decades older than Acris and Cel, and has a ribbon of ash powdered around her head in a halo. A pair of elves in simple, numbered uniforms stand next to her, holding their bows loose under their arms.</p>
    <p>“Ashwalker,” Doukas says, nodding to her.</p>
    <p>“Legate-Captain,” Tsun replies. </p>
    <p>“And the Assshhwalker herself, huh?” Madcat says, still grinning. “Nice little party of the upper-crust we’ve got going here. You got ol’ Scary stashed in there as well, taking a drink?”</p>
    <p>“Go find out,” Tsun says. “<i>The Howl</i> is peaceful tonight. And will remain so.”</p>
    <p>“Think I’llll find a place where the booze is a little more free,” Madcat says, giving Tsun a sarcastic bow. “Be seeing ya, <i>Legate-Captain.</i> Gotta big name for yourself now. Little higher on the list.” The smoking elf turns, and lopes off.</p>
    <p>Doukas waits for Madcat to be some distance away, and then exhales. “Thank you, Ashwalker.”</p>
    <p>“That was a little bold, even for him,” Tsun says, stepping up to the three.</p>
    <p>“They’re always a little more bold when the Terror is out of town,” Doukas says. He glances at Cel. “And I suppose family troubles weren’t the only reason you snuck out for Fort Alfyr, were they?”</p>
    <p>Cel shakes her head, eyes downcast.</p>
    <p>Doukas grimaces. “Let’s get you both down to a station house,” he says. “We’ll talk about this there. Ashwalker?”</p>
    <p>“Accompanying,” Tsun says, nodding.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>“Sorry,” Cel says.</p>
    <p>They were sitting on a bench inside the ‘station house’ -- a squat stone building at the far end of the main street. The two of them had been rather forcibly wrapped in blankets, and mugs full of a hot, sticky liquid had been shoved into their hands by several concerned guards. Guards who were now lounging in the nearby hallway, hands at their side-swords. </p>
    <p>“S’okay,” Acris answers, kicking at the floor uselessly.  “It ain’t the worst trouble.”</p>
    <p>And then a river elf in a long damp cloak steps in the door.  She fixes Acris with an angry glare.  Rulyrana has come to collect the apprentice.</p>
    <p>“Or not.”</p>
