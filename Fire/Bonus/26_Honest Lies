<p>"What'll it be, stranger?"</p>
<p>Barrabus gave Tallflower a blank look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tallflower smirked. "Oh, its you, Barry!" he said. "Its been a long time since I've seen you in here."</p>
<p>"I was here last week," Barry said. His eyes narrowed. "I even sang the damn song."</p>
<p>Tallflower shook his head, still grinning. "No, no, that was clearly some other elf. I remember, 'cause he looked like he rotted through the bottom of the trashcart. Had the same hat, though."</p>
<p>"Har har," Barry said. "Get me some wine, you hack."</p>
<p>"No problem, milord," Tallflower said mildly, before ducking back around the bar.</p>
<p>Barry leaned back against the bar, propping one foot on the bottom of a nearby stool. Both bar and stools were new; Tallflower had entirely refurbished <em>the Howl</em> the previous year, in addition to stretching the main hall to twice its original length. And the Howl needed it. When Barry visited last week for some late night refreshment, the main hall had been standing room only, and the dance floor had been so full the heat left new scorchmarks on the ceiling.</p>
<p>But it was mid-morning, and the tavern was nearly deserted. The hall was a sea of empty tables, edged in sunlight streaming from the Howl's clerestory.</p>
<p>Tallflower bustled back to Barry's side of the bar and pushed a mug into his hand. "Have a taste," he said.</p>
<p>Barry swept the mug to his face, and gave it a pull. And choked.</p>
<p>"I said wine, Tallflower," Barry spluttered. "If that's what you thought this was, someone switched the berries in your brew for bees, old friend."</p>
<p>Tallflower rolled his eyes. "Just taste it, yah daft fop."</p>
<p>Barry shrugged, and took another sip.</p>
<p>It was mead -- very strong mead, Barry guessed, from the amount of pain suddenly speeding through his sinuses -- with a slightly sweet aftertaste, cut with hops and nutmeg. A trace of elderflower circulated through his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Is this..." Barry paused, savoring the last moments of flavor. "This is Halfcock's, isn't it? You were saving a bottle this whole time, you great bastard? Wonderful!" He gulped down another sip.</p>
<p>Tallflower laughed. "Not quite. It's called 'Honeyjack'; a couple of brewers from Disr hauled it down here last week. Said they were trying to recreate the old meads by half-freezing it and sifting out the ice."</p>
<p>"They should have just carved a bird on the bottle and sold it to you as old loot," Barry said, taking another sip, as a glow crawled its way up his cheeks. "I can't taste the difference. It's like I'm back at the Kicked Bucket, back home."</p>
<p>Tallflower frowned. "You... probably shouldn't call it that anymore, Barry," he said quietly.</p>
<p>Barry dimmed. "Sorry, Tallflower. I just don't know what to call i--"</p>
<p>"That'll be twenty marks, by the by," Tallflower said, suppressing the grin rising back over his face.</p>
<p>Barry laughed. "You literal con-man! I didn't even ask for this!"</p>
<p>"You're drinking it, though," Tallflower chuckled.</p>
<p>"And I'll be broke by the end of the week, if you're charging like that for it!"</p>
<p>"You, broke? Mister high-and-mighty Prince of Merchants? How much are you planning on drinking?"</p>
<p>Barrabus leaned over the bar, and stared Tallflower straight in the eyes. "How much you got?"</p>
<p>Tallflower laughed so hard the jug almost dropped from his fingers.</p>
<p>"I'm glad someone likes it," he said, recovering. "I can't sell it to anyone else; tastes too much of Lycan-drink for most palates around here. You're the second elf I've found that's actually willing to drink more than a taste of it."</p>
<p>"Who's the first?" Barry asked.</p>
<p>"Girl in the creepy old man corner, back there," Tallflower said, gesturing to the far side of the hall.</p>
<p>Barry squinted.</p>
<p>A figure sat hunched by a table in the far corner of the hall, on a bench angled just in front the sunbeam from the window above. Only her silhouette was visible from the front of the hall.</p>
<p>Her posture reminded Barry of a great cat, waiting to pounce. Based on the angle, he judged that her focus was on the door; she likely hadn&rsquo;t noticed Twoflower&rsquo;s gesture. Finally&hellip; something about the shape of her jaw struck Barry as familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; Barry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blade elf. Mercenary, if I had to guess; she talks a little differently than the Swordelves from Alfyr. She&rsquo;s been here a few times.&rdquo; Tallflower raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;If you were thinking of deploying &ldquo;the ol&rsquo; Leafstorm charm&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d reconsider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Leafstorm Charm is irresistible,&rdquo; said Barry, who was only halfway paying attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you said that when we were kids, too,&rdquo; Tallflower said. &ldquo;Right before you hit on that one warscholar -- what was their name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she been waiting here long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tallflower frowned. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been in that corner for a little while, yes. I thought she was just nursing her mead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry plopped himself onto the stool, and turned sideways towards the door, keeping the Blade Elf visible out of the corner of his eye. He shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>Tallflower gulped, and shoved the mead-jug back under the counter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tavern door swung open. And Fury swept through it.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a more conservative chiton than usual, and covered it with a lavender cloak, with its hood pulled down over the front of her mask. It was a rather poor attempt at a disguise, Barry thought. Her shoulders were hunched, and she had her arms crossed in front of her, wrapped around a plain leather bag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry saw her eyes track up to where the &ldquo;mercenary&rdquo; was sitting in the corner, missing him entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury forced herself to straighten up, and tossed her hood back, presenting the back corner of the hall with a friendly smile that Barry could only barely tell was forced. She then sauntered over to the far table, dropping carefully onto the couch opposite the Blade Elf, directly in the sunbeam from the window above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blade Elf whispered something. Fury replied, and dropped her bag onto the marble-topped table in front of her. The bag let out a loud clank, like a sack of coins dropped on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&hellip; is this a hand-off?&rdquo; Tallflower said to Barry, his eyes stuck on the table at the back. &ldquo;Some kinda bribe, or something? From <em>her</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said this mercenary had been in here a few times,&rdquo; Barry said quietly. &ldquo;Do you know where she works?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tallflower shook his head. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t said&hellip; but I listened to some Ashwalkers talking about a Blade Elf like her the other day. They said she came into town with the Hunger, just before he was arrested. Got into it with Tsun, or something like that.&rdquo; He leaned over the side of the bar, and squinted. &ldquo;Which means that Fury&rsquo;s trying to bribe her for something. Access? Keeping her quiet about something else? ...Maybe to keep her quiet about all the &lsquo;barking&rsquo; ol&rsquo; Hungry&rsquo;s doing on the side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry shook his head. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t look like a bribe, Tee,&rdquo; he said, as Fury shoved the bag over to the mercenary&rsquo;s half of the table. &ldquo;...Okay, mostly doesn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t see Fury trying to hide something like that; she&rsquo;s terrible at keeping secrets.&ldquo;</p>
<p>Tallflower gave Barry his patented &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a drunk moron&rsquo; look. As an experienced <em>Howl</em> patron, Barry ignored it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And anyway, look at the set of her shoulders!&rdquo; Barry continued. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not sneakily bribing a witness. She&rsquo;s terrified!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mercenary laughed -- a loud, clear ringing that struck Barry as definitely familiar. Fury shrank back, eyes wide, and toppled over the side of her couch, crashing to the floor in a tidal wave of sparks and curses.</p>
<p>Barry and Tallflower watched as Fury scrambled back to her seat.</p>
<p>"Bribery and fear aren't exactly mutually exclusive," Tallflower said. "But something's definitely going down. ...I think we should call the guards."</p>
<p>Barry gave him a sideways look. "On <em>her</em>."</p>
<p>"On <em>the</em> <em>merc</em>, damnit," Tallflower whispered. "You're the one that implied <em>she's </em>here under duress! What if that merc's threatening her?" He gasped. "What if she's one of the Hunger's werewolves?"</p>
<p>Barry rolled his eyes. "The Hunger's not a werewolf."</p>
<p>Tallflower paused. "You sure?"</p>
<p>"Very."</p>
<p>"Well, fine," Tallflower said. "But maybe this merc is. <em>Something's</em> been afflicting people."</p>
<p>"That would be&hellip;" Barry paused. The Fury had made it pretty clear that he shouldn't mention the Wolf Elves to anyone just yet. Was this why? Was the merc one of them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...Look, let's not jump to conclusions," Barry said, now uncomfortably the voice of reason. "Just&hellip; check on your staff, and make sure the back door is latched, and I'll get a little closer and snoop a bit."</p>
<p>Tallflower nodded. "...Don't get killed. Or wreck my tavern."</p>
<p>Barrabus swept his cape back, and pointed his nose in the air imperiously. "A mere werewolf is hardly a threat to me."</p>
<p>For a moment, Tallflower looked like he was going to argue about that.</p>
<p>For a moment, Barry wished he would.</p>
<p>Tallflower scrambled for the door behind the bar, glancing back towards the back table as he went.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry slipped around the side of the bar, and tip-toed over to the first row of tables, just below the light shining in from the clerestory. He thought a little about the Fury as he went, and what exactly she would be afraid of.</p>
<p>Unlike the Terror and the Hunger, the Fury was never known for being unflappable, or an unstoppable, fear-inducing monster on the battlefield. She had mostly stayed towards the back lines, serving more as a heal battery and friendly face, and occasionally a devastating artillery piece. But even so, to Barry (though he admitted to himself he might not have the most unbiased perspective), her suddenly timid reactions to this mercenary seemed&hellip; almost out of character for her. Like she was an understudy, playing a part she only barely knew.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Defiant to a fault&rsquo; is more her style</em>, he thought to himself. He smirked. <em>Especially the &lsquo;fault&rsquo; part. So why this?</em></p>
<p>He tucked below the nearest table, and scrambled carefully over to the next, keeping furniture between himself and his target as much as possible.</p>
<p><em>Why would the Fury not be defiant&hellip;</em> He paused. <em>Wrong way around</em>. <em>What could the Fury be defying right now?</em></p>
<p>He spun quickly around the next bench, and glanced back at his targets and their table.</p>
<p>Fury was laughing at something -- a sound that distinctly reminded Barry of &lsquo;home&rsquo;, the same way that elderflower mead and chatting with Tallflower brought back <em>the Kicked Bucket</em> as if it had only burned yesterday. He still wasn&rsquo;t sure why; if he had met a masked sorceress with a tendency to set everything on fire when he was young, he was certain he would have remembered it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mercenary leaned forward, slapping her mug onto the table, and held her hands in the air, about a pace apart. Fury laughed even harder.</p>
<p>Barry&rsquo;s eyes shot to the mercenary&rsquo;s face, now visible in the light from the window. He knew in an instant why the Fury had been so nervous.</p>
<p>There was a werewolf in <em>the Howl</em>.</p>
<p>He shot to his feet, and with practiced ease, forced himself into a debonair strut, sashaying his way over to the Fury&rsquo;s table. He affixed grin number eight -- &lsquo;smooth and stylish&rsquo; -- and hopped butt-first onto the table edge, positioning himself equidistant between the two elves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hello there,&rdquo; he said, turning to the &lsquo;mercenary&rsquo;. &ldquo;And how is my biggest fan doing on this beautiful Surtian day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>The blade elf looked from Barrabus back to Fury, &ldquo;You let him out in public?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried caging him,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;But he always oozes his way out eventually. Slimes are like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mercenary shrugged and took another swig of the mead, &ldquo;Have you tried a bucket?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A loud, low-pitched scream rolled out through the hall, from the direction of the kitchen doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phobe!&rdquo; Barry shouted. He jumped off the table, hand at his sword, darting sideways automatically to stand in front of Fury&hellip; and crashed face-first into the mercenary&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry staggered. The Blade Elf didn't even appear to notice. She had leapt to her feet, also planting herself between a potential threat and the Fury. She simply had more momentum. The merc gave Barrabus an annoyed look.</p>
<p>"I'm getting paid by the Triumvirate, not a barkeep. Your show."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry nodded. He dashed for the kitchen door, slowing to a tip-toe just before he reached it. He paused, and then quietly popped the latch, before sliding silently into the kitchen.</p>
<p>He stepped back out less than a minute later. &ldquo;You two might want to come see this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Or not. It's gross. We might want to call the guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The corpse was missing most of its throat, along with several more chunks along the arms and face. It was lying in a pool of blood, half-mixed with mead leaking from a nearby jug. Tallflower stood next to it; he was leaning over another elf, who was on his knees, staring with wide eyes at the body in front of him.</p>
<p>Barry made note of the chiton the victim was wearing. It was extra thick, cut long enough to drape over his knees, and dyed a cheap yellow color that was a &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; color for fancy clothing among Surt&rsquo;s poorer residents. It was almost identical to the chiton the other elf beside Tallflower was wearing (<em>aside from the bloodstains</em>, Bary thought).&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it did not match the uniform white-and-red of Tallflower and his kitchen staff, most of whom were now standing nervously around the back of the hallway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was like this when I found him,&rdquo; Tallflower said; despite being as pale and dim as a corpse himself, Barry noted, his voice was still clear and steady, and his eyes were on Barry rather than the body. &ldquo;Dexiter and Emil here,&rdquo; he gestured to the kneeling elf, &ldquo;were the two that developed that honeyjack. Said they were going to be bringing the rest of my order in this morning; I guess this happened as they were hauling the last of it inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m guessing no one saw anything?&rdquo; Barry said, glancing over at the kitchen staff. Tallflower had hired a half-dozen cooks and waiters to help him keep up with demand and prepare food for the lunch and dinner crowds.</p>
<p>Tallflower shook his head. &ldquo;They were all in the kitchen, and no one else should have been in the storeroom&hellip;&rdquo; He paused, staring, as the mercenary stepped in behind Barry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; Barry said, waving his hand. &ldquo;I know who she is now; we met at the potluck last season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tallflower raised an eyebrow, which Barry deliberately ignored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, she might have a few opinions on what happened here,&rdquo; Barry said. He turned back towards the merc. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve run into a few wild beasts in your travels, yes? What sort of creature could have inflicted this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the chefs -- a burly elf with a burnscar over her nose -- spoke up. &ldquo;Its a werewolf, isn&rsquo;t it? Or a werejaguar, maybe? Should be pretty obvious, with that neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"They would go for the back of the neck, not the front," the merc kneeled and examined the body, "They would also be more precise. This is a mess. Hmph. Wild beast indeed&hellip;"</p>
<p>She squinted at the bloody corpse, "Claw and bite wounds alright. Not a werewolf. Werewolves don't have claws like this. Wounds are savage and uncontrolled. Looks like an animal attack to me."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Jaguars are animals," the cook grumbled. "Still hearing werejaguar so far."</p>
<p>&nbsp;"No," the merc stood up from the body, "If it was a jaguar, it would have crushed his windpipe or cracked his skull. Preferentially dragging the victim to an elevated place to feed. It wouldn't leave good meat on the ground. Unless, of course, it was interrupted, in which case it'd flee to an elevated place and wait for its next victim. Hm." She raised an eyebrow and glanced at the shadowy rafters above the cook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cook quickly whirled to look above her with wide eyes. There was nothing.</p>
<p>"No, not a jaguar then." The merc chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whatever it was could still be in here, then?&rdquo; said one of the waiters, her eyes darting about the room. There was a thick coating of dust covering the front of her tunic. &ldquo;...We should call the guards! Get them to look through here for the were-- for the <em>animal</em> that&hellip; that&hellip; did that!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry nodded, glancing back towards the merc, and then to Tallflower. &ldquo;Indeed. But&hellip; no offense to your staff, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone who was in this area should leave just yet. It would increase suspicion on whoever did leave, to start with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tallflower nodded. &ldquo;Ye--yes. That would make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry smiled. &ldquo;In that case, just stay put. I&rsquo;ll return with the Constabulary in but a few minutes at most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dust-coated water raised her hand. &ldquo;Wait! Wait! Does it have to be you, umm, Lord Leafstorm, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I think we&rsquo;d all be more comfortable if you stayed with us, Barry,&rdquo; Tallflower said, giving Barry a familiar and uncomfortable look. &ldquo;You and your merc friend here. We&rsquo;re not exactly soldiers.&rdquo; A few of the staff members muttered agreement.</p>
<p>Barry suppressed a grimace, and deliberately avoided glancing up towards the rafters. &ldquo;Fair argument,&rdquo; he said, forcing himself to sound as pleasant and unconcerned as possible. &ldquo;Then it should be you, Phobos. Its your tavern, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving my people here alone,&rdquo; Tallflower said.</p>
<p><em>And if the monster shows up, you&rsquo;ll what? &lsquo;Cheat at cards&rsquo; it to death? </em>Barry thought to himself.</p>
<p>"You're not." The mercenary commented flatly. She unshouldered the sheathed sword from her back and planted it on the ground next to her. The narrow longsword made a significantly heavier <em>thud</em> than it should have.</p>
<p>Tallflower swallowed, his eyes fixed on the merc&rsquo;s sword. &ldquo;Fair point. But someone also needs to check the locks on the back, in case whatever did this tries to slip out. And someone needs to keep an eye on the front as well, &lsquo;til the guard can get here and seal us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand her your keys,&rdquo; Barry said, gesturing to the merc. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll check it while you&rsquo;re out. The Lady Fury can watch the front; I&rsquo;m certain she won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For reference, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Fury yelled, from just outside the door to the main hall.</p>
<p>Tallflower nodded. He pulled a loop of twisted metal bars from a satchel on his belt, and tossed them underhanded to the merc. &ldquo;Thank you, miss&hellip;&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She caught it with a smirk, "Don't bother. I <em>am</em> getting paid."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tallflower forced a smile. &ldquo;Pleasure to meet you, Miss Paid,&rdquo; he said. A few chuckles broke out from the band of kitchen workers. &ldquo;Keep them safe.&rdquo; He gave her and Barry a nod, and then dashed back through the door to the main hall.</p>
<p>Barry knelt down beside Emil, and gently placed a hand on the quivering elf&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Can you hear me, Emil?&rdquo; he said quietly, watching Emil&rsquo;s eyes and face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emil&rsquo;s eyes stayed fixed on the corpse in front of him. His fingers writhed, gripping at the bottom of his chiton, pulling and rending at it as if they were trying to tear it to pieces.</p>
<p>Barry glanced down.</p>
<p>Emil&rsquo;s fingers were stained red.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I hear you&rsquo;re for hire these days,&rdquo; Barry said, stepping up to the Howl&rsquo;s back door. He turned back down the hallway; the mercenary was walking down the corridor behind him, passing the doorway to the storehouse and the back entrance of the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So it seems," she spoke calmly but kept her eyes scanning, "It's Katya Vostok here, as tempting as going by 'Paid the Mercenary' is."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You charged right into that one,&rdquo; Barry said with a smile. He tapped his fingers against the mechanical bolt -- already locked -- and pulled against the chain wound around the doorhandle to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t loose. &ldquo;What if I were to hire you as a bodyguard for a few hours? Say, for a book signing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged, "I wouldn't mind. My primary career doesn't exactly pay well."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her tone grew more serious, "I wasn't completely truthful. Whatever did that was going for vitals. It had intelligence. No sign of affliction, but there wouldn't be if it killed quick enough. The staff is clean, as far as I can tell. So is Emil. None of them are afflicted."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry nodded. &ldquo;...We&rsquo;ll have to get you a white wig,&rdquo; he said, after a moment. &ldquo;And someone to dress up as the Hunger&hellip; perhaps a dwarf that is willing to shave? And&hellip; there&rsquo;s a lot of dust right around the door there.&rdquo; He gestured to the back door to the kitchen. &ldquo;On the handle as well&hellip; but that would take whoever it was right into the whole group, whereas our perpetrator went right past that door and down the hallway. Curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"The victim had pieces <em>missing</em>," Katya's voice was cold, "It is possible it was seeking out an isolated victim as prey."</p>
<p>She paused briefly, "A gnome might work better, if you could find one."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a smart beast might leave the body rather than leave a bloodtrail,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose gnomes are known for being bloodthirsty ambush predators, are they? I&rsquo;ve never met one, and that would be incredibly convenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something loud and heavy slammed into the back door.</p>
<p>Barry spun, pulling his machete from his belt. And then paused, as a series of smaller thumps hammered against the stonework around it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Someone is sealing up the back door,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;That&hellip; sounds like more effort than the Constabulary would normally put into a crime scene. Unless they really thought there was an afflicted on site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katya was already stomping towards the door. Without saying a word, she unlocked it, twisted the latch, and shoved her shoulder into it with a snarl. The door shuddered with a thud, but didn't budge. Katya rubbed her shoulder and muttered something about fur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry blinked. &ldquo;Do you&hellip; normally just shove through everything that stands in your way? If so, I&rsquo;m really jealous.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's worked so far," she growled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say the same thing about barding,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but when I try to <em>bard</em> my way through everything, people get all judgy.&rdquo; He twisted the door latch back into place, and started walking back down the hall to the main door. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to put your sword up. If they&rsquo;re sealing the back, I&rsquo;m guessing that means Phobos found the &lsquo;fun police&rsquo; rather than the Constabulary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I would say I don't know who you're talking about," she shouldered her sword with a sigh, "but I know <em>exactly </em>who you're talking about. Lead on, noble phoenix lord."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury was waiting for them at the end of the hall, and kneeling next to Emil, who still hadn&rsquo;t moved. &ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo; she said, as they came around the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few leads,&rdquo; Barry said mildly. &ldquo;And a barricade on the back door. Did our humble proprietor find the Terror when he was out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury sighed. &ldquo;No, someone found him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry gave Katya his patented, number one &ldquo;yep, who else would it be?&rdquo; look, and strode into the main hall. She rolled her eyes and followed.</p>
<p>A dozen fire elves stood around the center of the hall, clad in the greyed leather and fabric of the Ashwalker CP militia. Six more stood guard at the front entrance. Tallflower stood by one of the tables, looking a little dazed; he gave Barry an apologetic glance.</p>
<p>And by the bar, just in front of the door to the kitchens, stood Ashwalker Auburn Tsun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She gave Barry and Katya a disdainful once-over, and then turned back towards the assembled Ashwalkers behind her. &ldquo;Lord Leafstorm,&rdquo; she said; Barry couldn&rsquo;t see it, but he was certain she was rolling her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard you have an afflicted on site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or my friend Phobos Tallflower told you there&rsquo;d been a grizzly murder, and you immediately assumed there was an afflicted here because that&rsquo;s convenient for your image?&rdquo; Barry said.</p>
<p>The Ashwalkers standing around the main hall shuffled. Several of them grimaced. Katya muffled a single flat laugh.</p>
<p>Tsun turned back towards Barry, and opened her mouth as if to shout something, but then paused. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s skip the unnecessary banter, shall we?&rdquo; Tsun sighed. &ldquo;Show me the victim, so we can track down this Lycan and be done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right this way,&rdquo; Barry said, giving the Ashwalker audience the number 6 -- &ldquo;pleasant and not too cheeky, but definitely cheeky&rdquo; -- grin.</p>
<p>Tsun, Barry, and Katya stepped back into the hallway, and made their way over to the remnants of Dexiter. Fury and Emil were still beside it; Fury&rsquo;s eyes were focused on Emil, who still hadn&rsquo;t moved other than to wring his hands against his tunic. The remaining Praesidium members lined up around the bar, their hands on their weapons, while Tallflower moved up beside the kitchen doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Severe bite injury,&rdquo; Tsun said, leaning over the corpse. &ldquo;And defensive wounds along the arms. Missing chunks of flesh as well. And no one saw or heard anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tallflower shook his head. &ldquo;Not until Emil screamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tsun glanced over at the kneeling elf. &ldquo;Looks like an afflicted attack, Lord Leafstorm,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And one with a limited number of suspects, I&rsquo;d note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katya folded her arms and gives Tsun a hard look, &ldquo;Yeah, he looks like a real cold blooded killer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tsun gave Katya a hard look in return, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the only suspect in this building,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m curious as to what the Hunger&rsquo;s bodyguard is doing here in the middle of the day. Your employer is safe and <em>secure</em> in his home right now, correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, unless your guards aren&rsquo;t up to task, but hey, that&rsquo;s why I have a job, huh? Also, congratulations on finding a freshly paid mercenary in a bar. Brilliant deduction,&rdquo; Katya gives her a mocking salute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bar with two of the city&rsquo;s leaders in it,&rdquo; Tsun said. &ldquo;How convenient. And where were you when this was going on, mercenary? Drinking your profits <em>alone</em>?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell no,&rdquo; the merc snorted, &ldquo;I was drinking away my profits <em>with</em> the two leaders, because I went to the nicest bar in town, because I <em>got paid.</em> You haven&rsquo;t met many mercenaries, have you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t tend to last long,&rdquo; Tsun said. &ldquo;Interesting company you keep, merc. Two civil leaders <em>and</em> at least one accused werewolf. An interesting connection.&rdquo; She stepped around the sticky pool on the floor, and loomed over the body. &ldquo;And where were the three of you? In the kitchens? In a back room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the main hall, of course,&rdquo; Fury said, a noticeable glow tracing her face. &ldquo;Are you accusing <em>me</em> of something, Ashwalker Tsun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tsun glanced back at her soldiers, standing just outside the door. &ldquo;Of course not, your <em>grace</em>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But--&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Fury smiled. &ldquo;Emil needs medical attention. There&rsquo;s not a scratch on him, but he <em>is</em> clearly in shock. Soldier?&rdquo; She turned to one of the CP, who was standing by Tallflower, and half-glancing into the room. &ldquo;Would you be so kind as to assist me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, your grace!&rdquo; he said automatically, before glancing nervously back to Tsun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to carry poor Emil here to one of the benches,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;And then get him something to help calm him down. You and your friends look strong enough; come over here and give me a hand, while Tsun and Leafstorm look for our predator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me five minutes alone with him and I can find out what he knows,&rdquo; Katya commented, giving Fury a cool glance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <em>exactly </em>does that mea--&rdquo; Tsun started. Fury cut her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you carry him yourself?&rdquo; she said, looking at Katya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Katya nodded.</p>
<p>Fury glanced back to the kitchen door. &ldquo;Mister Tallflower, is there a closet by the main hall that our friend Katya can borrow, to help wake Emil up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tallflower nodded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the broom closet. It&rsquo;s not exactly big, but&hellip; keys on the ring I tossed you earlier. It&rsquo;s right by the table you were at. If that&rsquo;ll work for you, feel free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is she going to do? Bea--&rdquo; Tsun started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let Katya work, Tsun,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;I trust her completely -- why else would the Triumvirate have hired her to help dear Hunger make it back from the Potluck?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Fury,&rdquo; Katya said in a serious voice as she started to heft Emil, &ldquo;See, Tsun? That&rsquo;s why I was getting day drunk with my profits. <em>Networking</em>. Take notes.&rdquo; She paused, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re nervous, Fury can chaperone me. You trust <em>her,</em> right?&rdquo; Katya eyed Tsun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tsun glanced sideways at her soldiers. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said flatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be hurt if you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Fury laughed -- with impressive sincerity, Barry noted. &ldquo;You and Barrabus can interview the kitchen staff while Katya does her work. I&rsquo;m certain they&rsquo;d be reassured by your presence, and that will give you some time to look for clues, secure the exits, and&hellip; whatever else you do at crime scenes.&rdquo; She stood back up, and glanced at the mercenary. &ldquo;Katya, if you please. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not much help with&hellip; this sort of thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katya smiled as she lifts the shellshocked elf to standing, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I got all I need. C&rsquo;mon, you&rsquo;ll get a kick out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further ado, the mercenary started walking towards the improvised interrogation room, with Fury trailing behind her.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was spacious, for a broom closet. With the cleaning supplies out of the way, &ldquo;Katya&rdquo;- though Fury was still having trouble thinking of her as anything other than her real identity - was able to prop Emil up in a corner on a bar stool. The&hellip; <em>investigator</em> set her own bar stool up just a few inches from the&hellip; suspect? This was all kind of new for the Fury. So was being stuck in a confined space with someone who&hellip; no, don&rsquo;t think about that.</p>
<p>Fury cleared her throat lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip; not actually going to hurt him, right?&rdquo; She asked quietly.</p>
<p>Katya turned with a slight smile, &ldquo;Just watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mercenary - yeah, think of her like that - turned back to Emil. She put her hand on his chest with an open palm. She began to mutter something, then traced her hand across his chest in a few broad motions. Faint blue light illuminated the room very briefly as she traced a symbol on his chest. Fury blinked as she recognized the spell Katya was casting: <em>Calm Emotions.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Katya spoke as the spell took effect, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not afflicted. Just relax. I don&rsquo;t suspect you of anything. I know a victim when I see one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emil opened his mouth. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he whispered, his voice dry as dust.</p>
<p>"You're in a back room at the Howl," there was a gentleness in her voice that Fury hadn't heard before, "Your friend was attacked and killed. I am sorry. We want to protect you and make sure it does not happen to anyone else. If you can remember anything, it would help us."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came back to load the last box into Tallflower&rsquo;s storeroom,&rdquo; he said, his eyes staring at the floor. &ldquo;It was bigger and heavier than the boxes we brought in earlier, so it took both of us to bring it in. I remember&hellip; one of the kitchen staff was already unloading one of the boxes, and taking jugs up to the front. Heard the door to the store room slam open and shut a few times. I wanted to taste it up front -- one last shot of the good stuff for the road&hellip; to remember it by&hellip; and then the door slammed open and shut, and&hellip; Dexiter was behind me. I turned around, and he was frozen, as it tore into him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was trying to move his arms, but they weren&rsquo;t moving, and trying to say something, but his lips weren&rsquo;t moving&hellip; and I tried to pull it off him, but I wasn&rsquo;t moving&hellip; and then it dashed off. Way faster than it should have been able to move; it was too big to move that fast. And then I was on the floor beside him, and the jug I was holding hit the ground, and the door opened behind me&hellip; and then you were talking to me, and things started to make a bit more sense, I think. And I was here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Did you get a good look at it?" Katya asks quietly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&hellip; it was tall. Hairless. Wrinkled, like a dead tree. Like a statue in the ruins in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury glanced up. &ldquo;Wait. What ruins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruins Dexiter and I found. North of Pegasus&rsquo; Back. Old temples, of smooth stone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury shook her head. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen anything like that&hellip; though our scouting attempts haven&rsquo;t exactly been a success, I&rsquo;ll admit. But no old temples, or anything like that. You said they were north of Pegasus&rsquo; Back -- that&rsquo;s where we put our new village,&rdquo; Fury said to Katya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Highest mountain north of it,&rdquo; Emil said. &ldquo;We climbed all the way to the top, looking for something worth selling. And found the temples there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katya's eyes narrowed slightly, "You said 'one last shot to remember it by'... but Tallflower said you were making the honeyjack yourselves."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emil shook his head. &ldquo;Told Tallflower that to sell it to him. We&rsquo;re not brewers. We just&hellip; wanted to make some money. And there were all these jars of mead up there&hellip; dozens of them, stored away beneath one of the statues. Even tasted it, to make sure its good. We couldn&rsquo;t just keep them; they were covered in dust, looked old as Cal herself. We got our own jugs, poured the mead into them while we were still up there, and then hauled them back down. I remember&hellip; I thought I saw a few jugs we left up there, but Dexiter said he put them all away&hellip; and then we hauled them all straight here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You&hellip;" Katya made a growling noise and rubbed her temples, "You looted an ancient and mysterious ruined temple, stole booze <em>from under a statue</em> that was <em>somehow</em> still okay to drink&hellip; then just&hellip; <em>shoved them in boxes,</em> changed the labels, and hauled them down here to sell&hellip; and I've been <em>drinking it.</em>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought it was a good idea at the time,&rdquo; Emil said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury gave Katya a concerned look. &ldquo;Eww.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katya turns her head to Fury, "I believe we're not dealing with an afflicted. I have a theory&hellip;"&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you admit you followed the brewers into the tavern,&rdquo; Tsun said, glaring at the cook with the burn on her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, but not for more than a few steps,&rdquo; the cook replied. A few magenta sparks popped in at her feet. &ldquo;Like I said, it was the start of my shift, so I walked in behind them, closed up the door, and went into the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you ate before you got here, too, right?&rdquo; Barry said. He grinned.</p>
<p>The cook laughed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tsun turned, and gave Barry a glare that he completely ignored. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dismissed,&rdquo; Tsun said, turning back to the cook. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you back if we have further questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook nodded, gave Barry a quick salute, and stepped back into the kitchen, slamming the door behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She followed them in,&rdquo; Tsun said. &ldquo;And she was disrespectful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re disrespectful all the time,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s even arrested you for murder yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your attitude isn&rsquo;t helping, either, <em>Lord Leafstorm</em>,&rdquo; Tsun replied. &ldquo;Do you want to catch the murderer, or just delay me until your friend the afflicted can escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing afflicting that mercenary, Tsun, is a serious case of badonkadonk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tsun blinked, and then frowned. &ldquo;I--&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry stared at her. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t even sure what that means, are you?&rdquo; he said, grinning a little wider.</p>
<p>Tsun set her jaw. &ldquo;I have no doubt it is some loathsome, perverse descriptor, and proof yet again why no sane or rational mind would let you in polite society, let alone respect you enough to put you at the head of a legion of crony merchants -- except maybe that your rapacious actions would provide them cover to steal the livelihoods of the true inheritors of Muspelham!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its easy to forget, sometimes, how young you really are,&rdquo; Barry said, meeting her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare talk down to me, you flaming, foppish fr--&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Barry said, cutting her off. &ldquo;You spend so much time trying to get respect, Tsun, that you tend to miss when you&rsquo;ve already got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tsun stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you won&rsquo;t take my advice,&rdquo; Barry continued. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s never stopped me before, so I&rsquo;m giving it anyway. There&rsquo;s a reason people use &lsquo;good guard and bad guard&rsquo; when interrogating people; if you cut your vinegar with honey on occasion, you&rsquo;ll find it gets you a little further. And people tend to forgive the honey, and remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re advice?&rdquo; Tsun said. &ldquo;The &lsquo;honey&rsquo; in your metaphor is sex, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry shook his head. &ldquo;The &lsquo;honey&rsquo; of any conversation is respect. Take it from an expert. I&rsquo;m the best at what I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is it that you actually do, Barrabus Leafstorm?&rdquo; Tsun said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Survive.&rdquo; He glanced back to the door to the kitchen&hellip; and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Is this your strategy, Leafstorm? You confuse people until you get what you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re idiots,&rdquo; Barry whispered.</p>
<p>Tsun stared at him. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood doesn&rsquo;t disappear when a werewhatever changes back,&rdquo; Barry says. &ldquo;Not even a Lycan could just hide an attack by changing back. And no one in the kitchen would have had time to clean up -- there&rsquo;s six people in there, and not a single bloody rag in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re all covering for the killer,&rdquo; Tsun said, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And cleaned up the blood trail from the corpse, but left the body just lying there?&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;The only trail in here is this&hellip; dust on the handle of this door. Neither of the brewers are dusty, but there&rsquo;s some on the handle right here&hellip; but not a bit of blood&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the waitress carried the dust in from somewhere,&rdquo; Tsun said. &ldquo;Something in the back of their storage room, maybe?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or she opened something that was full of dust,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;Or something full of dust was open when she went back there. We&hellip; haven&rsquo;t actually looked inside the store room, have we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tsun shook her head.</p>
<p>"And you won't be doing that alone," Katya interjected as she walked up to the pair. She dragged a finger through the dust and sniffed it, the flicked it away with a disgusted face.</p>
<p>"I can't believe I didn't catch that&hellip; ugh. I <em>thought </em>I smelled something when I walked back here, but all the blood and meat must have covered it. Emil confessed that he didn't brew the honeyjack. He <em>stole </em>it from some kind of lost ancient temple <em>somehow.</em> He and the victim literally filled bottles with mysterious crypt hooch, put it in crates right there in the ruins, and hauled it back here to sell. One of them was heavier than usual, he said. This dust has been bugging me all day. Know what it smells like?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's death, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Barry said, nodding appreciatively.</p>
<p>"What else?" Katya answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found it it where?&rdquo; Tsun said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ancient ruins, north of Disr,&rdquo; Fury said, sweeping her hair back as she swept around the corner. &ldquo;Apparently, they were scavenging, and&hellip; well, the rest was a series of bad ideas chained together. Knowing our luck, they brought back a mummy or an exoskeleton or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door opens inward. I&rsquo;ll take the right side,&rdquo; Barry said, indicating the side closest to the hinges. &ldquo;Katya, you take the left. Tsun, stand a bit back and keep Fury covered; we&rsquo;ll need you to fall in after this thing, but we don&rsquo;t want it to charge right at her on us. We&rsquo;ll open on a count of three, and move in if we don&rsquo;t see anything. Sound good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can work with that,&rdquo; Tsun said, settling herself into a balanced position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your call, your lordliness," Katya unsheathed her sword and took up position next to Barrabus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then on three,&rdquo; Barry said, drawing his machete. &ldquo;One&hellip; two&hellip; three&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry grabbed the door latch, pulled it out, and kicked the door open with one foot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It flew back a total of three feet, before bouncing directly off the face of the thing standing behind it.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;thing&rsquo; had clearly been an elf once -- that much was obvious, given the pointy ears stemming from the side of its withered head, and the slender arms dangling by its side. It was also half a foot taller than Katya, completely hairless, and the same color as the grey dust scattered around the floor beneath it. Wet blood trickled from its claws and its open, fanged mouth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A smell leaked out from it -- sweet and cloying, like incense. Barry immediately felt his nostrils swell up and close.</p>
<p>It grabbed the edge of the door, and reached for Katya.</p>
<p>Barry grimaced unhappily. He leaned forward, ducking under the creature's long arms, and drove his machete deep into its chest. He hopped back, pulling the unnaturally sharp blade down and through as he went.</p>
<p>The creature stared down at Barry, confused, as its dessicated entrails dropped towards its knees.</p>
<p>Barry stared back incredulously. "You&hellip; going to fall over, there, buddy? Your intestines are spilling out there."</p>
<p>The beast shrugged.</p>
<p>"...Well then." Barry swallowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It swung a clawed arm for Katya. Katya leaned back, but not far enough -- the creature's claws caught her across the arm, leaving fingernail-like scrapes that sizzled briefly after contact. Another claw swept up, catching her just below the elbow, and leaving another trail of scrapes behind.</p>
<p>The merc leaned her head back and snarled as it snapped for her face. She grabbed the edge of her sword with her off hand and brought it up across her chest in a half sword grip. She lunged forward with a roar and cross checked the ghoul into the doorframe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She leaned her full weight into the heavy blade and twisted. With a crunch of bone and a splatter, she drew the full length of the sword through the creature's torso.</p>
<p>It toppled on two halves, crashing to the floor, arms and legs writhing in its dust and remnants. After a few seconds, it fell still.</p>
<p>Katya shook some of the gore and blood from her hands, suppressing a gag.</p>
<p>"<em>Mother Goddess</em> that's a stench."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No kidding," Fury said, covering her mouth with both hands. "What in Cal's reach was that thing?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a Ghast, a more dangerous form of a ghoul." Katya explained through a hand clamped over her mouth, "Damned good thing we got it, too. It can spread like a disease. Tell Tallflower he'll have to clean or burn anything it touched. Mother, we drank its <em>booze.</em>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry swallowed a little harder.</p>
<p>"Where was it hiding?" Tsun said.</p>
<p>Barry gestured to a large crate, sitting in the middle of the room. A few jugs poked out of the top, haphazardly stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>Fury shook her head. "I'll go and get Tallflower and a few guards to haul this thing out so I can burn it. Katya&hellip; looks like it tore your arms up a little. Do you need any healing? I don't want you to turn into one of these things, or something."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't mind," she looked at the wound then glanced at Tsun, "Never know when I'll feel a change upon me."</p>
<p>Tsun glared at her.</p>
<p>Fury smiled. "Hold still, please." She leaned back and put her hands together into a fan shape.</p>
<p>A wave of heat and light crawled its way up from her legs, over her face and hands, before shooting out in a cone of roiling fire, cascading through the color spectrum.</p>
<p>The scrapes on Katya's arms sealed immediately, leaving behind only a few thin lines&hellip; and a noticeable char on the tips of her hair.</p>
<p>Fury frowned. "...It doesn't normally char like that. Sorry." She grinned apologetically. "Guess I'm&hellip; more used to healing Fire Elves."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katya looked at the healed injuries with genuine awe. She dusted off the char and flexed her fingers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No&hellip; apology needed." She only just managed to keep her Katya voice going, "It even cleaned the gore off&hellip; I've never seen magic used like that. It&hellip; is impressive."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury smiled. "Glad to help!" She glanced back to the mess on the floor, and sighed. "I better get mister Tallflower so I can get started. Be back in a few!" And with that, she sauntered off.</p>
<p>"First time under the fire hose?" Barry said, glancing at Katya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes," she turned to begin cleaning her blade. She glanced at Tsun, then made a few quick swipes with a cloth before returning the blade to its sheath and dropping the stained cloth to be burned.</p>
<p>"I had heard what she can do, but seeing it in person is something else. It&hellip; tingles."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry nodded. "Creeps me out a bit, personally. Lots of poor memories associated with it."</p>
<p>"You don't sound very grateful," Tsun said. "And mercenary Katya&hellip; what was your last name again? I don't believe I caught it when last we met."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vostok,&rdquo; Katya turned to face her, &ldquo;And I believe I mentioned it. Several times.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Curious," Tsun said. "How did you know what this creature was? Or where the brewers'... <em>brought</em> it from?"</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked <em>nicely,</em>&rdquo; Katya folded her arms, &ldquo;And I read it in a book. You should try both.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She's got a point," Barry said mildly.</p>
<p>Tsun glanced at Barry curiously.</p>
<p>The door to the outside let out a sudden creak, as if something heavy had been torn from it. The latch shrieked, then snapped, as the door was torn open, revealing several Elves in heavy armor pulling at an attached crossbar. One of them -- the tallest -- immediately dropped the bar and stepped through the tavern's open door.</p>
<p>"So what's all this then?" Captain Doukas said, glancing down at the smushed ghoul on the floor.</p>
<p>"A crime scene," Barry replied. "Contains one dead ghoul, multiple witnesses, and a victim."</p>
<p>"And a Phoenix Lord, even," Doukas said. "What a surprise." He glanced at the Blade Elf standing over the corpse. And then took another look. "You look&hellip; familiar."</p>
<p>Katya glanced at him. For a brief moment, a look of recognition crossed her face before she stamped it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; she spoke flatly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I hear that a lot," Doukas said, staring at her armor. "Usually when it's not true."</p>
<p>"This is the Hunger's new bodyguard," Tsun said. "Katya Voukas, apparently."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vostok,&rdquo; Katra grumbles.</p>
<p>Doukas sighed. "If this is another of your political ploys, Ashwalker, I have no bloody interest."</p>
<p>"Honestly, not this time, captain," Tsun said, glancing at Barry. "And I apologize for dragging you into it. It seems a pair of brewers accidentally brought in a 'ghoul' with their shipment."</p>
<p>"Huh," Doukas said. "All right, then. Seems to be resolved -- how many casualties?"</p>
<p>"Just the one."</p>
<p>"Hmmph. With Leafstorm, that's practically a record low."</p>
<p>Katya raised a suspicious eyebrow at Barrabus at that comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry smiled mildly. "I lead an exciting life. Every day is an adventure."</p>
<p>"That would be the problem," Doukas said. He turned back to Katya. "I'm certain I've seen you before, but that name is not familiar."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katya sighed, &ldquo;Well, that is news to me. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We do need a witness statement," Tsun said. "You were the one that killed the beast. As well as the only one to recognize what it was. And to be official, it has to be under a magically enforced truth effect."</p>
<p>Doukas raised an eyebrow. "True. Would you be willing to submit to a truth telling effect, miss Vostok?"</p>
<p>"That isn't necessary," Barry said. "I'll make the statement for her."</p>
<p>"I think not," Doukas said. "I have to listen to you enough as it is."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; Katya&rsquo;s tone was level, controlled, and hiding anger, &ldquo;If you mean to interrogate me, don&rsquo;t be squeamish. You don&rsquo;t put someone under a truthtelling spell for a witness statement. Don&rsquo;t play games with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't play games, Vostok," Doukas said, eyes narrowed. "Should I take that as a 'no'?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I have an option, other than the obvious alternative?&rdquo; She glanced at Barrabus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yes," Barry said. "He's bluffing. He can't actually jail you unless he has something to charge you with."</p>
<p>"Other than have my men follow your every move until I get my answer," Doukas said. "Vostok isn't your real name, is it? I knew plenty of Vostoks back in Muspelham. <em>You</em> don't have their accent."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She paused and looked Doukas over, &ldquo;I am not your enemy, Captain Doukas. If you want to interrogate me, do it. If not, walk away. Your choice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still determining if I have reason to, Katya Vatik,&rdquo; Doukas said.</p>
<p>He turned away, and looked down at the mess of undead elf splayed across the floor. &ldquo;The false name was a good choice, but you should have paired it with a disguise. I am good at memorizing faces; it's a talent that has served me well, over the years. But even without it, I don&rsquo;t think I would forget the face of Artyom&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; His eyes went back to Katya&rsquo;s face, while his brow furrowed above them.</p>
<p>Katya had a look of unmasked surprise on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; she paused before answering, &ldquo;I&hellip; didn&rsquo;t think it wise to go by a name so closely associated with the Lycans and loyalists...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Triumvirate?&rdquo; Doukas asked. &ldquo;Are they aware of whom you really are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katya composed herself for a moment, glancing at Barrabus before answering, &ldquo;Yes. All three of them know my real identity. I told Hunger as much when he hired me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lord Leafstorm, as well, I take it,&rdquo; Doukas said. He shrugged. &ldquo;Good enough for me, honestly. Welcome to Surt, Skatisdottir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; Tsun said. &ldquo;She prac-- she&rsquo;s a former loyalist, she just admitted it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As were most of the rest of us, once,&rdquo; Doukas said firmly. &ldquo;Artyom was a good soldier -- one of the best. And the war is over, Ashwalker. Time to put some of the old grievances to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Please don't call me a Skatisdottir," Katya quietly asked Doukas. She turned to Tsun with a grim expression, "Tsun&hellip; my family is dead, murdered by Dreyrugr in the infighting near the end. The empire is gone. There is nothing left for me to be loyalist <em>to</em>. I am merely another lost elf, like everyone else here. The Triumvirate knows I'm here. So does Indrek. He gave me the papers, and a pardon. Now you know too. My old life is dead and gone. All I want is&hellip; to&hellip; not die with it." Oddly, Barrabus noted she seemed to struggle with those last words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doukas frowned. &ldquo;...My apologies, miss Vatik&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surt is not required to recognize any pardons from the&hellip;&rdquo; Tsun started.</p>
<p>Barry raised an eyebrow at her. &ldquo;You probably shouldn&rsquo;t push that, Tsun,&rdquo; he said, gesturing to the look on Doukas&rsquo; face. &ldquo;Best drop it, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tsun growled. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t turning out the way you suggested, Leafstorm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry shrugged. &ldquo;Worked for her. You just need more practice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katya gave Tsun another look, but returned her gaze to Doukas&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You have nothing to apologize for, Captain," she gives him a respectful blade elf bow, "You were doing your duty, and executing it well. I would expect no less."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doukas returned the bow crisply. "And now I must take my leave, I'm afraid. Seems I have another of Leafstorm's adventures to clean up." He turned and walked down the hallway towards the main hall.</p>
<p>Tsun glared at Katya. "Be on your best behavior, <em>loyalist</em>. Not all of us are quite as forgiving as the captain."</p>
<p>"And the Fury, and the Hunger, and myself, and the Terror, and Tallflower probably--" Barry said.</p>
<p>"Yes, thank you, Leafstorm," Tsun snapped. "You've been very helpful."</p>
<p>"Then a piece of advice to you," Katya took several steps toward Tsun, stopped, then stared her straight in the eyes, "Let sleeping dogs lie."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They're pretty good at it, honestly," Barry muttered.</p>
<p>Tsun backed down first. "Fine," she said. "But we will be watching you." She turned, and stormed out through the open door to the back.</p>
<p>Barry glanced at Katya. "Don't mind her; she's going through a phase." He glanced back down the hallway, and then nodded to himself. "Can I buy you a drink?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katya made a huffing noise and gave Barrabus a sideways look, &ldquo;I have a girlfriend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry shrugged. "Invite her to come along. As long as it's not mead, I'm good with whatever."</p>
<p>Katya snorted back a laugh at that, "Hedging your bets much, bard?"</p>
<p>"It&rsquo;s the best way to get by," Barry said. He took a few steps towards the main hall. "Tell your girlfriend Fury that drinks are on me, if you like. I need to get the taste of ghoulmead out of my mouth."</p>
<p>Katya blinked, then burst out laughing.&nbsp;</p>
