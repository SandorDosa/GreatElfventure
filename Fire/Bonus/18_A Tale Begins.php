    <h1>A Tale Begins</h1>
    <p id="i">“Acris you lil’ peeshwank, git back here!”</p>
    <p>Smilisca’s voice boomed across the courtyard at Fort Alfyr. Half a dozen off-duty blade elves chuckled at the panicked apprentice as he sprinted across the courtyard with the <i>plap plap</i> of river elf feet, desperately trying to wipe the ink stains off his robe. He beelineed for one of the service entrances, trying to get there before his mentor sent him flying with a water spell.</p>
    <p>He managed to fly through the back door and slam it shut right as a jet of water fired through the gap. He threw his weight against it and latched it shut. Of course, he didn’t stop to catch his breath. An angry wizard can’t be stopped by a simple locked door.</p>
    <p>Acris threw himself through the blade elves on kitchen duty, ignoring both laughter and cursing in equal measures. He scrambled for one of the back hallways and kept running. He sprinted down a back hallway and rounded a corner at full speed without bothering to look where he was going. </p>
    <p>A lanky elfling rushed in front of him, darting out of the way just before impact, and skidding to a stop against the far wall. </p>
    <p>“Watch it, Rupert! You almost ran straight into me!” </p>
    <p>She was taller than Acris -- three inches by ears alone -- and dressed in a set of Blade Elf training armor that was frayed and burnt at the edges. She had a dinnerplate and metal cover propped up against her hip; her other hand rested on a training sword dangling from her belt. </p>
    <p>The elf glanced back down the hallway she just came from. “Where’re you going, anyway?” she said, without looking at him. </p>
    <p>Acris knew that he did not have time to talk.  But Acris also didn’t want to be in the habit of bothering people with swords.  He pointed back the way he came with bright blue ink stained fingers.</p>
    <p>“Can’t talk, angry wizard.”</p>
    <p>And then he took off again, <i>plap plap plapping</i> away.</p>
    <p>The elf blinked. “Hey, now, wait a minute!” she said, dashing after him. “I need to borrow you!” </p>
    <p>“Que?”  Acris stumbled and rebounded off a wall with the distraction. “Que weh que?  What for?”</p>
    <p>“Reasons,” she said, glancing up and down the hallway. “Besides, you’re not doing anything important.” </p>
    <p>Acris eyed her with suspicion, but then looked down into his inky hands.</p>
    <p>“Weh, yeah, can’t argue tha’.”  He grabbed her wrist and pulled her down the hall after him.  “Mais!  Gotta keep movin, he’ll catch up ‘ventually, an then yanno,<i> angry wizard</i>.”</p>
    <p>“Angry <i>wizard</i>, you said,” she replied. “Why’re we even running? He’s just gonna teleport right behind you. And anyway, let’s go back to the kitchens; I’ve got to drop this off before Terje figures out I ran down this hallway.” </p>
    <p>“Oh non, non non non, not Terje too!”  Acris pivoted to push her in the direction of the kitchen instead.  “Aight, do the thing an’ then we git gone.  Master Nonc’s gotta know where y’are to teleport t’ya, so et buys time t’ cool off a bit.  Then gon’ be cleanin’ oyster shells n scrubbin’ the live well only two months ‘stead of eight, weh?”</p>
    <p>She grabbed his arm. “All right, but you’re coming with, Rupert. Can’t have you running off instead of staying put so I can borrow you. Just stay out of sight, around the corner, and I’ll let you know if there’re any wizards in there.” </p>
    <p>“Acris.”  He corrected her, petilly, but also nodded to agree to the terms.</p>
    <p>“‘T’s not a name, it’s a descriptor.” </p>
    <p>She dragged Acris back over to the edge of the kitchens, and then tip-toed carefully through the doorway. </p>
    <p>The elves on duty were bustling through the kitchen, cleaning plates and emptying out leftovers from the midday meal that had finished less than an hour previous. None of them spared a glance for the youth in training garb at the back.</p>
    <p>The elfling walked quietly over to the “dirty plates” pile, and set the plate she held just to the side of it, keeping the cover tightly closed, before scattering a few dirty spoons over top of it. She then walked briskly back towards the hallway, whistling quietly to herself.</p>
    <p>“All done,” she said, stepping back around the corner. “No sign of wizards.” </p>
    <p>“Sorry bout that blue, weh...”  Acris shrugged, focusing on the taller elf’s hands.  “...Mais whatchu need me for?”</p>
    <p>The elf smiled. “How’s your swimming?”</p>
    <p>Acris shrugged again, like he’d developed a twitch.</p>
    <p>“I ain’t gon’ drown, non.”</p>
    <p>She clapped her hands together. “Good! We’re going on an adventure.”</p>
    <p>He eyed her suspiciously.  And waited a second, so he wouldn’t seem too eager.  It was a ruse.</p>
    <p>“Aight!”  He grinned widely, and gave her two very bright blue thumbs up.  “So what’ser name anyway, weh?”</p>
    <p>From the other side of the kitchen, Terje’s voice could clearly be heard talking to the staff significantly louder than usual, “Alright, who’s seen Cel?” </p>
    <p>The elf’s grin wavered a bit. “That’s our cue to leave,” she whispered. “Pleased to meet you.” </p>
    <p>"<i>YOU!</i>" Terje's voice boomed across the room, accompanied by the sound of scattering pots and pans as he rampaged across the room.</p>
    <p>"Yep!" Cel didn't wait for a reply before grabbing Acris by the collar and fleeing for the exit.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>She came to a stop four halls and several doorways later, at the edge of a fountain in one of the fort’s smaller courtyards.</p>
    <p>“Sorry about that,” she huffed, dropping onto a stone bench. “Quartermaster’s and I had some disagreements about ‘requestioning’ that I had to handle.” She pulled her training coif off her head, revealing a pile of orange-red hair, tied off in a short ponytail. “...What was your wizard after you for, anyway?” </p>
    <p>Acris held up his webbed hands, both stained with bright blue ink.  It reflected a darker green sheen where additional ink had collected in the creases of his palms.</p>
    <p>“Et spilled,” the apprentice answered, probably not including enough detail to be entirely honest.</p>
    <p>Cel cocked her head. “‘Ts not really enough to chase you through the halls, there, is it? Just from spilling some ink? Looks like the kind of thing that happens to Ruperts all the time. Always got their hands stained in ink and such. Practically standard issue.”</p>
    <p>With some small amount of pride, Acris picked a spot on the wall, pointed at it with a dramatic flair, and cast his band new spell.</p>
    <p>A ray of cold energy fired off out of the hand that was not pointing at the spot on the wall, and instead it flashed down the hallway, ricocheting off the ceiling and finally hitting a potted plant.  The plant immediately grew a coat of frost, as though it were left outside on the coldest night of the year.</p>
    <p>“Weh, meant to do that.”  Acris slicked back his hair, leaving a blue streak behind his webbed palm.</p>
    <p>Cel nodded, clearly impressed. “Nice shot. Tricky, too; don’t think anyone’s going to expect the shot out of the other hand. Catch ‘em by surprise.” </p>
    <p>“Weh!” Acris agreed, very much unsuccessfully hiding his embarrassment.  His ears flushed a dark green, making his grey spots stand out even darker than normal.  “‘Parently, th’ scroll I done found were supposed to be an Elfmas gift.  Mais, et shoulda been hid better if’n ya ask me, weh.”</p>
    <p>"So it was going to you anyway?" Cel said. "Now that's just unfair. You were just getting an early start; nothing wrong with that. Ambitious, even.</p>
    <p>"...And that's why we're going on an adventure," Cel said. "There's an old armory under the fort. It's been sealed up, and is a little flooded, but I'm pretty sure I know how to get in. And you can swim, so the water won't be an issue."</p>
    <p>“Mais, so we go int’a a sealed up armory full’a Cal-knows-what, an see what we ken find?”  Acris paused contemplatively.  “Perfec’ hidin’ place.  Let’s go!”</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The pair stood at the entrance to the only way into the armory - at least according to Cel. The old storm drain on one of the far corners of the practice yard once had a metal grate, but it had long since rusted away.</p>
    <p>The worn stone entrance to the drain was just wide enough for a single skinny elf to wiggle through. Inside it was almost pitch black dark.</p>
    <p>Through the narrow beam of sunlight entering the drain, the pair could see it was almost full of a slow but steady flow of water, with only a few inches of air at the top.</p>
    <p>"So there we go," Cel said. </p>
    <p>“Aight, let’s do dis,” Acris enthusiastically replies in a very quiet non-whisper.  He glanced around the practice yard to make sure they were not being watched, and then slipped into the water very much more quietly than the <i>plap plap plap</i> of his previous retreat would suggest he could be at all capable of achieving.</p>
    <p>Cel grimaced. “There’s nothing swimming in it, is there? Like, a horde of angry piranhas, just waiting for someone to provide some legs to chew on? Or an awker ooze, ready to pull us under once we get in?” </p>
    <p>“Non,” Acris’s reply came with a gush of bubbles.  He gave her two thumbs up, blue ink trailing through the water behind them like a magic aura.  “Nobody here but us gators.”  He waggled his ears at her playfully.</p>
    <p>Cel forced a smile. “...Still pretty gross stuff though,” she said. “Fire’s much more natural.” </p>
    <p>She checked to make sure her arming cap and training sword were tied into her belt, and then sat down at the drain’s edge, knees close to her face, and slid into the pipe with a splash. </p>
    <p>Her eyes widened. “Its freeeeezing,” she whispered loudly, teeth chattering, holding her head just above the edge of the pipe. A yellow-orange glow rolled out from her legs and face, lighting up the drain like torchlight, and revealing a long tunnel lined with decades of algae and dirt. </p>
    <p>She ducked her head down below the water’s edge,  and pushed herself forward with her feet, leaving a trail of mutilated algae in her wake. </p>
    <p>Acris handed her the tail end of his scarf so they would not be separated.</p>
    <p>The light from Cel's magic flickered and distorted with the flowing water. Even with the spell, it was practically impossible to see. She was just barely able to keep an eye on Acris' back as they made her way down the tunnel. She held onto the scarf for dear life.</p>
    <p>After ten or fifteen feet, she saw the narrow silvery band of air at the top of the tunnel start to disappear. She took a quick breath of the air in the gap. Acris was going forward, and no way was she letting go of the scarf. She held her breath.</p>
    <p>Acris continued to lead them down the storm drain, further into murky darkness. Cel's lungs began to hurt, and she was starting to wonder if she was an idiot. Suddenly, Acris swam upwards.</p>
    <p>Cel clung to his ankle as he bobbed up. After just a few seconds, he grabbed her arm and tugged her up too.</p>
    <p>She broke the surface with a gasp, and her feet found purchase on stone. She clambered up the drain exit and into the lost armory.</p>
    <p>Once she stood, the water was only about ankle deep. Her light illuminated a part of the crumbling basement. The ceiling had collapsed in places. It was held up with wood beams or fresh concrete pillars in places. The only sound was the dripping of water.</p>
    <p>There were old wooden weapon racks that Cel could see just inside the light spell, but they were rotted heaps of wet spongy uselessness. The only weapons on them were rusted so badly she couldn't even tell what they were supposed to be. </p>
    <p>Cel took a few careful steps over to the racks, looking for anything that might have fallen behind them, or scattered onto the floor. She frowned. “Well, butt.”</p>
    <p>She glanced back at Acris, still in the drain. “There’s got to be more in here. That was the end of the drain, right? Maybe we just need to find a spot the water isn’t draining into.” </p>
    <p>Acris, pretending not to be shivering in the cold water, disappeared into the drain to double check.  After a few minutes of playing it cool down in the dark, he popped back up to report on what was found. “Nothin’.”</p>
    <p>“There’s got to be more in here, then,” Cel said. “Another passage, away from the water.” </p>
    <p>She took a few steps parallel to the racks, scanning around them for passageways or gaps that might have once been a door. She shivered. Steam trailed off of her shoulders. </p>
    <p>Acris was convinced that he was too cool to be cold.  He joined Cel in looking around the room for potential secret doors or places the collapsed ceiling might have cut off.</p>
    <p>The pair slowly slogged through the flooded basement. All they saw was more collapsed ceilings and rotten, useless weapon racks. Cel huffed in frustration.</p>
    <p>Suddenly Acris froze. He felt something. Through the surface of the water, he felt an unmistakable tingle. Something moving. Something close.</p>
    <p>"<i>Cel-</i>" is all he managed to squeak out before something black and ugly threw itself at her out of the water.</p>
    <p>A rat the size of a small dog lunged from out of the water. It latched onto Cel's shoulder and twisted, tearing a large gash through her quilted arming coat.</p>
    <p>"Owwwww!" Cel yelled.</p>
    <p>She spun around and swung wildly with her wooden sword. Somehow, she managed to roll the rat off her shoulder and connect to it in midair.</p>
    <p>With a <i>thwack</i>, the huge rat was hurled right at Acris. Snapping and squealing, it bounced off Acris. It hissed and snapped towards his face.</p>
    <p>Acris let out a somewhat unmanly noise and shoved the rat away from him. He stumbled back, tripping and falling on his butt in the cold water. He somehow managed to shriek out the spell and point his finger at the rat.</p>
    <p>The rat squealed and hurled itself at him. He somehow managed to hit the rat dead center in its pink little nose.</p>
    <p>A thin coat of ice muffled the rat's squeal. The sound trailed off as it hit the water. After a couple seconds, the rat surfaced. It was completely limp.</p>
    <p>It smelled bad. It wasn't even a dire rat. It was just a really big regular one. </p>
    <p>Cel looked at the dead rat, then her shoulder, and then at Acris.</p>
    <p>“...I think I got bit by a wererat!” she said, horror and excitement roiling across her face. She slid her sword back through the knotted rope on her belt, and wiped a hand over the rip in her shoulder. “Got me good, too,” she said, with a bit of glowing red blood dripping from her fingers. “Look at it -- its huge!”</p>
    <p>“Cher, I don’ think that’s a wererat,” Acris poked the frozen corpse with a toe, “mais, I ken give you a spell that’ll help maybe?”</p>
    <p>“Course it’s a wererat, Acris,” Cel said. “Look at it! Its enormous. Plus, its hanging around in an old Lycan armory; I bet there isn’t a self-respecting normal rat out there that would be caught dead in a place like this.” She untied the top of her sleeve, just under the shoulder, and rolled it off her arm. “A spell would be great, though, if you please,” she said. “When you’re done, I’m gonna cauterize it.” </p>
    <p>She reached behind her, and pulled a thin torch from the satchel on her back. </p>
    <p>Acris suppressed a shrug.  Cool dudes don’t have a twitch problem.  He poked Cel in the shoulder and cast a simple <span class="AcrisMagic">Resistance</span> spell.</p>
    <p>“If’n you go all ratty we’ll git you cured, weh.”  He attempted to sound confident and reassuring.</p>
    <p>Cel shrugged. “I’d prefer that. Or I could go to the Hunger, and make him train me on how to be a Good Lycan. Back home, there are all kinds of rumors that he’s one.” She brought the end of the torch up to her mouth, and breathed a stream of white sparks over the head until it ignited. She then smacked it against the wound in her shoulder.</p>
    <p>A stream of smoke roiled out from it -- most of it stemming from the edge of her training armor, which blackened and crinkled from the heat of the torch. A thin layer of blood rolled into the wound, as if attracted by the heat, forming in seconds into a thick scab the color of ash.</p>
    <p>Cel nodded to herself, and dipped the torch head into the water beside the frosted rat, before sliding it back into her satchel. </p>
    <p>“He ain’t a Lycan,” Acris said absently, almost to himself.  He stared in fascination at the process of healing the injury.  “The Wolf’s a real Lycan.  An she ken cure th’ Affliction.”</p>
    <p>Cel cocked her head. “I definitely heard he was a Lycan. Or at least Afflicted or something. Who’s ‘the Wolf’?”</p>
    <p>“Uh...” Acris realized he doesn’t actually know her name.  “She a mysterious Lycan that done come outa th’ hills an helped at th’ Battle of Riverbend.  She’s a good Lycan.  Real helpful like.”</p>
    <p>Cel’s brow furrowed. “White fur? Really loud?”</p>
    <p>“Weh, she’s got white hair.  Ain’t heard a peep outa her though.  Quiet like fish like.”  He nodded, proud of how much he knows, and happy to finally have someone that’s actually interested in hearing what he had to say to talk to.</p>
    <p>“Can’t be the Tourist, then,” Cel said. She tapped her chin. “Must be a sister, or a Good Twin, or something.” Her eyes brightened. “...So you think she could train me to be a Good Lycan? That’s a lot more appealing than being executed, I’ve gotta say.”</p>
    <p>“Non, cher,” Acris grinned wide, “she done fix you up so you ain’t gotta be a wererat.”  And then he stopped to ponder a moment.  “Unless I guess you want to be a wererat?  Mais, that sounds awful.  Livin in stinky sewer water, eatin garbage, talkin’ to other rats.”</p>
    <p>Cel frowned. “I mean… I wouldn’t <i>have</i> to live in the sewers and eat garbage like the other wererats, though. I’d just be… you know… able to turn into a rat. Be sneakier, and even harder to catch. And I’d have a Dark Secret, like most good heroes in stories.”</p>
    <p>“You ain’t gotta git bit to be able to turn inta animals.  I seen Oarmaster Staruois turn inta all kindsa things.”  Acris shook his head and started to look around the room again.  “An if’n you don’t git cured, then they <i>foh shore</i> gon’ kill ya.  Ain’t no Afflicted git to just be left wanderin’ round.”</p>
    <p>“Wouldn’t be much of a Dark Secret if they weren’t going to kill me for it,” Cel said mildly. “See anything?” </p>
    <p>The two elves squinted in the flickering light. Back in a corner of the room, they saw a small hole in the wall lines with shredded wood and what looked like parchment. Inside, they saw something shiny glittering. </p>
    <p>Cel glanced over to Acris. “...We should probably try to sneak, just in case. Back me up.” She tip-toed over to the corner, keeping close to the edge of the weapon stands. </p>
    <p>Nothing jumped out as she slowly approached the old rat nest. It had been dug into the wall. Inside, she saw what looked like an old wooden case with brass fittings jammed into the dirt. </p>
    <p>“Hey Acris,” Cel whispered. “Can you detect magic? I think that’s a thing wizards do.”</p>
    <p>Acris was not capable of casting <i>detect magic.</i>  Acris was, however, able to cast the much less useful spell, <i>read magic.</i>  Acris did not, at this time, feel that it was appropriate to explain the differences between the two.</p>
    <p>Acris also, was not exactly paying attention when Cel mentioned sneaking.  He plapped over to the rat’s nest and poked the thing inside.</p>
    <p>The case was old, worn, and trapless. It also appeared to not be a mimic, illusion, or cursed artifact. It remained unmoving and inanimate at Acris' touch. The remains of a wax seal were visible on the edge of the case. </p>
    <p>Cel leaned closer to the edge of the nest, and grabbed the edge of the case with both hands. She then slowly pulled the case out of the dirt, covering the wax seal with one hand to keep it from falling apart. </p>
    <p>Acris checked behind and under where the case had been buried, just in case.  He attempted, very briefly, to see if any of the parchment had anything interesting written on it.</p>
    <p>The case yanked free from the dirt with a shower of wet soil. Unfortunately, the seal crumbled under Cel's hand. In the shredded parchment around the rat nest, Acris saw what might have once been arcane sigils on the parchment. </p>
    <p>Cel winced. “Hope that wasn’t important.” She ran her fingers along the edge of the case, searching for a latch or hook. There was a simple latch on the edge. She flipped it and opened the case.</p>
    <p>Inside, set in place neatly with wooden blocks, were several rolls of Lycan nickles, a pile of old moldy parchments tied with twine, and one well-worn looking gladius, with a light patina of wear on it. </p>
    <p>Cel’s eyes went wide. “Whoa,” she said, grabbing the sword by its hilt, and pulling it carefully out of the case and up to her eyes. The handle rattled in her hand. The fittings were worn and the wood rotten, but the high quality Lycan steel looked solid.</p>
    <p>Acris attempted to line up the edges of the torn parchment mournfully.</p>
    <p>“Take a look at these,” Cel said, holding out the case. “I bet the parchment roll in here has magic in it. You’d keep scrolls where you’d keep swords, right? Just in case you need them both when your fort’s under attack.” </p>
    <p>Most of the pages were long decayed, but at the very bottom of the stack one was apparently protected by the others on top of it. Acris delicately removed the fragile page. It was covered in Lycan runes that were quite clearly arcane in nature. </p>
    <p>Cel tucked the case under an arm, and then gave the sword’s hilt a close inspection, checking for hidden compartments or clever devices -- but mostly expecting to find wood rot and water damage. Satisfied, she carefully tucked the blade into the rope at her belt, wrapping it tightly against her training sword. “Hope you got something good, because I certainly did,” she said.</p>
    <p>Acris was completely prepared for this.  He sat down on the most sturdy looking pile of junk available, and actually used <span class="AcrisMagic">read magic</span> for its intended purpose.  He investigated the scroll in front of him, reading the arcane Lycan runes with skill.</p>
    <p>With his cantrip to translate, the runes fell into an organized pattern easily. They were simple and straightforward, but also quite effective at communicating their purpose. It was a scroll of <i>magic missiles.</i></p>
    <p>“Weh, Cel?”  Acris asked, concern in his voice, “You know any other way outa here?  I cain’t git this wet.”</p>
    <p>Cel grimaced. “To be honest… I wouldn’t have suggested the tunnel if I did. It was pretty gross. ...There’s probably another way out, though, I bet. Just gotta find it.” </p>
    <p>The pair slowly made their way through more of the collapsed basement. It took them several minutes of carefully picking through the flooded and unsafe rubble before Acris spots something. At the far end of the basement, around a long corner he spotted a thin beam of light coming from a corner in the ceiling. </p>
    <p>Acris pointed out the light to Cel and suggested that they head that’a’way.  He offered the lady elf a boost up to it. There was a narrow gap in the ceiling, an old crack. She could see the sky on the other side.</p>
    <p>Cel took it, scrambling for the edge of the crack. She made it all of halfway up before slipping neatly out of Acris’ grip, tumbling off of his shoulders and face-first into the trickle of water still flowing out of the drain. </p>
    <p>Acris stumbled on the slick stone floor as Cel’s weight rolled off of him, toppling seconds later onto her back, butt-first.</p>
    <p>Cel yelped, and rolled back out from under him. “Totally Rupert’d that one,” Cel said. She coughed. “Sorry, that’s my bad. Your papers all right?” </p>
    <p>Acris nodded.</p>
    <p>Cel tried again -- hoisting herself onto his shoulder, and leaping for the crack. This time, she caught it perfectly, her fingers digging into the crumbling stone around it. She tried to shimmy into the crack, dislodging chunks of stone and dirt onto Acris’ head, but instead had to settle for propping a leg up against the wall and slowly hoisting her way through. </p>
    <p>She pulled herself up through the hole awkwardly and levered herself onto the grass off the courtyard. She rolled into a sitting position and looked around. Her eyes went wide. Extremely wide.</p>
    <p>“Well, hello there Cel.”</p>
    <p>Sitting on a bench, no more than five feet from the hole was none other than Grandmaster Ehra Indrek, who was currently giving her one of those wry grandfatherly smiles he had. </p>
    <p>Cel snapped off a hasty salute. "Afternoon, sir!" she said. "You… don't happen to have a rope on you, do you?" </p>
    <p>"Afraid not,"  he returned the salute, but his eyes narrowed slightly, "There's blood on you coat, are you alright?" </p>
    <p>Cel grinned nervously. “Oh, that,” she said, glancing down at her armor. She quickly wiped at the bloodstains with her fingers, completely ignoring the dirt, muck, and mud surrounding them. “Just a rat bite, sir. Really large one; very aggressive. ...Were you planning on being here for a while, sir?”</p>
    <p>"Well, I managed to lose Siiri, so I was thinking about staying here so I could have a moment to myself. Plans change, however. Why did you need a rope?" </p>
    <p>An unhappy scrabbling sound echoed up from the crack in the courtyard grounds. </p>
    <p>“...Well, to be honest, I was going to wait for you to leave,” Cel said. “But I don’t think Acris can wait super long. Those rats were pretty huge.”</p>
    <p>"<i>Acris?</i>" Ehra raised his eyebrows.</p>
    <p>She spun onto her stomach, and dropped both arms back down the crack, while trying to spot Acris in the general underground gloom. With Cel’s help, Acris successfully squeezed himself through the hole in the ground.</p>
    <p>“Acris, sir,” Cel said, standing back up. “We were conducting important recon of the local ruins.”</p>
    <p>“Parrain Ehra!” Acris scooted away from the hole sheepishly.  He attempted to hide his hard-won scroll behind his back.</p>
    <p>Ehra looked between the two soggy youths and chuckled to himself.</p>
    <p>“It must have been some mission then, hm?”</p>
    <p>He looked at the precious page clutched in Acris’ hand, “It looks like you even found something important,”</p>
    <p>He turned to Cel, eyeing the item she was desperately trying to hold behind her back, “Is that a sword, Cel?” </p>
    <p>Cel gave up on hiding it, and slid it back into her belt. “Yes, sir,” she said cheerily, underlined by a wavering grin. “Requisitioned it straight from the armory.”</p>
    <p>Ehra glanced towards the gap in the floor, “Ah, yes, the armory in the sub-basement. I hear the approval process is quite challenging. Well, let’s see it.”</p>
    <p>Ehra held out his hand to Cel. </p>
    <p>Cel glanced sideways at Acris, and then slowly pulled the sword out from her belt, placing it in Ehra’s hand hilt-first, with the blade tucked under her arm. “Needs a bit of cleaning,” she said apologetically. </p>
    <p>“I see,” Ehra took the blade and inspected it curiously. He frowned at the handle, then ran his finger along the flat of the blade. He turned it sideways, balancing the spine of the blade on his finger until he found the blade’s balance point, just in front of the hilt.</p>
    <p>“The blade needs work. It is, hm, unreliable as it is now. The hilt is just a mess, and the edge is worn and poorly maintained. The heart of the blade, though, the steel, is good. The balance point is excellent, and the weight is perfect. It could be an excellent sword, but it isn’t at the moment.”</p>
    <p>He turned the sword and offered it to Cel hilt first, “You’re having a hard  time fitting in here, I understand.” </p>
    <p>Cel sighed and took the sword back, her gaze fixed on the blade. "People have opinions. And I don't always match them or agree with them. Or listen to them." She glanced back up at Ehra. "It’s not like I don't want to fit in. I just… I'm not wrong. And pretending I'm wrong is worse."</p>
    <p>Ehra nodded, "But you <i>do</i> feel like you still should be here, that you have something to learn, otherwise you would be long gone." </p>
    <p>Cel nodded. </p>
    <p>"I agree," Ehra gave her a serious look, "But I don't think you are ready yet. Blade elf discipline isn't for everyone. You have a long way to go, and right now we're just butting heads, and you have a very, <i>very</i> thick head." </p>
    <p>Cel took a step back. “So what’s your opinion?” she said, keeping her eyes low.</p>
    <p>"My opinion is that you need to grow on your own a little bit more before you can learn what you need from us. So, here is my offer. I'll let you keep that sword, and I'll get you the paperwork to go where you would like. In return, I want you to return that sword to me in one year. If that sword has reached its potential… then we will talk more. What do you think?” </p>
    <p>Cel visibly relaxed. She met Ehra’s eyes. “All right, sir. I can do that.” </p>
    <p>Ehra’s smile returned, “Good to hear.”</p>
    <p>He turned his head towards Acris slightly, “Perhaps some time with the river elves would do her some good. After all, she needs to learn from someone.” </p>
    <p>Cel glanced at Acris, and then back to Ehra. “...It won’t be a lot of studying, will it? I’m not much of a Rupert.” </p>
    <p>Ehra shrugged in reply, “That’s up to them. I hear river elves prefer to learn by doing, but it’s not up to me. That’s why I’m suggesting it. They might teach things in a way that helps you more than I have.” </p>
    <p>Acris absorbed the conversation like a sponge. </p>
    <p>“Do you,” he paused to consider his words very carefully and not let his accent muddy them, “do you want t’ come upriver with me?”</p>
    <p>Cel paused for a moment, and then nodded. "Sounds like an adventure to me. <i>And</i> there's no Terje."</p>
    <p>Ehra looked at Acris, who was pointedly looking at the sky.</p>
    <p>"Well then," Ehra chuckled, "You had better go get that cut looked after. I'll smooth things out with Smilisca. In the meantime, don't tell Siiri I'm back here, hm?"</p>
    <p>Grinning ear to ear, Acris enthusiastically agreed.</p>
    <p>“Weh, Parrain Ehra!  Weh!”  The river elf turned and hurried across the courtyard.  With a backward glance, he adds, “Common Cel, let’s go!”</p>
    <p>Cel glanced back at Ehra. “I’m getting myself into something, aren’t I?”</p>
    <p>Without waiting for a reply, she turned and followed Acris.</p>
    <p>Ehra watched the pair run off. Once they were gone, he leaned against the wall behind  him.</p>
    <p>“I certainly hope that you are.”</p>
