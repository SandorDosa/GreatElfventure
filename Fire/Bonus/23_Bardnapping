<p>Barrabus Leafstorm, Phoenix Lord, stared out over the Surtian townscape below him.</p>
<p>Surt was in full bloom; its rooftops were covered in a panoply of flowers stretching across the entirety of the rooftops below, split only by the narrow streets criss-crossing the town. In those gaps, life flowed -- street vendors hawking their wares, a woman on horseback racing down the main road, free bards playing music to the crowds, young elves dancing and prattling and generally <em>living</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry, meanwhile, was trapped on a patio well above the crowds. Stuck in yet another meeting with the &ldquo;Chamber of Firebirds&rdquo;. Forced to listen to another series of hours-long arguments, each one likely to resolve in a way that satisfied no one.</p>
<p><em>Still, it's not all bad</em>, he thought to himself. <em>At least I don&rsquo;t have to do the paperwork.</em></p>
<p>He turned back to his councilors, carefully keeping his face and pose as close to that of a &ldquo;noble leader&rdquo; as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secretary Durand, the bookish bureaucrat Barry considered his most reliable councilor, was hard at work scribbling out the arguments as Treasurer Thornpike extolled the virtues of Surt minting its own currency with copper from the south. Grassknell, the Chamber&rsquo;s arcana expert, grumbled in the corner; his idea was instead to take advantage of the Marr&rsquo;s natural reagent access, and instead base their currency off of popular theories on &ldquo;reactive magical value&rdquo; rather than access to metal. The others were watching Durand with keen interest -- some were even taking notes of their own, as if planning out future arguments or plotting out which angle would benefit them the most.</p>
<p>Barry wandered over to the refreshment stand, gave the bottles lined along it a quick glance, and sighed tiredly before pouring himself a glass of pulque. <em>What I wouldn&rsquo;t give for a Lycan wine about now</em>, he thought to himself. <em>Halfcock&rsquo;s. No, Hunterbear&rsquo;s</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the meeting dragged on, Barry&rsquo;s attention was drawn by something. It would have been drawn by anything that&rsquo;s not the meeting, really, but this might have actually been something significant. He heard what sounded like shouting in the hallways outside. Shouting, followed by what sounded like a scuffle. Curious, he took a few steps towards the door.</p>
<p>Before he could reach it, the door slammed inwards so hard it nearly swung off the hinges. A Coyote elf woman covered in road grit stormed into the room. Her eyes searched the room for a moment before settling on Barry.</p>
<p>Captain Vilhook staggered into the room, adjusting his armor, "Sorry sir," he grumbled, "She claims to have secure orders from the Terror. I-"</p>
<p>"You!" The woman pointed at Barry and marched towards him, "You're the cabron who showed up Coyote in his own house, si?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barrabus smiled. "Indeed I am. And I am going to take a wild guess; you must be Breaker." He bowed. "To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?"</p>
<p>Breaker pulled a sealed envelope out from under her poncho and shoved it into Barry's hands, "I got permission from the big bad bitch herself to come nab you. You're coming to Riverhaven."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry passed the envelope over to Durand, without taking his eyes off Breaker. "...Why? Is Terror planning on beating him with a dance-off?"</p>
<p>Durand tore open the envelope and scanned through its contents. He pushed his glasses further up his nose. "Ordered to the front lines to help counter Coyote's nefarious influence. Excellent!"</p>
<p>Barry blinked. "What?"</p>
<p>"You've seen what Coyote does, si?" Breaker asked Barry, "You've seen what his magic is like. How do you think that works when he's at the head of an army? I've seen that stupid fucking guitar turn entire battles around, and he's sure as hell gonna be there. We need someone who can beat him at his own game, and guess who the one fucking guy who showed he can do that is?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry opened his mouth to reply, but Durand beat him to it.</p>
<p>"Only the Phoenix Lord himself," Durand said, scribbling notes onto a new sheet of parchment. "The one man the despot fears."</p>
<p>"Leading the charge at the head of a shining band of knights," Thornpike said. "That way he can make sure they come back with all of their equipment."</p>
<p>"And at the desperate plea of Coldwater's true ruler," said Amberhearst, the Plebiast. She rarely missed a chance to spin a story to its most dramatic. She turned to Durand. "Jot this down. 'The dashing Breaker came to our Phoenix Lord on bended knee, pleading for his assistance against Coyote's foul and terrible magicks&hellip; Oh, the headlines for this one will be amazing!" She turned to Breaker. "Do you have time for some sketch work? I can have my best surface artist and a clear wall ready in twenty minutes!"</p>
<p>"That's a bit much," said Barry, burying a frown. "And beating Coyote in a bard-duel is way different than holding down the power of his music over his soldiers. Look, Breaker--"</p>
<p>"That just means it's more of a challenge," said Durand, still scribbling. "A perfect way to put a bully down, sir. Right where he thinks he's strongest."</p>
<p>"Well yes, but--"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fuck me," Breaker interrupted and gave Barry a concerned look, "Are <em>all</em> of you guys like this?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Durand shook his head. &ldquo;No, lady, I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But sir Leafstorm is good inspiration for all of us.&rdquo; He gave Barry a look that Barry had long ago learned to dread.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Well, no getting out of this one,</em> Barry thought sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need to pack, of course,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;Have to look my best for the troops. Aim for departure early tomorrow morning? I should have time to arrange for a horse then as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"You've got half an hour," Breaker folds her arms, "Every minute I'm gone is a minute Coyote gets closer. We'll get to Gerdr by nightfall. You can powder your cheeks there. Besides, there's not a horse alive that can keep up with Bravia. And you," she points a finger at Amberhearst, "I hear you say I bent a knee to <em>anyone </em>I'm gonna come back up here and break your fucking fingers, comprende?"</p>
<p>Amberhearst waved a hand. &ldquo;Fine, fine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s a critic. Does this mean you won&rsquo;t be staying for sketch work, then? You&rsquo;re missing out on a great opportunity to get your name out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Breaker here to see you, sirrah,&rdquo; Herringbone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Barry said. He shoved another spangled chiton into a travel satchel. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been thirty minutes yet, has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herringbone hrmphed. &ldquo;Thirty-two, sirrah.&rdquo; He turned to Breaker, just behind him, and gestured towards the door. &ldquo;After you, madame,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of voice somewhere between robotic and extreme boredom.</p>
<p>"Well?" Breaker asked in a somewhat calmer voice than she had in the meeting, "You got everything you need? I don't wanna hear moaning in a couple days 'cuz you forgot your favorite fluffy pillow."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, would you turn back?&rdquo; he said mildly. &ldquo;Grab the guitar of the wall for me, if you don&rsquo;t mind. There&rsquo;s a case that&rsquo;ll fit just underneath it. If I&rsquo;m going to face a fellow bard, it's only fitting I do so with his own weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; She snorted, &ldquo;Of course you ain&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaker suddenly fell silent. This unprecedented event caused Barrabus to turn around and look. Breaker had taken the guitar off the wall and was giving it a distant look. She lifted her head and looked at Barry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leafstorm, where the fuck did you get this?&rdquo; she asked in a surprisingly quiet voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Coyote," he said. He paused. "...It's your father's, isn't it."</p>
<p>Breaker gave him a flat look, "Fucking bards&hellip;" she placed her hands on the guitar and gently placed a finger on one of the strings.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it was his. I can't believe Coyote still had it. Guess he wouldn't just throw away a good instrument&hellip; or a trophy."</p>
<p>"He's playing a very particular archetype," Barry said. "Trophy-hunting is part of that. He has to show people his power. Probably because the alternative is to lose it."</p>
<p>Barry tied off his satchel, tossed it over his shoulder, and turned back to Breaker. "He handed it to me as his "spare", and I&hellip; didn't return it on my way out. ...It seemed like a good idea at the time -- taking a trophy on my way out, so his eyes would stay on me. That said&hellip; it's yours. Take it; I'm better with the fiddle anyway. And giving it back to you is better. Rubs it in his face a bit."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breaker looked over the guitar for a moment then placed it in the case. She held the case out to Barrabus.</p>
<p>"You can give it back to me when the hijueputa is dead," she spoke, "I'm no good with the thing and I want that guitar to be the last thing that bastard hears before he dies. You good enough for that?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry nodded. "Just leave him an ear."</p>
<p>He tied the guitar case onto his back. "He's a powerful spell caster, and you'll be his primary target. Fortunately, he'll want to monologue before he kills you, and that means he'll get distracted. Let him talk; trust me, it's hard to fight and monologue at the same time."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breaker laughed, "Yeah, he usually kills first and monologues later. For serious Leafstorm. I heard what you said back there, and you're right. I may be first on his shit list, but you're second. He's gonna be out for blood and you're gonna be in over your head. Pues, you're also the only one that can <em>maybe</em> hold his magic down. So we'll both watch our asses and you'll be able to give me that back, si?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Si," Barrabus said. He attached his machete onto his belt, and then grabbed some goo from a small tub on his wardrobe, and used the goo to slick back his hair. He glanced into a nearby mirror. "Perfect," he said. "Shall we?"</p>
<p>Breaker gave Barrabus a critical look as he slicked back his hair, then shrugged, &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to do then. Let&rsquo;s move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-FIN-</p>
