        A Minor Miscalculation

<p>Consiliumque Civile Titus Sita was rambling about something or other. Despite the hefty civil servant's enthusiasm, the Hunger couldn&rsquo;t quite focus on what the man was saying. Sita was an intelligent man, and had proven himself indispensable in taming the deadly wasteland of the Maar. More importantly he had proven himself a man of discipline and character, more interested in progress than politics. The Hunger valued Sita&rsquo;s input and wished to keep him cultivated and motivated. Right now, though, the Hunger had received so much information about water purity and concrete mixtures that he felt like he was about to pass out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Conciv Sita continued, &ldquo;The ash purification process isn&rsquo;t resource intensive, but it is space and time intensive as well as potentially hazardous. If we intend to upscale the process, we&rsquo;ll need to designate significant space for refinement. I calculate that each filter requires, oh, say, four cubic feet of ash, replaced weekly. To maintain that output, per filter, we&rsquo;ll need&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I am an alchemist,</em> the Hunger wanted to bark at him, <em>Not some civil engineer. I should be rending ancient mysteries asunder with my audacity and wits alone, not calculating how many square feet of processing space we need per water filter.</em></p>
<p>The Hunger's vision wandered around the office, catching sight of motes of dust floating in beams of fading red sunlight streaming through the window. How long had they been rambling about this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; Sita asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Was all Hunger had as a reply. He had no idea what the Conciv had been saying.</p>
<p>"Hunger, are you feeling alright?" Sita's voice was carefully measured.</p>
<p>"Of course," Hunger waved a hand dismissively, "Please continue."</p>
<p>Sita gave him a concerned look, "It's alright, sir, I know I have been carrying on. We've been attacking this problem so long it's getting dark. We're clearly not making any more progress this evening. "</p>
<p>"Well, we can't&hellip;" Hunger tripped over his words for a moment. He found no reason to keep working on the plans. Indeed, he was feeling light headed. When had he last eaten?</p>
<p>"Hunger, Surt is stable for today at least," Sita smiled, "We've accomplished a lot but we're talking long term planning now. We've got time to work on all this, we don't need to work until our minds are mush. I can come back in a day or two and we can get some rest, look at the problem with fresh eyes. Besides, my wife will be happy to have me home in time for dinner for once."</p>
<p>Hunger found himself nodding, "Yes. Perhaps I have pushed myself - pushed us a bit too hard. Exhaustion doesn't help problem solving. You have performed exemplary work, Sita. Take a few days off with your family. You've more than earned it. Come back when you're ready."</p>
<p>"Thank you sir," Sita gathered his papers and quietly started heading for the door. The Hunger's eyes wandered to the window again.</p>
<p>As Sita opened the door, he hesitated and turned back to the Hunger.</p>
<p>"Sir? If I may?"</p>
<p>"Hm?" The Hunger's attention slowly focused back on the Conciv.</p>
<p>"Promise me you'll take care of yourself. Surt needs you." The man spoke quietly.</p>
<p>"I&hellip;" The Hunger hesitated slightly, "I will. I promise. Thank you, Titus. You are dismissed."</p>
<p>Sita bowed politely and left the room, closing the door behind him. The Hunger found himself slumping back in his chair. He felt light-headed, warm, maybe even feverish. He could feel sweat sticking between his face and the mask. He was short of breath, feeling nauseous. When had that happened?</p>
<p>The Hunger stood up from his desk. As he did, his vision blurred. It felt like his brain sloshed in his skull, like wet ash in a cup. He braced himself on his desk, then took a few steps to the door.</p>
<p>He locked his office door, then found himself slumped against it panting for breath. He staggered back to his desk and collapsed into his chair. He couldn't breathe with this damned mask on.</p>
<p>The Hunger unfastened his mask and set it down on the table, noting that the inside was indeed slick with sweat. He must be ill, he reasoned. Maybe a bad piece of meat, or some nasty infection. Those had been going around. He quietly chastised himself for not noticing sooner. It was absolutely shameful for an alchemist of his caliber to be brought low by a little food poisoning. Sita was right, he needed to take care of himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brewing a curative would take only a few minutes and negligible materials. The Hunger noticed his hands were shaking. He would have to calm his nerves a little before he worked.</p>
<p>There weren't many bottles of blood red Lycan wine left, and certainly no more being made. The Hunger took his last bottle from his desk and poured himself a shallow glass. A quick sip would calm his hands enough to work.</p>
<p>The wine was robust, and sweeter than he remembered. He noticed flavors he hadn't considered before, subtle and fortifying. Shame that this was the last bottle. He sipped slowly and felt his nerves calm. His breathing slowed and his hands became still, though his head still pounded. He swished the glass lightly, to let the delicate flavor breathe. He detected some sweet aromas he hadn't noticed before. Perhaps the Lycan wine was best with a little of the bottom sediment mixed in.</p>
<p>The dimming fiery light of the setting sun illuminated his office. It suited his mood. He held up the glass, letting the sunlight filter through the blood red wine. He turned the glass, examining the delicate color gradients. He paused as he noticed something.</p>
<p>There was a small patch of copper red fur growing on the back of his hand.</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>The crystal glass shattered on the floor as a growing pit of horror tore at the Hunger's mind.</p>
<p><em>That's not possible&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Hunger tore his gaze from his hand and looked out the window. The sun was nearly below the horizon. He ripped open another drawer and frantically pulled papers and scrolls from his desk until he found what he was looking for.</p>
<p>An old calendar scroll. From the war, when knowing the phase of the moon was life or death. The calendar had projections for many years. He unrolled the scroll with shaking hands until he reached today's date.</p>
<p>Tonight was this month's first full moon.</p>
<p>The scroll had scarcely clattered to the desk before the Hunger reached the bookcase. His head pounded and his vision was swimming with black and white spots. He forced himself to move slowly and deliberately.</p>
<p><em>It's not possible,</em> he repeated to himself, <em>I tested myself. I was safe. It's been seven months and nearly as many full moons. It's simply not possible.</em></p>
<p>He almost believed it.</p>
<p>There was a heavy clack as he put the last scroll into place. The bookcase swung inwards on six inches of stone door, revealing the Hunger's lab.</p>
<p>The steady glow of the magic torches played over the white marble floors and the mountain of complex glass fixtures scattered across a half dozen workbenches. The thick concrete walls and pillars in his lab were comforting. He tried to think.</p>
<p><em>It has to be some kind of skin infection,</em> he told himself, <em>A growth that resembles fur, perhaps, and the timing is coincidental.</em></p>
<p>He glanced at his hand. The patch of fur was spreading.</p>
<p>The secret door closed with a slam. He turned the brass handle on the back of the door and heard the heavy iron bolts clunk into place.</p>
<p>Pain ripped through the Hunger's body as he heard a popping groaning sound from his pelvis and shoulders. He retched in agony, and a splatter of red fluid hit the ground. He chose to believe it was wine.</p>
<p><em>It's not a skin infection.</em></p>
<p>His vision pulsed at odd angles with throbbing black and red splotches. His legs felt like they were different lengths. He staggered through his lab, haphazardly knocking over a table and sending glass and parchment scatting across the floor.</p>
<p>The only possible salvation available to the Hunger was concealed behind a loose marble tile in the corner of the lab. He pulled up the tile and retrieved a delicate silver lockbox. He clicked the combination to open his secret stash of wolfsbane.</p>
<p><em>Empty!</em></p>
<p>A howl of rage forced its way out of him as he hurled the box into the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces. He fell to his knees and clasped his hands to his face in frustration. His skin begin to crawl as he felt fur growing and bone lengthening under his fingers.</p>
<p><em>It doesn't matter it's too late</em>, rage welled within him, <em>the timeframe is three days but it's been seven months! Where did my wolfsbane go? This isn't possible!</em></p>
<p>Sheer primal rage built in his chest. He felt his mind begin to slip away, felt the claws of a savage animal begin to drag him away.</p>
<p><em>No,</em> he clenched his slowly sharpening teeth, <em>I am an alchemist and this is a disease. I will not be outsmarted by a dog!</em></p>
<p>He lurched to his feet and immediately collapsed. His knees no longer bent the same way. He crawled towards one of his workbenches and pulled himself upright.</p>
<p>No time for careful measures. He had maybe a few seconds. He poured several cotyla of reagents into an amphora, shook it twice, and hastily downed the entire mixture. It would be crude but effective.</p>
<p>Stabbing pain tore through his stomach. He collapsed into a fetal position clutching his guts. He clamped his hands over his mouth.</p>
<p><em>Do not vomit,</em> he commanded himself, <em>whatever happens do not vomit.</em></p>
<p>A prickling, tingling sensation washed over his skin. The nausea subsided to a dull roar. He struggled to his feet. His mangled body was stable, but the dog still snapped at the back of his mind.</p>
<p><em>It worked, </em>he grimaced, <em>but I've bought a few minutes at best. Nothing can stop this now, but it can be contained.</em></p>
<p>The Hunger grabbed a handful of vials from the table, teetering on his warped legs.</p>
<p><em>A sealant,</em> he spoke to himself, <em>The door opens inwards.</em></p>
<p>The sealant was a type of glue he had been experimenting with, meant for quickly sealing broken concrete. With an accelerant, it would set nearly as strong as stone within a few seconds. He hastily filled the narrow gaps between the secret door and the wall with the sealant, combining it with the accelerant carefully. He tried not to look at his hands.</p>
<p>While the glue set, the Hunger pulled the pins out of the brass handle of the door and yanked it free. He hurled the handle across the room. It hit the wall hard enough to crack the concrete. He didn't think about that. He poured the last of the sealant in the hole for the handle, fusing the mechanism shut.</p>
<p><em>Let's see you pull that open, dog!</em></p>
<p>The dog fought back. The Hunger doubled over as his limbs twisted in pain. He felt the bones of his face groan against each other as they warped. The rage dug its claws deeper.</p>
<p><em>Not yet</em> the Hunger looked up at his wall.</p>
<p>Muspelham. The conflagration. Screaming and burning. Trapped in the ruins of his lab, pinned under concrete. Couldn't breathe. He wouldn't make that mistake again, but in preventing that he had made another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fading light greeted him from the lone window near the ceiling, just enough to illuminate the ladder next to it. His emergency exit. Just wide enough for him to escape through.</p>
<p>He was out of sealant. He had no nails, no wood or hammers, nothing to plug the gap with. Even if he broke the ladder the dog&hellip;</p>
<p><em>The concrete! </em>His rational mind screamed at him.</p>
<p>The experimental concrete mixes lay in a haphazard pile in a supply closet. He didn't care which one he grabbed. His mind was unraveling as was his body. At least now the bag felt so much lighter. He grabbed an amphora of water, his emergency extinguishing supply.</p>
<p>He climbed the ladder and haphazardly dumped water and concrete mix into the gap. He had mere moments. He had to only hope he got it right. He saw the first sliver of the moon through the last gap as he plugged it with a handful of wet cement.</p>
<p>The dog howled in his head and his skin began to burn with agonizing pain. He felt his skeleton rearrange itself violently. He toppled from the ladder and hit the marble floor. Oddly, it didn't hurt at all. He grabbed the ladder with one paw and slammed it into the wall. It shattered like twigs.</p>
<p>The Hunger collapsed into a heap as his body became no longer his own. The dog overwhelmed him, drowning his mind in savage instinct. One last rational thought blinked through his mind.</p>
<p><em>What did I miss?</em></p>
