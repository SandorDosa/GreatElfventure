    <p><b>Tsun:</b> Arrest the Hunger!</p>
    <p>With evidence (hopefully) securely in her grasp, and all of the intel taken from the Wolf Elves in hand, the time has come to arrest the Hunger just as he returns from the Potluck and re-enters Surt. In a public place (i.e. the gatehouse), surrounded by people, and with the hopefully still loyal other members of the Triumvirate right there, there should be no way for the Hunger to escape (or transform and assault them) without it being noticed -- and without therefore ruining any further chance for him to influence Surt. With luck, the Terror will even be willing to execute him right then and there. And once that’s done, the Terror and Fury should be willing to remove the Blade Elves that have been allowing the afflicted Hunger’s behavior (if not willingly, then by the pressure Tsun knows this sort of information can bring down on them).</p>
    <p>There are many, many things about this plan that could go wrong. </p>
    <p>However, there are a lot of things about this plan that could go absolutely right.</p>
    <p>To maximize the chances for the latter, this needs to be as formal, public, and above-board as possible. And this means that Tsun needs to be there, and needs to present the evidence to the Terror or the Fury first, so that they themselves can read it, agree, and assist in the Hunger’s removal. </p>
    <p>Worst case scenario, Tsun knows she and her Praesidium escort can fall back and inform the Charred Eagles’ leadership of the Hunger’s traitorous behavior, and then he and the Blade Elves can be driven from Surt by force.</p>
    <p>Whatever happens, this will be finished early in the season, leaving Tsun plenty of time to push for a new appointment to the Triumvirate (herself obviously).</p>
    <p><b>Hunger:</b> Landmine</p>
    <p>Well, this is just hilarious. Not two minutes back home, and Tsun is trying to arrest you for being a werewolf.</p>
    <p>The irony is actually pretty unpleasant; its like licking an electric wire. And that makes the shocking evidence she’s presenting all the more interesting. </p>
    <p>You’re standing there, reading over some of Tsun’s evidence papers, while the Ashwalker herself gets into a loud and increasingly vitriolic argument with Katya (best to keep to that name for now) over your arrest warrant (again, painful irony). All of the papers report to be from “the palace”, though they’re bound together in a folder marked “Evidence recovered from suspected wolf elf spy, KDE”. </p>
    <p>Despite her brash tendencies, Tsun is thorough, and tends to make her moves at least partially above board -- she’s interested in legitimately, not illegitimately, seizing control, or “fighting outside influence”, or whatever she’s calling it this week. So the outside folder is likely accurate, and “KDE”, or killed during encounter, suggests that the spy in question could easily have been a dupe sent to get killed while carrying a batch of dummy intel. And given that according to this intel you consumed at least three babies and tore apart several “lab assistants” you’re pretty sure you’ve never heard of (not to mention<i> you don’t have lab assistants</i>), this is clearly dummy intel.</p>
    <p>Tsun must be aware of this. Either she’s already turned -- but then why the arrest? Either you would already be on their side, or they’d be better served smuggling you out or killing you silently -- or she’s aware the intel is questionable, but is too tempting not to try. Or this is a pretext to killing you, but then Tsun’s insistence on a public arrest, and shouting match with Katya, would make your death very public and extremely embarrassing for her. Unlikely.</p>
    <p>This also means the Wolf Elves wanted to catch you coming and going. Why? ...To cause internal strife if you died at the potluck, and were declared afflicted. The evidence is flimsy, but that hardly matters if the accusation was already proven true. Clever move on their part, but then why offer the cure? Sentiment wasn’t exactly Cantia’s thing. And if they assumed you would be killed anyway -- the Tourist was pretty clear on that mark -- then why not just let it happen? To force you to hurry up? </p>
    <p>Or because they assumed the Tourist would not kill you if you were cured.</p>
    <p>And then, with you arrested, they could easily smuggle you out of Surt -- or offer you the chance to turn in exchange for restoration of your power.</p>
    <p>You smile to yourself. Such arrogance. You can use that. </p>
    <p>Better hope you’re right.</p>
    <p>Traditional jail is too insecure, and leaves the question of your guilt a little too open. House arrest, on the other hand, allows you to set the stage, and is easily justified by the idea that you are being monitored to make sure you aren’t alchemically hiding the transformation. </p>
    <p>You chafe at the thought of being cooped up in the villa. Plus, you were planning on lending it to ‘Katya’ for her vacation. Well… it can still mostly be hers. You’ll just be occupying one of the rooms for a while. Maybe have some of your work brought over to you; this is a good time to consider anti-affliction filter options and technical research concepts anyway, and no part of ‘house arrest’ says you can’t invite a few friends (or the whole CPC) over.</p>
    <p>And certainly, Katya would probably enjoy an ambush-revenge plan. As would Tsun, once she’s aware of how much this relied on her being duped; you suppose it might be time to ‘clue her in’ on a few important Wolf Elf details (maybe even your battle with affliction -- it’ll keep her interested, and probably hopeful that she can remove you later). Allophryne would probably be interested, though it's hard to tell. Terror as well, and Fury, though you suppose that means you might have some apologizing to do during this.</p>
    <p>A simple plan -- Praesidium guards inside and outside the villa, with Terror and Katya on rotating shifts, and regular “file pulls” from the Palace to cover their entrances and exits. Tsun, Fury, and Allophryne on site when available, with similar entrance and exit plans. And you, of course, working in an enclosed office, ready and waiting to be “rescued.”</p>
    <p>And publicly? You’re ‘suspected’ of being afflicted, but have passed all of the normal tests (which you will, because you’re not. Isn’t that a nice feeling?). Tsun, however, has demanded that you remain under house arrest at least through the next few full moons, to prove that you’re not hiding it with alchemy.</p>
    <p>You suddenly notice that the loud argument has ceased, and Tsun and Katya have been staring at you with awkward concern for several seconds. Umm. Shoot. How to recover from this. Ah, of course.</p>
    <p>“Woof.”</p>
    <p>Yes, offend both parties. Classy. </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The Hunger sat in the far corner of his bedroom-turned-office, hunched over a pile of scrolls covered in twisting arcanic ratios. The Fury sat a bit across from him, tracing complicated figures onto parchment, with sparks regularly burning black spots into her couch. To her left sat a goblet, holding around half a cup of dark wine.</p>
    <p>The goblet also held several ounces of ash, mixed carefully into the wine.</p>
    <p>The first time the Fury brought her work in with her, she absent-mindedly drank from it, promptly resulting in her spewing smoking ash all over the table, the Hunger, and his scrolls. She’d also called him “an onager-headed jerkface”, which the Hunger considered a weak and hackneyed insult. He had informed her that she could do better, at which point she’d thrown the wine in his face.</p>
    <p>This sequence of events had repeated four times since then. Hunger was starting to think that the Fury has a drinking problem.</p>
    <p>Fury reached for the goblet, her eyes focused on a complicated transmutational algorithm. </p>
    <p>"You're reaching for it again," Hunger said, without looking up.</p>
    <p>"Thanks," Fury muttered. She drew her arm back to the parchment in front of her. "I wish you would toss that out."</p>
    <p>"It'll serve its purpose," the Hunger said.</p>
    <p>"Which is?" The Fury said.</p>
    <p>"It has… metaphorical significance."</p>
    <p>"More secrets. Wonderful." She pushed the parchment away from her, and looked up at Hunger. "I'm still angry at you, you know."</p>
    <p>"You should be," the Hunger said, still not looking up. "I endangered this entire city."</p>
    <p>"Then how could-- why didn't you tell us?" Fury fumed, arms crossed. </p>
    <p>"You would have had me executed," Hunger said. "And it would have been your duty to do so."</p>
    <p>Fury shook her head. “We could have kept it secret, and looked for a cure together -- maybe even have asked the others for ideas, and found out from the-- the Tourist earlier. Much earlier. You almost died, Hunger, and… and that’s not even the worst that could have happened. That almost happened. And would have happened if that--”</p>
    <p>“I <i>know</i>,” the Hunger said. He paused. “And if I had been found out, and you or Terror had been hiding my affliction from anyone, the Triumvirate would have collapsed. ‘No exceptions,’ Fury. That was the rule, and we all agreed to it. And I was not about to set myself above it.”</p>
    <p>“You did, though,” Fury said quietly. “...And I’m not saying I’m not glad you’re alive. Or that we don’t need you.”</p>
    <p>The Hunger nodded. “...You’re correct, I did, at that.” He sighed. “The dog reminded me of that, as well. Some of my hubris reflected back from it. From myself, I should say. And I can’t really say that hiding my affliction was a selfless act. But I had to try, Fury.”</p>
    <p>Fury cocked her head sideways. “To stay alive?”</p>
    <p>“To save this city. I owe you -- all of you -- that much. We were barely a village back then -- imagine what could have happened with one of the leadership suddenly dead from affliction. Imagine how much worse Tsun’s wolfhunts would have been. Imagine how the populace would view outsiders. I have to see this done, Fury. ...And honestly, I thought I’d seen you through enough. I meant what I said; I went to the Potluck to die. And… I suppose I know now that I’m not… required. You and Terror and… Tsun and even Barry; you have this. I’m not--”</p>
    <p>“Going to keep ruling over us with an iron fist?" Fury smiled. “Stop crushing the peasantry? Make dancing legal again?”</p>
    <p>Hunger blinked. “You’re making fun of me.”</p>
    <p>“You’re the one beating yourself up,” Fury said. “And overhyping yourself, at the same time. It’s very impressive, dear Hunger.”</p>
    <p>“I think I liked you better when you were angry with me.”</p>
    <p>“Who says I’m not?” The Fury flashed at grin at Hunger. </p>
    <p>Hunger rolled his eyes.</p>
    <p>“I’m glad you’re alive,” the Fury said, standing back up. “And don’t start acting like we don’t need you. You’re vital to this city. The Aqua Via, the water filters, the gardens… the tax laws; Cal’s grace, I have no idea what those should look like. I don’t even know what ours look like right now! We have some, right?”</p>
    <p>Hunger nodded.</p>
    <p>“You’re the… the tinder that keeps this city burning,” Fury said. She paused, as if her thoughts were catching on something. “You’re making a big difference. And we’re all counting on you for it. And that means you need to stay alive. And sane. And to tell us if you’re going to turn into a fur-covered psychopath. We’re a team. And we’re way better at solving things together, and we owe it to this city to try.”</p>
    <p>Hunger blinked, and wondered -- not for the first time -- what debt it was that Fury felt she owed.</p>
    <p>“Its late,” the Fury continued. She grabbed her scrap of parchment, and then stepped over and tapped lightly on the bedroom closet door. “And I’m going to go home, and drink something actually drinkable, and stare at something that’s not overwhelmingly complicated.”</p>
    <p>Hunger nodded. “Thank you for the company.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t mention it,” Fury said, popping the door open. “And stay safe.”</p>
    <p>Hunger waved her off, and watched as the door slid shut behind her. Almost as soon as the Fury is gone, the Hunger's new bodyguards return.</p>
    <p>Allophryne takes his post beside the door while "Katya" does a quick pass of the room. She then gives Hunger a salute that is something sloppier than most blade elves tend to give.</p>
    <p>"Nothing to report, boss," Katya states in the more relaxed voice of her cover identity. </p>
    <p>“I assume the Praesidium guards are still stationed outside?” The Hunger asks, rolling one of the larger scrolls shut.</p>
    <p>"Sure, such as it is," she shrugs and takes her post standing next to him, "Still not sure what kinda good a bunch of bakers and blacksmiths with clubs will do, but they're posted." </p>
    <p>“It would be hard to get rid of all of them quietly,” the Hunger says. “And it makes them feel like they have more of a presence in their government; a share in the safety of the city. Plus, all they need to do is keep me inside, or see me if I leave, and neither of those tasks take significant effort.” </p>
    <p>"Guess that's why you pay us for the hard stuff then, boss," she smirks a bit. </p>
    <p>“Ah yes. Guarding a stationary building. Making sure no one kicks open my door. Truly, the hardest of tasks. I think I have a cork stuck in an amphora somewhere; I’m certain that will be up to your skills.” </p>
    <p>"Your gold, boss. Fifty a pop, specifically." </p>
    <p>The Hunger laughed. "How is the city, Katya?" he said, making a point to use the right name. "I assume you went out when your shift was up. No obvious unrest? Tavern still in one piece?"</p>
    <p>"Well a lot of people don't like blade elves, that's for sure," she gives a toothy grin, "That just makes it more fun, though. Yeah, though, lots of grumbling but it's holding up. Nice place. Good food." </p>
    <p>“And the Constabulary Guard haven’t arrested you yet, either,” Hunger notes. “So you can’t have gotten into too much trouble. Good, good. Make yourselves comfortable; I will be studying these scrolls for some time.” </p>
    <p>"Sure, boss." Katya folds her arms and stands at her post beside Hunger. Neither she nor Allophryne move from their posts. It isn't even readily apparent that they are all tense.</p>
    <p>A couple hours pass before the wolf elves make their move.</p>
    <p>“Boss.” Katya alerts Hunger in a grim voice. She puts a hand on her longsword, or at least the disguise covering her actual slightly more distinctive weapon.</p>
    <p>It takes Hunger and Allophryne a couple seconds to notice the thin layer of mist on the floor. Hunger scoots back in his chair as the mist rises up to the surface of his desk. It condenses into a vaguely humanoid form before the wolf elf returns to a solid shape.</p>
    <p>One, singular wolf elf. A middle aged woman, with eternally disorganized lab gear covered in a red cloak. Even with the extra grey fur and longer hair, Hunger recognizes the manic smile and green eyes.</p>
    <p>Cantia, now very distinctly a wolf elf, sits on the edge of Hunger’s desk with her legs swinging playfully under it. Katya steps back with a hiss. She does a very convincing job of looking surprised.</p>
    <p>“What did you <i>do</i> to yourself…” Katya mutters.</p>
    <p>Cantia ignores her completely, giving Hunger an even broader grin.</p>
    <p>“Hey there, apprentice!” her voice is cheerful and bubbly, “It’s been a while! You look good!” </p>
    <p>“Cantia!” the Hunger says, a little bit of affection slipping briefly into his voice. “Get off my desk.” </p>
    <p>Cantia laughs jovially, "Oh, fine, you old stick in the mud!"</p>
    <p>She hops off the desk and turns to face him.</p>
    <p>"Well! Have to say, I'm proud of you! I was half worried you'd gone off on one of those tragically moralistic moods of yours, but it looks like you came to your senses in time. I'm just glad I figured out it was you! Oh!"</p>
    <p>She claps her hands in excitement, "I simply must see it! That is, of course, if you can trust the help." She gives Katya a sideways look. Katya returns it motionlessly. </p>
    <p>The Hunger laughs. “All these years, and you haven’t changed a bit!” He waves to his two bodyguards. “And yes, yes, I trust them explicitly. But I’m not changing anything until I get an answer from you; this was your technique, yes? Your infection?</p>
    <p>“I was extremely careful after being bitten -- and careful with my clothing afterwards. You taught me that. So how did I get infected? And so late after the bite, too. So it sounds like you had targeted someone, and didn’t know it would be me. I’m not too surprised; I just want to know how it happened.” </p>
    <p>"Well, a girl can't be <i>too</i> forward. You'll have to sweet talk me a little before <i>that</i>, but between you and me…" she taps her nose conspiratorially, "That little trinket of yours is <i>quite</i> fascinating. I targeted the Hunger, of course! I didn't realize that was <i>you</i> until I saw your work! Quite clever, that mask. I still can't remember your name or face, but it can't make me forget <i>you</i>! I'm just glad it wasn't too late!" </p>
    <p>"You did cut it rather close," the Hunger says. "<i>Again</i>. I'm somewhat surprised I lasted as long as I did. The second personality was a particularly nice touch. ...I'm also surprised you didn't target the Terror. She would have made for a very… impressive field test, I assume." </p>
    <p>Cantia taps her chin, "Yes, I imagine she would be <i>glorious</i>. Sadly, or maybe better for us, you were the one with a convenient scapewolf. The Heir never bit her. Fate is odd like that, no?" </p>
    <p>She blinks, "Wait, it manifested as a second personality? <i>Fascinating!</i> That's quite unexpected! Did it continue after your conversion?" </p>
    <p>Hunger shook his head. "Fortunately no; it was a detestable coward. So, our <i>Tourist…</i> one of yours? I assume she was what you meant by 'heir'." </p>
    <p>Cantia’s face twists up, “Yes, <i>that</i> individual. Not ours, no, but here you are again trying to kiss on a first date. I’d love to discuss that individual with you, but I feel like you’re stalling me Apprentice.”</p>
    <p>She tilts her head a bit, “Maybe I need to show you mine first.”</p>
    <p>Cantia takes a deep breath. Silver grey fur rolls over her skin. She gains nearly a foot in height. The somewhat frail middle aged elf is replaced with a much stronger looking werewolf. Unlike an afflicted, her change seems much more smooth and even. Katya sucks in a breath of shock at the change. Cantia’s green eyes still twinkle as she looks at the Hunger.</p>
    <p>“Come on, Apprentice,” she smiles, “I just <i>have</i> to know what you look like!” </p>
    <p>“<i>Step off!</i>” Katya strides forward and puts a hand on Cantia’s shoulder, “Keep them chompers back from the boss!”</p>
    <p>“Get your <i>hand</i> off me, pitdog,” Cantia growls at Katya.</p>
    <p>“No way, no how. Step <i>back</i>, boss’s orders.”</p>
    <p>The two women lock eyes for a moment. Hunger realizes what Katya is doing. She’s distracting Cantia, even for a brief moment. He has a chance to act without Cantia looking at him. </p>
    <p>And, opportunist that he is, Hunger thinks hard on what the Hungerdog looked like, and quickly tosses an <i>alter self</i> effect together and splashes it over himself. In an instant, his elf form is replaced; he remains seated, and steeples his claws beneath his snout. </p>
    <p>"And you were accusing me of being forward," he says carefully, trying to seem comfortable with talking while snouted. "Yet you want so badly to see me change." He shrugs. "No matter. See what you were looking for?" </p>
    <p>“Holy <i>shit</i>,” Katya does a good job of pretending to be surprised as she backs off.</p>
    <p>Cantia, for her part, seems to immediately forget Katya exists.</p>
    <p>“Oooh!” Cantia claps her hands, “Absolutely perfect! Oh, and I love the touch with the mask! You look absolutely natural! I’m so proud of you!” </p>
    <p>"Still think I would have preferred 'dragon'," Hunger grumbles. </p>
    <p>Cantia chuckles, "Ah, but we work with the tools we have, Apprentice, and how kind were our former masters to leave us such a useful one!"</p>
    <p>Hunger catches a glimpse of Katya's hand as she grips her sword's hilt tight enough for her knuckles to go white, but she still doesn't move. </p>
    <p>"Yes, a thick fur coat," Hunger said. "Exactly what a Fire Elf needs. So… I have to assume you had a reason to stop by, other than just to catch up. And don't misunderstand, I <i>am</i> thrilled to see you. Six months ago I thought you were dead." </p>
    <p>“Well same to you!” she puts her hands on her hips in a fairly disconcerting gesture for a werewolf, “But, ah, I guess the time for catching up has passed. Back to <i>politics,</i> such as it is. Well, now that we’ve passed that little hurdle and I can show off your real potential? We have options. I guess it’s pretty obvious that our original intent was to kill the Hunger, no? Thankfully, our little experiment proved that you’re potentially far more valuable alive than dead, or in prison. Prove you can work with us, and we can make sure this little wolf hunt goes away and you can stay right where you are.” </p>
    <p>"What makes you think I won't?" he replies. "Or that I need outside help?"</p>
    <p>Cantia folds her arms, “Oh, is that why you’re locked in your house and relying on… ugh, <i>adventurers?</i>”</p>
    <p>Katya scoffs with mild insult. </p>
    <p>"No, that's because someone tossed a dissident some fake documents," Hunger replies. "Someone that conveniently managed to catch fire soon afterwards. Funny how flammable some of your spies are. If that's an example of your help these days… well, it's no wonder you came looking for me." </p>
    <p>Cantia’s voice takes that cool edge he remembers often preceding one of her more painful lessons, “No credit for partial answers, Apprentice. This is a chance for <i>you</i>, not for <i>me</i>. You are not as in control as you think you are, wolf or no.” </p>
    <p>Hunger recognizes he might be pressing too far, but presses on anyway. "Indeed? You've given me both the cure and the cause. I'm under house arrest, certainly… by Tsun. If I couldn't handle Tsun, why would I keep her here?"</p>
    <p>Cantia's smile takes a decidedly non-cheerful bent, "Oh? So confident! Hm, well, I suppose all that wolf blood <i>does</i> go to the head a bit. I should have expected some push back, all things considered. Let me be clear… I am not giving you the opportunity to join me again because I <i>need</i> you. I am giving you the opportunity because I <i>like</i> you. Do you really think our plan would require you to off yourself in some melodramatic display? No, Apprentice. You are right where we wanted you to be," she shrugs, "maybe a little more sane, but it doesn't matter. Think very, very carefully about what you do next, and what happens to help that falls out of my favor." </p>
    <p>Hunger sighs. "Can you blame me for trying to follow your example? What would you ask of me? Recruit the Terror?"</p>
    <p>He gestures to the goblet. "Try the wine; it's some of our finest." </p>
    <p>Carefully and without taking her eyes off Hunger, Cantia takes the cup and swirls it gently. She takes a sniff of it. She flicks an ear, then shrugs and takes a sip.</p>
    <p>“Ah!” she comments, “Maybe you have a point. I haven’t had wine like this since-”</p>
    <p>As she takes a slightly deeper sip, she suddenly spits.</p>
    <p>“- what the- is this <i>ash?</i> What is this, some kind of bizarre fire elf flavoring?” </p>
    <p>"I'm afraid it's all Surt has to give," Hunger says sardonically. He stands up. "It’s been wonderful to see you, Cantia, and you can tell whoever's paying for your lab space now that I am healthy, strong, and in no need of assistance. You've given me more than enough. And rest assured, I plan to spread your gifts -- with my own touches of course -- quite far indeed. To the Terror, for example; she's already received some, in fact." </p>
    <p>Cantia’s expression is unamused as she tosses the goblet aside, “<i>Always</i> with the melodrama, Apprentice. What’d you do, bite her in her sleep? She’d kill you before you got two syllables of ‘I have a cure’ out. Cute. I suppose you’ve made your decision final, then?” </p>
    <p>“Yes,” the Hunger says. “And don’t pretend it isn’t the same as yours would be in that position; we both know better. If your people have something to discuss, we’re always open for diplomats and envoys. Until then, please remind your government that Surt and all of its colonies are mine, and its people have spent far too long as slaves to have any interest in returning. Any further acts of affliction-based terrorism will be stymied by the very gifts you gave me. And maybe when next we meet, it’ll be on better terms, <i>mistress</i>, but at least for tonight, Hunger rules.”</p>
    <p>Cantia sighs, “Oh well.”</p>
    <p>The Terror has heard enough.</p>
    <p>She erupts through the door she has been hiding behind. She knows what those words mean, and she knows that there is no turning back now. She hurls the splintered piece of wood out of the way and stalks across the room, leveling her hammer across her chest and preparing to cave the insane alchemist’s head in.</p>
    <p>Cantia smiles.</p>
    <p>“Oh, fabulous!” She turns towards Terror, “I was hoping you might be here! Now I can kill both of you!”</p>
    <p>Terror makes a rumbling noise like steel being torn in half.</p>
    <p>Katya beats her to it. As soon as Cantia turns her back, she draws her “longsword” and slashes it across the werewolf’s back. Cantia grunts in pain and rolls with the blow. She snarls and twists backwards, only to catch a giggin’ stick to her abdomen. Her blood hisses and pops as it touches the tines of Allophryne’s silver spear. The Lycan runes glow on the weapon. His sight has revealed the twisted writing mass of wolf and elf that is Cantia. He needs no instruction.</p>
    <p>Cantia rips away from the spear, spilling blood from the barbed spines. Her smile doesn’t falter.</p>
    <p>“Now, now, not yet! I’m not presentable like <i>this!</i>”</p>
    <p>She snaps something on a locket near her neck. There’s a puff of smoke. Her form blurs and darts away from the group of elven warriors. She skids to a halt near the far wall and takes a steel flash out of her coat. In a swift pull she downs it, then tosses it to the floor.</p>
    <p>The werewolf’s skin shudders and ripples. Her joints pop as her frame grows, her arms and legs lengthen. There is a noise like ripping paper as plates of hard bone tear through her skin. With a sickening pop, a pair of batlike wings rip through her back. She shakes like a wet dog, splattering blood on the floor.</p>
    <p>“<i>Much</i> better,” Cantia’s voice is like grinding stone as she looks up at her enemies, “Well?”</p>
    <p>Hunger quietly strides around the desk and splatters a paste on Katya’s back. She glances at him.</p>
    <p>“Well?” he asks her as the substance glows with magic, “What am I paying you for again?”</p>
    <p>Terror roars like a blast furnace. Black smoke erupts from her skin, blurring her shape as she rushes at Cantia like an angry pyroclastic surge. She hurls the mass of her hammer at the wretched wolflike monster. Katya and Allophryne glance at eachother, then join the charge with battle cries.</p>
    <p>Cantia casually holds up a mutated paw. Terror’s silversheen hammer hits it with a dull thud. She casually tosses it aside, causing Terror to reel sideways to keep hold of it. Cantia casually bats aside Katya’s blade with a bone armored forearm, then Allophryne’s spear literally bounces off her chest sparking with magic.</p>
    <p>“My turn!” Cantia giggles. It is not a reassuring sound in her current form. </p>
    <p>The alchemist pulls something from her belt and lunges for Terror, apparently unfazed by the confusing smoke. Terror barely has time to register a small black shape less than an inch from her face before she recognizes it as a bomb. On reflex, she turns her body to smoke. The bomb explodes with a crack, sending shards of blackened metal through her hazy form. If she hadn’t reacted, it would have taken her face off. She feels a shudder and arcs of black energy spark through her. She forces herself to stay together as some kind of foul magic hits her. Some kind of curse.</p>
    <p>“Terror! Are you-” Katya starts to call out.</p>
    <p>“Oh, shut up, no one cares about you pit dog,” Cantia snarls as she casually tosses another bomb at the merc. Katya lifts her sword to protect her face, but the bomb sends dozens of nail-like pieces of metal stabbing into her chest and arms. She gasps and staggers back as  black energy pulses over her body. The energy arcs over her arms and legs.</p>
    <p>Terror lets out a howl and snaps back to solid form. Furious speed fills her as she swings her hammer in a wide arc. Cantia throws out an arm, blocking the blow. Terror hauls back and swings again like she’s driving a post into the ground. Cantia grunts with the second hit, and the third hit ends with a sick crunch that pushes the monster back with a yelp.</p>
    <p>Katya screams with rage. As the black energy of the curse sparks over her body trying to force her limbs to work against her, she fights through it with sheer hate and raises her sword above her head. In her wrath and pain, she forgets how low the ceiling is. The blade carves a gouge in the ceiling and goes wide. She snarls and swings wide, catching only another chunk of bone. Her eyes are wide with rage.</p>
    <p>“<i>We talked about this, weh!</i>” Allophryne yells. He steps back behind his berserk master. He touches the golden bracelet that Fury gave him, matching Katya’s. He traces the rune and pushes healing energy into it, watching Katya’s wounds heal slightly. If she isn’t going to take care of herself, well, someone has to.</p>
    <p>“Bothersome,” Cantia glares at Katya. She smashes another bomb into Katya’s chest, driving her back further.</p>
    <p>Katya screams in anger again, earning a scowl from Cantia, “You should just die and get it over with. The adults are fighting.”</p>
    <p>With that, Cantia lunges for Terror with a bomb held in her fist. Terror  staggers back as Cantia literally tucks the explosive in her armpit. Terror briefly has time to register that the bomb is exploding inches from her heart before the nails tear through her flesh - her smoky, insubstantial flesh. She hadn’t even activated the spell on purpose. Reflex alone had saved her. The black energy of the curse surges through Terror’s body. She resists, but barely. She sees black energy curling around her vision. Cantia was winning. There had to be a way to change the momentum.</p>
    <p>Suddenly Terror feels her pain lessen. Her wounds are closing and there is a cooling sensation on her back. She glances to see Hunger standing behind her with a jar in his hands, having just applied a healing formula. Allophryne steps back from the barrage of nails, touching his bracelet to heal Katya. At least they had help. Hunger makes a vague gesture towards Cantia, as if politely suggesting she strike. Well, some kind of help anyway.</p>
    <p>Katya screams with rage, but the curse arcs over her body as she attacks. She fights through it to strike, but the sheer force of will it takes her to move distracts her. Cantia holds up her arms, deflecting the blows.</p>
    <p>“Would you <i>stop that?</i>” Cantia hisses.</p>
    <p>She’s distracted. Terror wastes no time in pretense. She sweeps her hammer low and fast, just under Cantia’s peripheral vision. It hits her digitigrade knee from the back, popping it out of socket and forwards with a crunch. Cantia howls and staggers to kneeling, giving Terror just enough room. She swings her hammer diagonally over her shoulder, slamming its full weight directly into Cantia’s face.</p>
    <p>There is a sickening sound like a popping melon and a spray of red and black from Cantia’s head. Terror feels a jerk on her hammer. Cantia has grabbed it. With a gurgling sound that might be intended as a growl, she throws Terror’s hammer back causing the warrior to step back to maintain balance. Another nail bomb drives her back further, splattering the ground with her blood. Katya barks in pain as another bomb catches her in the shoulder and sprays nails across half her face.</p>
    <p>There is a popping, bubbling noise that sounds like it might be laughter. Cantia stands up again. Half her face is missing, her right eye dangling out of its socket. Her lower jaw is simply missing. She’s reaching for more bombs.</p>
    <p>“Bad dog.”</p>
    <p>Hunger bolts around Terror’s back, still disguised as werewolf. He carefully takes aim and tosses one of his own bombs at his former master. It shatters on her face and coats her upper body in burning tar. The smell of melting flesh and hair fills the room. The fire spreads over her whole body. The laughing sound continues. Katya gags. Cantia stands to her full height, then collapses slowly. The extra mass of her wolf form burns away, leaving only a pile of slowly cremating elf.</p>
    <p>The group stares at the burning corpse for a few moments.</p>
    <p>Bryti snarls, no longer maintaining her cover as Katya. She traces a rune on her chest, then draws a hunk of black matter through the center of the glowing inscription. She casually tosses the curse aside like a wet towel, causing it to splatter and hiss as it evaporates on the floor.</p>
    <p>“What… in <i>Hel?</i>” She pants as her rage subsides, “She didn’t even try to escape…” </p>
    <p>“...Huh,” the Hunger says. “That feels almost... anticlimactic, really. Cantia actually died from something.” He takes a step closer, eyes wide, the dog-mask somehow showing a puzzled expression despite its rigid bronze. “She always did juke to the left.”</p>
    <p>He bends over, and gently takes the corpse’s rapidly charring hand. “I… I may need a moment,” he says.</p>
    <p>He glances towards her face, at her lost jaw and dangling eyeball. His eyes narrow.</p>
    <p>“Wait. Of course,” he says sourly. “Cantia would have had a contingency cloning effect on standby. Why else come here herself, with no escape route, and hope to actually encounter Terror here?” He groans. “And to think I felt bad for you again, you silly bitch. That would require you to try and be responsible for something -- you can’t even die without abandoning something important.”</p>
    <p>He squeezes the burning hand, and rips a ring from one of its fingers. </p>
    <p>"Of course," Bryti grumbles, "Just once, I wish the bad ones would die as easy as the good." </p>
    <p>“Not as complicated a trick as you might think,” the Hunger says. He holds the ring up, and tries to wipe some of the dust off of it with soot-covered fingers. “Given enough time, I’m certain I could match it.” He runs a finger along the seal at the top of the ring, and then tosses it neatly into a pocket.</p>
    <p>“Ah yes, I see much to emulate here,” Bryti comments as she eyes the still sizzling mutilated corpse.</p>
    <p>She eyes Hunger’s still altered werewolf form, then sits down cross-legged. She places her sword on her lap and begins to ritualistically clean the blood from the blade. She nods to Allophryne, indicating him to do the same. The river elf sits next to her and imitates, cleaning the tines of his giggin’ stick.</p>
    <p>“Did you See her?” Bryti asks her apprentice quietly.</p>
    <p>“Weh,” Allophryne answers with a shiver.</p>
    <p>“I have never seen anything remotely like it.”</p>
    <p>Bryti looks over at the Hunger again, “Innkeeper… if you had taken her abomination of a false cure, I would have killed you without a second thought.” </p>
    <p>Hunger stands up, and quaffs a tincture from his belt. Almost instantly, the wolf-fur begins to melt, and his bones and flesh knit back into elf format. </p>
    <p>"Was the difference that noticeable?" he slurs. "I'll admit, in my own attempts to study the curse, I found only a few noticeable magical differences between myself and the dog. </p>
    <p>"For that matter, I wonder if they are even aware there is a difference. Cantia… likely would not care, but whoever or whatever is backing her might." </p>
    <p>Bryti’s eyebrows furrow, “I suppose you would not know… As part of my… our sacred task, Luna grants us the ability to see shapeshifting magic. In a Lycan like myself, our forms appear balanced. For an afflicted, it appears to be a mad beast clawing at the host… for her… I am not even certain what I saw. It.. they were… fused, melted, like… a jumbled mass of limbs and teeth…”</p>
    <p>She shudders, “I am sorry, it must sound insane. From her external appearance and behavior, she looked… like a normal lycanthrope. From what I could see… it was <i>wrong</i>.”</p>
    <p>She looks back to Hunger, “It must sound like religious zealotry to you, and I admit that I do not understand what I saw but… please believe me. There is something deeply, fundamentally horrifying about what she has done.” </p>
    <p>The Hunger shook his head. "I'll take your word on it; after all, you are the subject matter expert. And her solution was somewhat... hacked-together, anyway."</p>
    <p>Bryti glances at the corpse again, “Seems to be her general methodology.” </p>

    <h3>Addendum</h3>
    <p>It takes a few minutes for Terror and Bryti to recover from the injuries Cantia dealt them. The rest of the group happily leaves Hunger to clean up the mess Cantia’s clone left behind. After cleaning out the worst of the metal spikes and healing the wounds, Bryti asks Allophryne to go check the exits to make sure there isn’t anyone else trying to worm their way in.</p>
    <p>Now alone in a side room in the villa, Bryti finishes checking injuries then turns to the Terror.</p>
    <p>“I have to admit,” she says, “It is much better to fight beside you than in front of you.”</p>
    <p>Terror makes a noise similar to a grindstone rubbing against a cheese grater.</p>
    <p>Bryti gives Terror a quiet look. After a few moments, she appears to make a decision.</p>
    <p>"How did Dreyrugr die?" She asks in a whisper.</p>
    <p>“Biting,” Terror speaks with a hint of a shudder, “Screaming.”</p>
    <p>Bryti folds her arms. Her eyes narrow slightly. She gives a slight nod to Terror.</p>
    <p>Reluctantly and tersely, Terror describes the gruesome event. She describes how no one, not even the champions assembled, could stand toe to toe with the monster for more than a few seconds. How they were forced to overwhelm him with sheer numbers. How, even when under a pile of warriors brutally beating him with anything at hand, Dreyrugr continued to bite and tear off chunks with his teeth. How he tried to devour his enemies. How no one was sure who killed him because no one was sure when he died. How it seemed he was a snapping, hungry, screaming animal until all that was left was a brutalized pile of fur and gore.</p>
    <p>If Bryti senses the pain in Terror’s voice, she does not comment on it. Instead, she listens to the description with quiet intensity. When Terror finishes, Bryti’s shoulders slump.</p>
    <p>“I thought it would make me feel better,” she explains in a quiet voice, “To know that he died like a suffering beast, that his last moments were full of fear and agony… but it doesn’t, does it?” </p>
    <p>Terror slowly shakes her head, “Never will.”</p>
    <p>Bryti does not have anything to say to that.</p>
