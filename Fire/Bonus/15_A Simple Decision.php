<p><strong>Hunger-</strong> Deciphering Cantia's grocery lists can be a challenging task, much less her alchemical
    formulas. She is incredibly intelligent yes, but her questionably sane mind moves in such unpredictable and
    nonlinear ways that any particular train of thought is extremely difficult to follow. This is of course one of the
    reasons for her incredible talent - she really can see options and connections that no one else even considers. This
    formula appears to be the result of decades of work, beginning even before she started teaching him. It is perhaps
    her magnum opus, her greatest achievement, and it is frankly kind of horrifying.</p>
