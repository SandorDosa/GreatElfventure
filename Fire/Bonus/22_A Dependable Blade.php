    <h1>A Dependable Blade</h1>
    <p>“I’m telling you, there was a shark-elf-thing!” Cel says, shivering.</p>
    <p>The trio were huddled together on the edge of Smilisca’s raft, trying to stay under the roof as the raft rolled and jostled with the waves below. Wind tugged at their cloaks. Heavy storm clouds were rolling in above them. </p>
    <p>“It’s pretty lucky it didn’t come our way, though,” Cel said, wiping damp hair from in front of her face. “We would’ve had it for sure. And we got the dinghy back, which is the important part.” </p>
    <p>Nobody continued peering out into the roiling waves, eyes squinting in concentration.  “I’m sorry to say I saw nothing, Cel, but I do not doubt your word; had such a canny beast come towards us, we certainly would have perished.  Sharks are possessed of a sheer cunning… that’s the one with the pouch, correct?”</p>
    <p>Cel shakes her head. “Nah, they’re kind of a big, toothy fish from the ocean. I think. They’ve got skin as sharp as kni--”</p>
    <p>The sound of dishes clattering together rumbles through the curtain door into the raft’s house.</p>
    <p>Cel turns to look at Acris. “I thought your uncle said it was going to be a bit longer before he got back?” </p>
    <p>“Mais, maybe he didn’t want’a leave the raft too long with the big big weather comin’ in?”  Acris opens the curtain carefully.</p>
    <p>Inside he sees Terje, out of blade elf gear and wearing river elf clothes, complete with shorts, sandals, and a straw hat. The blade elf currently has his back to the group, and is trying to wrestle something out of the live well. </p>
    <p>Acris closes the curtain quietly.</p>
    <p>“Cel, you good t’ swim?” he offers a chance at escape, “Mr. Terje is here.”</p>
    <p>Cel sneezes. “No thanks,” she says, glancing back at the river. “Think I’m cold enough.” </p>
    <p>She sighs, and then raps on the wood beside the doorway. </p>
    <p>Looking uncertain, Nobody leans close to Acris, whispering.  “Who is Mister Ter?  Should I conceal myself?”</p>
    <p>“Non, Nobody,” Acris answers, “Mister Terje is dem Quartermaster at the Fort where we’re goin nex.  <small>Mais... we oughta give ‘em a minute.  He n’ Cel got stuff.</small>”</p>
    <p>"Hey Smil, sorry I haven't-" Terje pulls open the curtain. He blinks at where Smilisca's eye level should be, then tilts his head just slightly down at the group of teenagers.</p>
    <p>"Huh?" is all he manages. </p>
    <p>Cel tries to strike a confident pose… and promptly sneezes again. “Quartermaster,” she says, sniffing. </p>
    <p>Terje laughs and leans against the doorframe.</p>
    <p>"Just Terje here, Cel, I'm off duty," his tone is lighter than expected, "You doing okay? I was worried you'd run off into the desert or something until Ehra explained it." </p>
    <p>“Desert’s not so bad,” Cel says, avoiding his eyes. “Least its not cold. ...Sorry about your dinner, by the way.”</p>
    <p>"Oh it's okay, you didn't-" Terje glances back into the raft then blinks as he realizes what Cel is talking about, "Oh. <i>Oh,</i> right. That. I'd forgotten about that. Yeah, honestly it's probably karma.  You shoulda seen what <i>I</i> got up to when I was…"</p>
    <p>He glances at Acris who is desperately trying to be somewhere else.</p>
    <p>"There's something you want to talk to. Me about, Cel?" </p>
    <p>“I have a favor to ask,” Cel says, looking at him nervously. “I need your help fixing my sword.” </p>
    <p>Terje raises an eyebrow as Acris gently pushes Nobody away from the door.</p>
    <p>"Well, you better bring it inside so I can take a look at it," he says, "I have to finish making dinner anyway, c'mon."</p>
    <p>Terje ducks back under the curtain and heads back into the raft. </p>
    <p>Cel glances back at Acris, and shrugs. “Guess he’s… not as mad as I thought?”</p>
    <p>She heads inside, pulling her Lycan sword from its sheath, and holding it out sideways in Terje’s direction.</p>
    <p>As she enters the raft, she finds Terje oddly enough cutting up a fish with a plate of spices and herbs next to him. Not knowing what else to do, Cel simply walks over to Terje and holds it out to him. He pauses his cutting and looks it over with a critical eye.</p>
    <p>"Did you… try to cut a tree down with this thing?" </p>
    <p>“No,” Cel says. “<small>I succeeded.</small>”</p>
    <p>“Now Cel,” Terje does a poor job at suppressing a smile, “It’s fun to hack and slash at stuff with a sword, but a blade is more important than that. It’s no use repairing it if you’re just going to hack stuff up for fun.” </p>
    <p>There is a soft yawn from a puddle of blankets in the far corner of the room. The blankets rustle. A tiny hippo snout pokes its way out.</p>
    <p>Cel looks Terje straight in the eyes. “Look, it was the tree or the hippo. One of those two wasn’t <i>leaving</i> that swamp. Think I chose right.” </p>
    <p>“Wait, really?” Terje looks over at the tiny hippo, “So you cut down a tree so you could save Boots? Well, that’s one lecture sunk. You did choose right. I’m sorry I assumed. Here, let me take a closer look.”</p>
    <p>He holds out a hand for the blade. </p>
    <p>Cel hands it over, hilt first. “You’re fine; I was just being extra dramatic with it, anyway. Not about the tree -- we totally did that to rescue Boots. Just the overdramatic glaring.” </p>
    <p>“Fair enough,” he takes it by the hilt and takes a closer look at the blade, “I should be getting used to the drama, sure seems to be a lot of it flying around. Someone tried to use magic to fix the hilt?” </p>
    <p>“Nobody did,” she replies, looking at Terje expectantly. “<small>Come on, say it.</small>”</p>
    <p>“Nobody… huh?” Terje sighs, “Well whoever th--”</p>
    <p>“As in our new Crag crewmate with the name,” Cel says, sighing. “Gotta keep up, Quar-- Terje.” </p>
    <p>“That… is a very strange name,” Terje completes the sigh, “And yes, Cel, of course I’ll fix it. I’m gonna show you how I do it though, and when we’re done we’re going to have a <i>serious</i> talk about sword maintenance, okay?” </p>
    <p>“All right!” the Fire Elf says, smiling. “...Wait. This isn’t going to be one of those talks where I have to read through a scroll afterwards, is it? Because I’ll tell you right now, I’m notoriously lazy when it comes to reading things. <i>Notorious.</i>”</p>
    <p>“Nah,” Terje hands her the sword back, hilt first, “Swords are all practical. That’s why I like it. It’s a change of pace from all the damned paperwork.” </p>
    <p>Cel nods. “I can work with that. What do I gotta do?”</p>
    <p>“For right now?” Terje turns back to his food preparation as Cel takes the sword back, “Put that thing up and invite Nobody back in here, I’m making dinner. Or trying to. Is this… is this chili powder or paprika? Cayenne? I have no idea, but it’s making my eyes water. Uh, maybe you better go get Acris…” </p>
    <p>“‘Ts probably onion powder if its hurting your eyes,” Cel says, showing off her amazing skill at cooking. She turns back to the door. “Acris! Nobody! Terje’s cooking! You better get in here before it all mysteriously ends up in the kitchen, where he’d never look!”</p>
    <p>“It took me four hours to find it,” he grumbles, “But back when I was a cadet, I hid Warmaster Viirik’s favorite pipe in a rafter for six months. We’re on neutral ground, kid, but when you go back to training step up your game, scrub.” </p>
