<p><strong>Hunger-</strong> Deciphering Cantia's grocery lists can be a challenging task, much less her alchemical formulas. She is incredibly intelligent yes, but her questionably sane mind moves in such unpredictable and nonlinear ways that any particular train of thought is extremely difficult to follow. This is of course one of the reasons for her incredible talent - she really can see options and connections that no one else even considers. This formula appears to be the result of decades of work, beginning even before she started teaching him. It is perhaps her magnum opus, her greatest achievement, and it is frankly kind of horrifying.</p>
<p>The Hunger knows how his old master thinks. He has samples of her notes, some of which are directly related to this formula - the old musings on mutagens and the affliction. He's able to second guess how she thinks, anticipate her approach if not her conclusion. He's learned more about the affliction and how it works than ever before. With all of this at his disposal and a wellspring of willpower driving him on, he devotes perhaps his last months alive to deciphering the formula.</p>
<p>Circumstance Bonuses-</p>
<ol>
<li>Correct assumption, +2. The curse is divine, and can only be cured by divine means. With this knowledge, Hunger is able to work out something important early on - This is not a cure.</li>
<li>Good logic, but irrelevant, no change. It is indeed highly suspicious that the Tourist apparently hasn't even bothered to find out if he's afflicted or not after she bit him. It doesn't make sense that she wouldn't think of that, especially if she is here to hunt Afflicted. However, this has little to do with the task at hand.</li>
<li>Incorrect assumption, -2. The formula appears to have nothing to do with changing the type or subtype of the user. The Hunger wastes a fair bit of time trying to tie it to his former attempts to become draconic, with nothing to show for it.</li>
<li>Correct assumption, +2. Thankfully he picks it back up. Indeed, the formula begins by assuming the affliction is an inherent part of the user, and cannot simply be brushed off. Instead, it deals primarily with the transformation effect itself, and how it affects the user. Focusing on this allows the Hunger to eliminate some distractions.</li>
<li>Partially correct assumption, +1. The Hunger is incorrect in his conclusions on this point, but his assessments of her methods and mindset are spot on. After realizing that this formula makes no attempt to change the core nature of the user or draw from outside influences, he is forced to reassess his options. If outside influence isn't an option, then maybe she really does intend to alter personality with non-Bellaphexian traits. How would she do that, though? How would that even fit her world view?</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon examining her work as a whole, Hunger reaches his conclusion. If he hadn't managed to work out her thought process, he wouldn't even believe it. It's hard for him to believe that even <em>she</em> would be so mad.</p>
<p>Hunger's total Craft Alchemy Check: 39</p>
<p>DC set by Cantia's roll to create it: 38</p>
<p>The formula is a method to turn an afflicted lycanthrope into a natural one.</p>
<p>From a cut and dry perspective, it has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>DR 5/Silver in hybrid and animal form becomes DR/10 Silver</li>
<li>Changing shape no longer requires passing a fortitude save and can be done as a move action.</li>
<li>No longer automatically change shape during a full moon, or lose control/memories.</li>
<li>Gain Lycanthropic Empathy in humanoid form.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are two major components to how this would work:</p>
<ol>
<li>The concoction is relatively simple to make, however it must be taken on at least a monthly basis or the user risks reverting to acting as an Afflicted.</li>
<li>This concoction fully binds the curse to the user's self and permanently eliminates any chance of a cure. After the first time a user takes this concoction, the curse can no longer be removed by any mortal magic short of a <em>Wish </em>or <em>Miracle</em> (and even that could be dicey,) even if the user reverts to Afflicted status. Even death, reincarnation, or undeath might not remove the effects on his self.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where things get metaphysical, as the Hunger tries to discern what exactly this means for his personality and that of the Dog. Clearly, this would not entirely eliminate the Dog, but neither would it be allowed to receive complete control.</p>
<p>Cantia clearly seems to ascribe to the "evolved curse" theory of Lycanthropy, that so-called "natural" Lycanthropes are the descendants of afflicted Lycanthropes whose bodies and minds adapted to the curse over several generations. This concoction appears to attempt to replicate that process of adaptation, and implement it on a single individual.</p>
<p>Her formula attempts to find a stable balance between the "tumor" of the affliction and the host, then fully hybridize the two. Thankfully, she acknowledges the insidious nature of the curse and its resistance to being understood. That is why the formula must be custom tailored to an individual, then constantly tweaked and adapted over that individual's lifetime to prevent the curse from getting out of control again. Interestingly, Cantia's work never uses the word "soul" anywhere. She treats both the affliction and the user's self as powerful confluences of planar energies, and attempts to find balance and fusion between the two. The math seems to check out on that.</p>
<p>As far as his personality goes, he's not completely sure how it would work. He is certain it would not simply make him the Dog permanently. Most likely it would find an equilibrium between the two personalities and make him a gestalt result of the two entities. Also possible, since it attempts to eliminate the affliction entirely, it would simply eliminate the Dog and its impact on him. Probably not that lucky. Another possibility: it would remove the Dog's ability to control his actions but not remove the dog from his mind. He isn't sure which, but it definitely won't make him permanently chaotic evil. Regardless, if he ever slipped up and became Afflicted again, he believes there is a high chance the Dog would become the dominant personality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether or not the Hunger thinks this will work depends on 2 factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the Hunger believe that the curse and Lycanthropy are one and the same and the curse can be manipulated like any other effect, or that the nature of Lycanthropy is closer to the more divine and inscrutable construct that the Lycans believe in?</li>
<li>Does the Hunger think he's smart enough that he can successfully adapt his formula to the ever changing nature of the curse for the rest of his life?</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, the concoction itself is almost trivially easy to make. It requires only simple components and takes merely a day or two's work to create once you have completed the formula.</p>
<p>The Hunger, if he wishes, can choose to create this concoction and take it before the potluck.</p>
<p>What does he do?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Hunger <em>laughed</em>. Hard. So hard his breath caught in his lungs, his arms shook, and tears leaked from his eyes.</p>
<p>He leaned against his worktable, and waited for the shaking to subside before dropping his final notes onto a stack. "The sweet irony of it," he said, grinning. "Hooked forever on a monthly tincture to keep my karkinos of a dog in check. Forced to disguise my condition for a lifetime, behind makeup and masks. Transformed into a <em>Lycan</em>. In Surt. Terror will have a conniption." </p>
<p>He glanced over at the letter from Brighteye, still sitting on his desk.</p>
<p><em>You have to admit, it beats being dead.</em> </p>
<p>"That's more of a concern for you than for me," the Hunger said to himself. "I accepted that possibility long ago. And her formula has a chance to erase you entirely, if you recall."</p>
<p><em>Oh, I recall. I also might be relegated to a permanent annoying voice in the back of your head. Even then, I'm still you. I'd still exist, in some fashion. I'd rather lose and live than win and die.</em> </p>
<p><br />"And you know I can't say no to this," the Hunger said. "...Though it makes me yet another figure that could destroy Surt. Imagine what Tsun could do with this revelation. Imagine what Brighteye <em>can</em> do with this. She'll know I used it the moment I leave the potluck."</p>
<p><em>It's our most logical choice. It certainly beats suicide, not to mention the fallout from that. Worst case scenario for you, we end up right back where we were a few months ago.</em> </p>
<p>"Not quite," he said. "A few months ago, Brighteye was dead. Her and the governor and all the damned of Muspelham. If she's alive... If we-- <strong>I</strong> take this, I will owe her. But she's also a problem, waiting to happen." </p>
<p><em>We can't fight her if we're dead.</em> </p>
<p>Hunger nodded. "As usual, there never really was a choice. Too many risks to <em>not</em> take this chance. ...Let's get to work." </p>
<p><em>Of course. After all, who else but us could stop whatever madness Cantia is up to? </em></p>
<p>"Terror," the Hunger said. "When pointed in the right direction."</p>
<p>There was sudden uncertainty in the Dog's tone.</p>
<p><em>She's not smart enough. Cantia would have her chasing her tail. She needs us to point her in the right direction.</em> </p>
<p>"She handled the Coyotes with few issues," the Hunger said, deliberately continuing that line of thought. "Low casualties on all sides. A brilliant tactical maneuver -- and tactics has never been my forte. She's smarter than I give her credit for. And perceptive.</p>
<p>"And then there's the Fury. For all of her naivete and inexperience, there's a powerful mind in there -- buried under all the mistakes of a child, certainly, but a powerful mind. And one with more than enough firepower."</p>
<p>The Dog's tone starts to border on fear.</p>
<p><em>Powerful yes, but imprecise. Her firepower is useless if she can't track Cantia's insane thought processes. She has the will yes, but she'll need our reasoning. No one but us knows her well enough, or can even come close to matching her brilliance. </em></p>
<p>"Ah, but I doubt she's the one in control. She never had much interest in ruling. ...And then, of course, there's Barrabus. There's a hint of cleverness under all of his fluff. He demonstrated that when he worked his way back to the top of that overstuffed merchant's guild of his. Clever enough to catch up to whomever is backing Cantia, maybe." </p>
<p><em>Barrabus!?</em> The Dog's tone was tinted with rage and near panic, <em>Are you completely mad? No one can replace us! Surt </em><strong><em>will</em></strong><em> fall without us! You can't possibly </em><strong><em>still </em></strong><em>be considering - you have a chance to get everything you ever wanted!</em> </p>
<p>Beneath his mask, the Hunger grinned. "All <em>I</em> ever wanted? <em>Gaius</em> died at Muspelham. What he wanted is irrelevant. What <em>I </em>want is to make up for his mistakes. And if I give Cantia this edge over Surt, and set up another Lycan dictator out of myself, am I fixing his mistakes? Or <em>repeating</em> them?</p>
<p>"And what about <em>you</em>. You seem concerned. More so than ever. I thought you wanted Surt to thrive."</p>
<p><em>I do!</em> It snapped, <em>And I want to live to see it, and so do you! I am you! You can't lie to me. I know you're not certain they can stop her with you gone! I know you're worried the city will collapse without you holding it all together! Look at you! No one will even know how much you really did! You'll go down in history as a </em><strong><em>joke</em></strong><em> and Surt will go with you!</em> </p>
<p>"When have I ever cared if anyone knows what I did? Even when I was Gaius I cared nothing for that. Not as a tax assessor, and not as an alchemist. And definitely not now, as the Hunger." </p>
<p><em>You never cared, </em>the dog's voice was cold, <em>but I always wanted to. </em></p>
<p>"I didn't want to burn down my city, either. No one ever gets what they really want."</p>
<p><em>You can't be serious. You don't want to do this. You don't want to die. </em></p>
<p>"Correct," the Hunger said. "And if you hadn't opened your proverbial snout for pointless bragging, I'd be at work on Cantia's potion right now. But you did. You popped open Pandora's box, and released the monster at the bottom -- the one thing that could change my mind, and that weighs more on my thoughts than my desire to see Surt rise.</p>
<p>"Pure. Unadulterated. Spite."</p>
<p><em>Then in that case, let me show you mine.</em></p>
<p>The Dog surged in the Hunger's mind. He felt it like ice in his blood, like it was trying to tear through his skin. He gripped the table with white knuckles and fought it. His vision went blurry and his mind struggled against the torrent, but a tiny spark kept him conscious: Spite.</p>
<p>It's unorthodox, but it kept him in control. For now.</p>
<p><em>Let go, damn you! </em></p>
<p>"You let go, <em>Gaius</em>," the Hunger said. "This is <em>mine</em>. You want Surt to thrive? Die for it!"</p>
<p><em>I AM NOT GAIUS! I AM NOT THAT WEAK COWARD! DO NOT EVER CALL ME THAT!</em></p>
<p>The Dog's mind spirals in rage, but loses focus. The Hunger remains in control, but the Dog is just behind his eyes, howling and gnashing its teeth. </p>
<p>"So you want that weak coward to run Surt? You said yourself <em>you are me</em>. You <em>always wanted</em> recognition, so stand and be recognized. To save Surt, you must <em>die for it</em>. Say it with me now."</p>
<p><em>NO! </em></p>
<p>"Come on, Gaius. We were meant to die at Muspelham. We both know it. We left our grave behind to haunt our victims, and now the best thing we can do is <em>die</em> for them. Rest, Gaius. Say it with me. 'To save Surt, die for it.' Come on."</p>
<p><em>I will find a way, I will stop you from killing us! You are insane!</em> </p>
<p>"And if we drink the potion, I'll 'both' be insane. You won't be by yourself; I'll be in there, too. So stop me. There's only one way, and you know it." </p>
<p><em>No,</em> the Dog's voice had weakened. It sounded tired, but far from defeated, <em>There's not. There's what happens if I win. If I overwhelm you. It's not a fair fight. It's one you can't win. I said it before. You can't beat me, only make the transition messier. Now it is. I will tear you apart. </em></p>
<p>"Don't kid yourself, Freshleaf. You're still me. We'll spend three days tearing ourselves apart, get to the Potluck, and get <em>cut down like a dog </em>the moment we get in front of any of the others. The disguise barely lasted through the last potluck, and that was in Surt. What makes you think it'll last in front of all of them, as disheveled as we'll be after all that?<br /><br />"And then we get revealed. Chopped down. The others recognize that there was a Lycan leading the Fire Elves. And then the Blade Elves and River Elves <em>tear Surt apart</em>. You think they'll stand for a Lycan in Surt after the war? After all that implies? Our army is a hundred miles away. Blade Elves stand in our streets. Surt will get carved up like a <em>partridge</em>.</p>
<p>"So go ahead, make the transition mess. Deny your fate. Hide from it like a coward. Pretend you can make yourself something better. <em>Or</em> save this city. Die for it."</p>
<p><em>May the best dog win, meat. </em></p>
