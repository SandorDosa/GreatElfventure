        A Blade's Edge
    </title>

<body>
    <h1> A Blade's Edge</h1> 
    <p>Gerdr was a fairly normal village, in a 'half-constructed' way -- full of columns and rough walls made from the claylike stone "concrete" the Fire Elves seemed to favor, and lacking a bit in the way of amenities, completed buildings, and villagers. The Surtian soldiers standing guard at the would-be "dock" seemed tolerable, if a bit poorly disciplined, and the fortifications they were setting up within the village seemed adequate, though not particularly sturdy. </p>
    <p>The road to Surt also did little to impress Villhook. The Marr was a harsh land, and even with a road, the heat and strange odors made for an uncomfortable twenty-mile hike. It was only when the forward ranks reached the edge of the valley that Villhook considered changing his opinion.</p>
    <p>The town was in full bloom; its rooftops were awash in flowers, lit up by the dozens of technicolor fires glowing in contrast to the reddened sun setting to his left. It looked like a rainbow trapped in a soap bubble, halo'd by grey smoke above it, and a thick, plaster-white wall running around its edge.</p>
    <p>Captain Villhook frowned, which did not express disapproval so much as that's what his face did when he was thinking. It was going to be a long season, and the next few minutes would frame it. Relations are tense already, and he was not a diplomat. How, exactly, does one march 400 troops into a city and not look like an occupation?</p>
    <p>He instructed his warchanter to call an easy march. He had ordered his soldiers to travel with their helmets in their packs, swords sheathed, and shields on their backs. He traveled the same, on foot next to his warchanter and bannerelf. Not that they had any horses left anyway.</p>
    <p>The war chanter began a cadence of "Oh we of steel forged," the closest thing he could think of to a non-threatening chant. Better than "With blood we sow" or "Wolfsbane" anyway. The relaxed cadence allowed his soldiers to move with a professional bearing, but not look like they're either parading or assaulting. He hoped. Villhook frowned. He hated politics.</p>
    <p>As they approached the gates, Villhook saw standing by the front gates. Someone in a red and purple chiton, and a bronze halfmask with flames carved into the top, by a dozen soldiers in assorted uniforms. </p>
    <p>Villhook glanced up. The soldiers manning the walls were watching the Blade Elves with obvious nervousness, but their weapons were sheathed. </p>
    <p>"Captain Villhook!" the Fury said, waving. The soldier to her right -- a barrel-chested elf in blue, with a bronze breastplate -- visibly stifled a grimace. She swept up to the approaching Blade Elf line, guards trailing behind her.</p>
    <p>"The walk from Gerdr wasn't too terrible, was it?" she said. She gestured to the elf in blue. "This is Captain Doukas, head of the Constabulary Guard. You'll be coordinating with him for the city's defense, and the Constabulary Guard will be working with your soldiers to make sure your stay is comfortable."</p>
    <p>Captain Doukas gave Villhook an embarrassed look, like that of a parent pleading with someone to tolerate their child's increasingly embarrassing antics. He extended a hand. "Pleasure to meet you, Captain."</p>
    <p>Captain Villhook gave Doukas' hand an awkward look. Villhook had already stood at full attention with a textbook military salute. Well, no turning back now. Villhook cleared his throat.</p>
    <p>"Hail to the Fury of the Triumvirate and Captain Doukas of the Constabulary Guard. I present to you Bravo Division, all present and accounted for in good order. By leave of Warmaster General Katiin Paavi, I hereby request permission for Bravo Division to enter Surt and to present to you our command banner, so that Bravo Division will be under the command of the Triumvirate for the duration of our deployment."</p>
    <p>His bannerelf passed him the dark blue banner of Bravo division. With practiced ceremony, he presented it… somewhere between Fury and Doukas. Did these people not know the right procedure? Passing off control of an entire division of soldiers was not so simple as walking up to the gate and saying hello.</p>
    <p>"Er," Villhook cleared his throat again, "Bravo Division is prepared for inspection if you deem it necessary." </p>
    <p>Doukas' lips pursed, disappearing beneath his mustache. His brow furrowed.</p>
    <p>"...Right," the Fury said, frowning slightly. "Thanks? Thanks. Let's--"</p>
    <p>"Hail to you, Captain Villhook of Bravo Division," Doukas stated; his eyes were glazed, as if he was dredging something ancient from the bottom of his memories. “By leave of the Terror, the Fury, and the Hunger of the Triumvirate, and on behalf of the Triumvirate of Surt, I accept your command banner and grant permission to enter Surt after inspection."</p>
    <p>He gave Villhook a sharp salute, underlit by an exasperated glare, and snapped up Bravo Division's banner. "Please proceed with the inspection, Captain," he said.</p>
    <p>Villhook narrowed his eyes slightly, but otherwise didn't change his demeanor.</p>
    <p>"Of course, Captain," He said curtly.</p>
    <p>Captain Villhook turned towards Bravo Division and folded his arms behind his back.</p>
    <p>"Present arms!" He bellowed, "Captains! Inspect your centuries! Sargeants! Inspect your squadrons! Open ranks!"</p>
    <p>There is a clatter as the blade elves draw their weapons. There is something of a fumble as they take their helmets out of their packs, but other than that it's a smooth shift. The soldiers stand in wide ranks, with their officers passing through inspecting each soldier.</p>
    <p>Villhook himself put his helmet on. He turned towards the fire elves and drew that thin two-handed sword that the blade elves insist on calling a longsword. There is palpable tension from the fire elves as the blade elf draws his weapon well within striking distance of the Fury.</p>
    <p>Villhook runs his fingers along the immaculate silversheen blade. He turns the blade vertical, with the crossguard in front of his face. He tilted the hilt downwards, offering it to the Fury.</p>
    <p>"Every inspection should begin with the highest ranking officer," he states, "For your approval, Sir." </p>
    <p>The Fury blinked. </p>
    <p>Captain Doukas glanced sideways at the Fury, and quickly waved the battlefield hand signals for "not understood" in Villhook's direction, followed by gesturing sideways towards the Fury. He then also -- quickly, so that Villhook and only Villhook would see it -- quietly flipped a middle finger in the captain's direction.</p>
    <p>"...Approved?" the Fury said, clearly trying to recover the situation. She glanced over at Captain Doukas.</p>
    <p>"At ease, Cap--" he whispered through the side of his mouth.</p>
    <p>"At ease, Captain," the Fury said, her dignity now mostly back in place. "...Please proceed with the inspection."</p>
    <p>A few of the ‘soldiers’ at the back of the Fury's procession sniggered. </p>
    <p>The half-dozen Surtians in bronze and blue were at full attention, albeit pointing a glare or two in Villhook's direction. The other half-dozen, in a smattering of odd uniforms that only vaguely resembled the term, were... "standing around" at best. Only a couple of them were giving the inspection any attention; the others were either glazed over, or in two cases, quietly chuckling at the Fury's embarrassment.</p>
    <p>Villhook looked back and forth between the Fury and Doukas with a frown. He smartly sheathed his sword and saluted.</p>
    <p>"Thank you Fury," he removed his helmet and set it at his waist.</p>
    <p>He pauses for a moment, then says, "I would like you both to walk with me so that you may be introduced to Surt's temporary defenders." </p>
    <p>"Thank you," the Fury said. "That would be wonderful!"</p>
    <p>She waited for Villhook to move, and then stepped in close beside him. Doukas marched after her, staying about a pace behind and to her right.</p>
    <p>Villhook leads the group through a basic inspection. This mostly consists of stepping up to the other Captains leading the four centuries, exchanging a little "Century one report," "Century one reports all present and accounted for" and so forth. The swordelves appear to be in good order, if a bit sweaty from the Maar's climate.</p>
    <p>Doukas can tell that Villhook is moving through the inspection at a brisk pace. He goes through the protocol, but only the strictly necessary. Once the last century has been inspected, he turns to the fire elves </p>
    <p>"Fury, Captain, is Bravo Division in order well enough to meet your needs?" </p>
    <p>"Hold, Villhook," Doukas said sharply. "I'm not finished with your fourth century here--"</p>
    <p>"Quite satisfied, thank you, Captain," the Fury said. She gave Doukas a raised eyebrow.</p>
    <p>Doukas snapped his mouth shut, and then gave the Fury a sharp salute. His eyes stayed on Villhook. "Shall we proceed inside, your grace?" he said.</p>
    <p>The Fury nodded. "Its getting late," she said, glancing over to the Blade Elf captain. "And I bet you want a chance to set up your lodgings before dark. We'll need you to secure your weapons before entering the city -- 'peace ties', right Captain Doukas?"</p>
    <p>Doukas nodded. "Visible ones. Your soldiers may keep their weapons free while on-duty, but all weapons must have visible peace ties with a two-knot minimum when carried by off-duty personnel. If necessary, we can supply you with ropes and ties fit to our standards. I must also require that off-duty personnel keep their helmets off while on the streets of Surt; armor is fine, and in the barracks or the parade ground is fine, but I want your faces uncovered while you are on my streets. I must also recommend that you travel in groups, with a Constabulary Guard escort for officers or groups of two or less. We have enough trouble with espionage as it is without “random new faces” wandering about.</p>
    <p>"After you are situated, my men will provide a sitrep to your troops to give them a better idea of the tactical and civil situations around Surt. I will also assign a pair of Guard officers to be available at the barracks at all times, to assist your soldiers in any way that is necessary."</p>
    <p>"Understood and acknowledged," Villhook nods, "I will instruct my officers to prepare for a briefing from your men. They will be treating your requirements as if Ehra himself gave them come tomorrow morning. We have leather straps for peace ties. If that is not acceptable, we will use whatever you required."</p>
    <p>He turned back to his soldiers, "At ease! Arms aside! Marching ranks! Helmets off!"</p>
    <p>The blade elves begin returning to the formation they arrived in. Villhook watches them for a few moments before turning back to Fury and Doukas.</p>
    <p>"Bravo Division is yours for the duration," he speaks in a low voice, "We will follow your order to the letter. And speaking of that… once our soldiers are settled, I believe we need to have a chat about our command structure."</p>
    <p>He pauses, "Er, to prevent unnecessary miscommunications."</p>
    <p>"Of course," the Fury said. "We can go over everything at dinner. I'd like to invite you and your senior officers to a dinner at the palace, with Captain Doukas and his senior officers, and a few Praesidium representatives. And myself, obviously. And probably also the Hunger, if he's not tied up with some experiment or something."</p>
    <p>"You should precede them inside, your grace," Doukas said. "My men and I will help Bravo Division set themselves up at the Barracks."</p>
    <p>The Fury nodded. "Quite right, Captain." She turned, and started sweeping back towards the city; the half-dozen guards in odd uniforms fell in behind her. "Dinner will be two hours after sundown, Captain Villhound," she said, turning back to face the two Captains just long enough to present them both with a smile. "I'll see you then!"</p>
    <p>Doukas watched the Fury for a few seconds, and then turned back to Villhook. "This way, soldier," he said mildly, before turning and marching after her.</p>
    <p>Surt's streets were crowded with onlookers -- gawping civilians, glaring 'soldiers' in mishmashed uniforms, firedancers, smoke magicians, nervous constables, street vendors hawking to the distracted crowds... it seemed as if the whole town had turned out to watch, and had lit every fire in every different color in order to get a better view of the Blade Elf soldiers marching ominously into their town.</p>
    <p>The barracks was surprisingly tame in comparison. It was a squat, wide building at the base of the Palace, walled off from the Agora by thick concrete. Rows of flowering grape and olive plants jutted from its roof. The parade ground was walled in beside it, with an exercise yard off to one side, lined with gravel.</p>
    <p>Captain Doukas stopped by the gate, where a few more blue-and-bronze soldiers were waiting. He turned to Villhook, and gave him a salute, with only a trace of a sardonic grin below it. "The Surt Primary barracks is yours, Captain," he said, before gesturing to the gate's doors.</p>
    <p>“Thank you, Captain,” Villhook returned the salute smartly, “I will prepare for, ah, dinner.”</p>
    <p>If there’s a little bit of a smirk at that, Villhook’s face is too severe to show it.</p>
    <p>Doukas hesitated. "If you have a moment, Villhook, I have a matter we should discuss in private. We can discuss it now, or, if you need time to properly entrench your men, we can meet at my office, before the dinner starts. Inspector Stormbadger can escort you." He gestured to one of the soldiers by the gate -- a tall elf with a bushy red mustache.</p>
    <p>Villhook gives a nod to the Inspector, but walks towards Doukas.</p>
    <p>“My officers can handle this, for the time being. What do you have?”</p>
    <p>"Over here, if you please," Doukas said. "We need a good view of the main square."</p>
    <p>He marched over to the edge of the Agora -- staying in sight of the Blade Elves, but well away from easy earshot -- and turned so his back was to the troops entering the barracks. He waited until Villhook had caught up to him, and then spoke quietly, without turning his head. "Captain, do you make it a habit of embarrassing your allies?"</p>
    <p>“No,” He answers, “Do you make a habit of not briefing your politicians on procedures they’ll be expected to know?”</p>
    <p>"I did not expect you to assume you had to go through formal military-to-military turnover procedure with our civilian government, yes. I assumed you would have realized that when you learned that all of our actual military is over two hundred miles away. Or that you would have been tipped off by the handshake. My mistake."</p>
    <p>Doukas sighed. "I know 'civilian culture' is new to you, and I mean no offense, but Kreist, Villhook, the Fury was wearing evening dress. You can't tell me you considered her 'in uniform'."</p>
    <p>Villhook frowns, then shrugs, “Ah, fair enough. I know you know blade elf military procedure, Doukas. I made an assumption you would have explained it to her. It was wrong. I am not a man of politics.”</p>
    <p>Villhook pauses, “Commander Kirill was ill. We did not have time for him to recover before Bravo deployed. He’s supposed to be in command of Bravo. I am the only one who was available. I’m a Captain in charge of four other Captains, and now answering to another Captain. Confusing to anyone. You and I, we must learn to live with each other. Too much at stake, yes?”</p>
    <p>He pauses again, "And in truth, with what I have seen of fire elves, an evening dress being a formal uniform would not be unbelievable."</p>
    <p>Doukas chuckled. "I'll take that as a compliment to our collective sense of fashion. ...And I apologize for... flipping you off earlier. The Fury is eccentric, but young, and she means well. It’s hard not to be a little protective of her.</p>
    <p>"Besides, it could have been worse. And I bet Commander Kirill would have been even less pleased than you are to be 'answering' to a captain -- much less a captain of the town guard. 'Once an MP, always an MP' means a bit less when you're not even in a standing division any longer." </p>
    <p>Villhook's scowl relaxed bit, "That is the truth, yes. There are so few of us left, and we are not out of the dark yet. I think I want to be on the side of the ones who can light themselves on fire when we are lost in the dark, yes?"</p>
    <p>Villhook offered a hand to Doukas, "Whatever else happens here, you and I must work together," his scowl twisted to something that might be a smirk, "And I think I can learn to work with an undisciplined pog MP. Only for the greater good."</p>
    <p>Doukas took Villhook’s hand, and shook it. "And I can learn to work with an over-starched ponce. For the greater good, as you put it."</p>
    <p>"Yes," Villhook's frown returns, "But I am still wearing armor to dinner. I have heard stories of how fire elves act at parties."</p>
    <p>"That would be Ashwalker Tsun," Doukas said. "And you should, because she will be there. Plus, it will help get the message across to the other Civile Praesidium leaders that you mean business. Anything we can do to keep them listening to us and not her." </p>
    <p>Villhook grunts, "Fucking politics… Captain, I believe I need to return to my men so that I can brief them on your instructions, and prepare my sanity for this dinner."</p>
    <p>He nods, "We will make it happen." </p>
    <p>Doukas nodded. "We will. Good luck, Captain." </p>
    <p>And with that, the captain of the Constabulary Guard turned, gave Villhook a salute, and marched off towards the palace.</p>
    <p>Villhook watched Doukas leave. After the other Captain was gone, he took a minute or two to look over the Agora and the strange, colorful, and vibrant place that it was now his responsibility to protect. The Constabulary Guard were supposed to be the stable, reasonable ones and look how that had started off. He cannot shake the feeling that he is absolutely the wrong man for the job.</p>
    <p>No, he told himself, there is no place for doubt. Only do what needs to be done.</p>
    <p>Captain Villhook turned towards the barracks to brief his soldiers. He needed to prepare for what would doubtlessly turn out to be the most stressful months of his life, as well as a dinner party.</p>
    <p>Politics.</p>
