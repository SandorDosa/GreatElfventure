    <h1>A Hitchhiker in Partager</h1>
    <p>Ink, returning with Smilisca’s Spellbook, also comes with Barrabus in tow.</p>
    <p>Barrabus, of course, is absolutely adamant that Ink just randomly kidnapped him. Ink comments little on this before teleporting away, leaving poor Barry apparently stranded. </p>
    <p>And Barrabus, being the person that he is (i.e. someone not inclined to owe people money when he can avoid it), shrugs and passes Smilisca twenty gold. "Would not want you to think I would skip town without paying my due," he said mildly.</p>
    <p>Smilisca is happy to have both his spellbook and his 20 gold.  Unfortunately, he’s currently also hitchhiking onboard with one of the Crocodilians, and can’t offer Barry a place to stay.  Staurois steps up to invite him in to the raft he and his wife share.</p>
    <p>The porch on the stern of the little houseboat has a handy shelf for storing ones sandals to prevent tracking mud aboard the burnished smooth plank floor.</p>
    <p>“Come’on and rest a’while,” Staruois invites.</p>
    <p>Barrabus bowed, and slipped his sandals onto the shelf. "Where are we off to next, if I may ask. Also, where are we now? Because seriously, I have no idea where we are."</p>
    <p>"We're headed East, inta' a marshlan' where we're 's'pose to do a deal wi' some Crag Elves withou' actually stumblin' inta their territory," Staurois explains, while leading Barrabus through the house boat's back curtain. The interior is homey, with hammocks hanging from hooks on the walls, an alligator hide rug, and a couple chests with the family's few possessions inside. A silvered two-pronged spear hangs on brackets over the back door, Barrabus would recognize it as having been the weapon of a Behemoth-rider. There is a bucket on the floor near one of the hammocks.</p>
    <p>"Ri' naw, we're a bi' East an downstream from Surt. We were s'posed to be startin' the overland bit of the trip tomorrow, but Smilisca's got us rerouted down close to tha coast afore then.”</p>
    <p>"Sounds lovely," Barrabus said, dropping onto a nearby hammock. "A nice, long trip to the beach. It will be more than a month before we're anywhere near Surt again, yes?"</p>
    <p>"I apologize for the imposition, but if it can't be helped, it can't be helped. I suppose I'll just have to," he yawns, "sit tight and hope for the best."</p>
    <p>Staurois pulls a blanket out and tucks it around the fire elf.  “Sleep tigh’,” he whispers gently.</p>
    <p>At some point in the middle of the night, Barrabus wakes up to the sound of retching.  He blearily looks around, and spots Ny, who he hasn’t properly been introduced to yet, vomiting into the bucket.  Staurois is gently holding her hair back. </p>
    <p>Pleasantly surprised that no one actually bothered him or kicked him out, Barrabus twisted quietly out of the hammock and rolled onto the balls of his feet, carefully keeping himself out of Ny and Staurois' line of sight. He sidled carefully and quietly over to the door [Stealth total: 30], and stole a quick peek outside, before turning back and taking a look at the two River Elves currently awake. </p>
    <p>Staurois helps Ny get back up onto the hammock and heads into the front room with the bucket.  Ny sits on the hammock looking queasy, just breathing carefully and trying not to move too much.  She doesn’t notice Barrabus.</p>
    <p>Barrabus took a quick second to examine Ny, concluding rapidly that she is 'several sheets to the wind', and would likely not appreciate being asked where to find more alcohol (or at least not right now). Instead, Barrabus slipped out through the back curtain, stopping to take in the view for a few seconds before meandering quietly back around the outside of the house. He stopped at the corner, and peered over at the oarsman's post.</p>
    <p>Staurois emerges from inside the raft, and collects some river water while cleaning the bucket.  He finishes his task without interruption and heads back inside without noticing Barrabus.</p>
    <p>Barrabus debated briefly whether or not he should ask Staurois about Ny before he disappeared, but decided instead to take advantage of this newly-opened opportunity. It was a beautiful, warm night, and the stars far above were clear and cold like sapphires -- a massive improvement over the faint, smoke-obscured pinpoints of Surt's summer nights. And what better place to enjoy it than the Oarsman's seat, just behind the... fat scaley beastie currently pulling the boat. </p>
    <p>It didn't look *a lot* like a dragon, but it was dark colored, scale-covered, and smart enough to pull a riverboat. Best not to offend it.</p>
    <p>"Pardon me, Staurois," Barrabus said quietly, stepping neatly through the curtain into the house's front room. "Who is that pulling your vessel?"</p>
    <p>Staurois steps back into the front room, bucketless now, and sets to work prepping a mug of tea.  He fumbles a bit with starting the fire in the infrequently used brazier for the kettle.  The room is clearly multipurpose.   There are cabinets bolted onto the walls, their doors held shut with latches.  There’s a low table near the center of the room, and counter space near a window where the little metal bowl holds some small amount of fuel that he is trying to set alight.  No chairs, but those would be a hassle if there were dangerous currents.</p>
    <p>Someone has decorated the room with assorted turtle shells full of growing herbs and colorful scarves hanging from the rafters.  One of the scarves is currently in use by a tiny caiman, apparently using it as a familiar-sized hammock.</p>
    <p>“Sorry, dinn’a see you thar,” he mumbles quietly, clearly a bit distracted.  “That’s Pierre.  Raised ‘im from en egg, weh.”</p>
    <p>"Let me help you with that," Barrabus said. He dropped a finger into the brazier, lighting it with a yellow spark. "So is he considered a wyrmling, or is this more the young adult stage? I'm afraid I don't know a lot about dragons and their ilk."</p>
    <p>“Mais, that’s a good one!”  Staurois laughs heartily.  “Pierre, a dragon!”  He puts the kettle on the little brazier and starts shaving a bit of some sort of root into it.  Smells like ginger.</p>
    <p>“Nah, cousin, that’s en alligator, a be it a might chubby one a that.”</p>
    <p>"An alligator," Barrabus said. "I don't think I've ever seen one before. You think he'll mind if I take a seat at the reins, as it were? Its a beautiful night, and try to make a habit of getting to know the vessel I'm on." </p>
    <p>“Weh, but don’ feed ‘im nuthin.  I’ll be ri’ back.”  Staurois stows the remaining ginger and brings a mug of tea into the sleeping room.</p>
    <p>Barrabus can hear the couple talking, but their words are muffled by the curtains.  Staurois returns after the brief exchange, looking a bit worried.  The tiny caiman drops onto his shoulder as he passes underneath its hammock.</p>
    <p>Sensing potential adventure and wanting none of it, Barrabus decided to head things off at the pass. He presented Staurois a raised eyebrow. "I think I could manage the reins for a bit if you want to keep an eye on her," he said mildly. </p>
    <p>“Weh?”  Staurois looks from Barrabus to the sleeping gator.  “Oh.”  He senses the excuse.  “No.  As she remin’ me, bein’ a battlefield medic ain’t the same as bein’ an actual midwife.”  He sighs, and looks up at the stars.  “Sure is a lot we don’ know.”</p>
    <p>"Indeed," Barrabus said, scribbling over several parts of a mental checklist. His mind rolled over to page two. "Congratulations. That's… pretty far from my field of expertise as well. Farther than it is from yours, probably."</p>
    <p>“Thanks, cousin.”  Staurois gives the fire elf a grin.  “Mais, can ya keep it a secret fer a while?  Still waitin’ to make sure errythin’s gon be okay.  Real risky righ’ now.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus snapped a sharp grin back, while his mind filed this particular page under "no friggin idea". "Won't say a thing," he said, stepping back out onto the front of the boat. </p>
    <p>He dropped into the oarsman's seat, scooted the reins over, and gave the 'alligator' (or perhaps 'Alley Gater', as in some type of city guard-reptile?) a quick once-over. "Ho there, Pierre," he said. "Just wanted to inform you that your captain, Staurois, has granted me permission to view the passage from the 'forecastle', as it were. Don't worry, I won't interfere with your navigation; just say the word, and I'll help any way I can."</p>
    <p>He then leaned back, propping his arms on the back of the chair, and let himself take in the night sky, the gentle swish of the waves, the cool ripple of the wind. "Halfcock's," he whispered to himself. "No, Winebat's. With a bit of that cheese they used to make too. Follow it up with an eclair as sweet as..." He sniffed. "Well, sweeter than swamp air, that's for sure."</p>
    <p>The summer passes with a slow comfort.  The days are spent riding river currents, and each evening begins with a soft chorus of music that filters from the back of the flotilla to the Ranidae Family raft at its front.  Not much is asked of the guest until they reach the coast.  On the ocean, close to the dangerous crash of breakers on the shore, they request his assistance in keeping watch for any dastardly Sea Elves or sharks that may be lurking in the dark waters below.</p>
    <p>Ny’s discomfort seems to have started to get better towards the end of the season, roughly around the same time that they’ve headed upriver into the coastal marsh toward the Crag Elves’ marked territory.  In the upriver journey, river elves spend time collecting shellfish, planting garlic and wolfsbane, and pickling fish in rice vinegar.  By the time they reach the Crag Elves, they’ve collected a fair amount of food to offer as their portion of the bargain with the Blade Elves.</p>
    <p>The trade with the crag elves goes awkward, but well. The river elves are basically forced to instruct the crag elves in just about all the basics of any kind of actual pragmatic mercantilism. Thankfully, Starois is just the elf for the job and his pleasant patience sees even the most confused crag - like poor Slabal - through.</p>
    <p>Ink shows up around this time, asking for the feather from the crag elves. He spends several days enchanting it. When he’s done, he seeks out Barrabus.</p>
    <p>“Have fun?” He asks the bard. </p>
    <p>"Indeed, dear sir," Barrabus said amicably. "Though I suppose with you here, I should probably get back to Surt, before I become a River Elf myself."</p>
    <p>"And truth be told," he whispered, leaning in towards the much taller elf, "My friends here are running a bit low on my preferred wine." </p>
    <p>“Okay.”</p>
    <p>“Now if you don’t mind I--” Barry said, just before being grabbed and teleported by Ink. </p>
