<p><strong>Mental- </strong>The Fury has gone past frustrated and has landed in straight up depressed.</p>
<p>She set her sights at a very reasonable level this time. She didn&rsquo;t attempt to improve the ritual she had been given at all. Hells, she tried to make it <em>simpler</em>, and yet for some reason she just&hellip; can&rsquo;t&hellip; get it to work!</p>
<p>Honestly it&rsquo;s probably something small. Some small detail she&rsquo;s missing that is preventing things from coming together. She just plain can&rsquo;t figure out <em>what</em> though, and she feels like wolf elves are staring at her from every corner and giggling at her incompetence. Finding out that fucking <em>Cantia</em> survived of all people, and now Tsun chased off Katya&hellip; Tourist&hellip; wolf lady, who had actually been making her feel <em>safer</em> but fucking <em>Tsun</em> had to fuck that up, and she drank <em>ghoul booze, </em>and <em>Hunger still hasn&rsquo;t fucking apologized for hiding the fact that he was a werewolf for over two years. </em>She&rsquo;s even been having nightmares about Governor Fuckface giving her that patronizing smile, the bastard doesn&rsquo;t even say anything just <em>ugh</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when she wakes up from one of those nightmares after having apparently shot off a fireball in a hypnagogic jerk that she realizes that she may be overly stressed out. As the burning cinders of her meager research flutter around her lab like so much snow she collapses on her desk sobbing. Whatever she had on that ritual is now gone.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, something occurs to her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s alone in here.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s <em>always </em>alone in here.</p>
<p>She has no one else to bounce questions off of, or help double check her work, or just come up with ideas. Her ritual team helps cast, but they all look to her for actually developing and leading the rituals. She&rsquo;s doing all this on her own, and maybe it&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;s not a miserable failure idiot girl. Maybe she just&hellip; needs help.</p>

<p id="FuryLetter">Dearest Ink,</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">It has been a while since I last heard from you! I hope this letter finds you well.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">&hellip;To be honest, I hope this letter finds you at all. I'm not certain the new "Post" system delivers to your home as of yet, and I rather imagine you won't let them build an office anytime soon.</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">I write to you in the hopes that you might have some insight into a ritual that I have been working on. I've hit a few snags in my research, and since you are an expert at such magic and an incredible spellcaster, I was hoping you would be willing to visit and assist me with it.</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">Please give your sister my regards.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">Fondly yours,</p>
<p id="FuryLetter">Fury</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Fury plopped onto the sofa and grabbed the box of spiral cookies off the floor beside it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had called off the night's research meeting specifically for this -- a chance to lie around on her sofa for the night, with no work, no appointments or meetings, and no interruptions beyond the occasional need to scrape crumbs out of her scroll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She shoved a cookie halfway into her mouth, then dropped the box onto her stomach and pulled a scroll out from her bathrobe pocket. She flicked the top of the scroll open, unrolling it onto the top of the cookie box. Woodcut images of wolves and masked elves stared out at her.</p>
<p>As she quietly read through the scroll, she slowly became aware of a slight annoyance. There were already crumbs piling up on the scroll. She gently flicked them off. She blinked. They were slowly dropping onto the page. From above her. Startled, Fury looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sup, Sparky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skulk was casually leaning over the back of the couch, staring at her and munching one of her cookies.</p>
<p>"YEEP!"</p>
<p>Fury rolled automatically off the sofa, scattering scroll and cookies to the floor. A wave of orange-yellow-white rolled from her fingertips. The cryptid opened her mouth as if to say something, but only managed to choke out a startled and inelven high pitched noise before the rolling spray of fire hit her. Fury didn&rsquo;t see where she landed, only heard a thump followed by a groaning noise and a smell like burning hair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury blinked. "...Skulk?"</p>
<p>She rolled over, and peered under the couch.</p>
<p>Skulk was splayed out in a pile of limbs on the other side of the couch. While it was difficult to tell the difference with her ash-colored skin, she was covered in sooty burn marks. Her hair was gently on fire. She coughed slightly, releasing a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang, Sparky.&rdquo; she rasped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury's eyes went wide. "Oh my god!" she said. "I'm so sorry! I didn't -- here, hold still! I can fix this!" She shoved both hands under the couch, and spread her fingers out into a fan shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woah wait nonotmorefire!&rdquo; Skulk cantilevered herself onto her elbows and scrambled away from Fury awkwardly, &ldquo;<em>Shit</em>, Sparky, sorry!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Wait! I'm going to heal you!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skulk stopped crab-spider crawling away, &ldquo;Huh, really?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury nodded, and scrambled back to her feet. "Its kind of my thing. Just hold still for a second, and&hellip; try not to breathe this."</p>
<p>Another wave of technicolor fire shot from her fingertips. Skulk surprisingly winced a little bit as the second wave of fire hit her, but held still. As it passed, she opened her eyes and dusted some of the charring off. Fury couldn&rsquo;t see any major injuries, but there were still some lighter and darker colored blotches on her forearms. Is that what a burn looks like on a cryptid? Fury had no idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, alright,&rdquo; Skulk rolled up to a sitting position, &ldquo;Next time I&rsquo;ll knock, jeeze.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Sorry&hellip;" Fury said, wincing. "I've&hellip; been a bit stressed out recently." A third wave of fire shot out of her hands. "I'm usually a little better about this sort of thing."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skulk visibly forced herself to sit still as the <em>third</em> wave of fire hit her. After it passed, she ran her hands over her arms briefly then grumbled and patted her still sizzling hair. She dusted herself off and stood with her best attempt at dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t worry about it Sparky,&rdquo; she shrugged, &ldquo;I earned that one. I fuck with people enough, I should be on my toes when they fuck with me back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If it helps, you surprised the Abyss out of me," Fury said. "Worse than when your brother popped in on me last time. Care for a cookie? They're from the best bakery in&hellip;" she glanced back at the sofa, and then to the cookie box, lying upside-down on the floor. "Damnit."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Nah, I can&rsquo;t actually eat &lsquo;em,&rdquo; Skulk commented, &ldquo;I was just messing with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She exhaled a little bit. The cryptid reached under one of the silk wraps she was wearing and held out the folded letter that Fury had sent for Ink. Suspiciously, the seal was broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was actually gonna let you know. Ink&rsquo;s outta town. I&rsquo;ll give him this when he gets back, but it&rsquo;ll be a few months.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury sighed. "I was hoping to get his help on a ritual I've been fighting with. He's really good with divination, and I'm absolutely terrible at it." She slumped backwards onto her couch. "Completely terrible. Miserable. Months of work, down the drain, because I can't figure out what every other mage in hundreds of miles can apparently make up in a week. ...And can't go a week without setting everything on fire, apparently."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skulk paused, then chuckled a bit. She stood up, walked towards one of the other chairs in the room, then sort of draped herself over it. She looked over at Fury with a smirk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know much about wizard shit, Sparky, but ho boy, when it fucks up it fucks up. Seriously, Ink plays all high and mighty, but I can definitely tell ya that you have not fucked as hard as he has fucked up in the past.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I gave myself a migraine for three months."</p>
<p>&ldquo;He blew up his house with a <em>scry.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury blinked. "...How?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck if I know!&rdquo; Skulk made a few gestures with her hands, &ldquo;He blew out my eardrums with that, too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...So what I'm hearing is that 'divination is dangerous, and sensible people don't bother with it'," Fury said. "Was it for a ritual, at the very least? Or was he just trying out a <em>scry</em> one day, and reality decided he didn't need a house anymore?"</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got no idea,&rdquo; Skulk shrugged, &ldquo;All I know was I came to talk to him one day and he had painted wizard shit all over his house, then he was like&hellip;&rdquo; Skulk makes an exaggerated mimic of her brother&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;&lsquo;Watch out Skulk I&rsquo;m about to do something really stupid and solve all my problems with ridiculously overkill powerful magic as usual, catch me if I have a seizure,&rsquo; and I was like what, and then&hellip;&rdquo; she makes a <em>poof</em> noise and gestures with her hands, &ldquo;Ringing noise for weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury giggled. "Definitely sounds like Ink. With maybe a bit more talking than normal for him; he's usually too busy being &lsquo;tall, dark, and mysterious.' "&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skulk made a rattling laugh, &ldquo;&lsquo;Nah, the first part was implied. All he actually said was &lsquo;catch me if I have a seizure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skulk gave Fury an upside down look from where she was flopped over the chair, then tilted her head, &ldquo;So do you like&hellip; <em>like </em>Ink?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury tossed her hair. "I'm <em>fond</em> of him," she said. "I think he's cute, and very smart. Probably the smartest elf I've ever met. And <em>adorable </em>when he's trying to be intimidating; seriously, he tried to intimidate Ankkh,and it was super cute." She grabbed her scroll from where it landed, and started rolling it back up. "I reserve the right to <em>like</em> like him after I've known him a little longer; I've made that mistake before."</p>
<p>Skulk made a groaning noise, then slowly pulled her hands over her face, &ldquo;Oh Goddess you <em>do</em> like him. Iiiiiiiiink, why are you <em>like this&hellip;</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury shrugged. "It just happens to some people, and there's not a lot you can do about it. Except make him less kind and sexy. And maybe stop him from surprising people when they're taking a bath."</p>
<p>Skulk started to groan again, then stopped. She pointed a finger at Fury, &ldquo;... Okay, <em>now</em> you&rsquo;re fucking with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury shook her head, smiling. "No, seriously, he popped in on me when I was taking a bath. He was <em>soo</em> embarrassed. It was really cute."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ink,</em>&rdquo; Skulk growled, &ldquo;Seriously? Creepy eight foot tall elf teleports into your bathroom and he somehow makes it seem <em>cute?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When he's blushing like he's going to explode?" Fury said. "Hells yes. He's way too much of a sweetheart to have done it on purpose, not that I particularly care. And I owe him, anyway."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Skulk raised both eyebrows, &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury bit her lip. "He&hellip; he lent me a scroll that helped me&hellip; resolve some things. From my past. Not everything, but&hellip; something that I did, that was a bit less of my fault than I thought. And a bit more. It&rsquo;s complicated."</p>
<p>Skulk frowned and folded her arms, staring at Fury, &ldquo;Yeah? Well, I can&rsquo;t pry for secrets, so&hellip; hm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused before answering, &ldquo;Look, Sparky&hellip; if you <em>do </em>like Ink, just&hellip; do me a favor and be careful okay? He&rsquo;s... &ldquo;</p>
<p>She searched for words for a moment, with a look of more genuine concern on her face, &ldquo;Ink&rsquo;s&hellip; people think he&rsquo;s weird and distant and all that, and he is, but he&rsquo;s got a&hellip; he&rsquo;s got a good soul. He&rsquo;s&hellip; a lot more fragile than he seems though. When&hellip; what we all went through, it almost broke him. I thought it <em>did</em> break him. He drew back into his shell and didn&rsquo;t let anything show. Everything that happened, I never thought I&rsquo;d see him again, but lately? Lately he&rsquo;s been coming back, in bits and pieces. He&rsquo;s this big powerful shadowmage and all that, but he&rsquo;s my little brother too, and he&rsquo;s got a heart of glass in there. I&rsquo;m starting to see it put it back together, and well&hellip; I&rsquo;m worried if he breaks again, he&rsquo;ll <em>never</em> come back together, so...&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave Fury a blank look, &ldquo;If someone fucks with my brother&rsquo;s heart I&rsquo;ll kill them in their sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury nodded. "Message received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skulk showed some teeth in what might have been a smile, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Sparky, cuz I&rsquo;m <em>just</em> starting to like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury paused. "So freaking out and setting you on fire helped?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skulk chuckled and waved a hand dismissively, &ldquo;Yeah, well, you don&rsquo;t fuck with people like I do without being able to take a little return fire. &lsquo;Sides, you showed you got some spark, Sparky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Well, if you want another demonstration, there's more where that came from." Fury smiled. "...Is there anything we have around here that you actually <em>can</em> eat? I can get the staff to bring something up. I hate to just leave you standing around; I feel like a bad host."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Last time we were in Surt, some of the street vendors had these&hellip; little spiced meats on sticks that fire elves were supposed to cook themselves. We just ate &lsquo;em raw, but they were pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury nodded. "I'm sure they can get you some." She hopped back to her feet, and stepped over to the door. "Don't disappear on me, please!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>She popped the door open and poked her head outside, then began whispering to the guard standing out in the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we could go get some,&rdquo; Skulk commented, &ldquo;Seriously, you look like you need it. When was the last time you just went and did something for kicks?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury turned back. "...I think last&hellip; month? ...No, that was the end of last season. It&hellip; it's been a bit."&nbsp;</p>
<p>She whispered something to the guard, and then closed the door and sauntered over to her armoire. "Give me a second. I need to put on something that looks a bit less like I've been sleeping in it."</p>
<p>"Sure," Skulk rolled her hand and stayed draped over the chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury tossed off her pajamas, threw on a clean chiton, and pulled her brush through her hair. "So&hellip; are there a lot of people who <em>like</em> like Ink? You kind of implied that earlier."</p>
<p>Skulk rattled a laugh, "Worried about the competition, Sparky?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe a little,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I already know Amenidal is&hellip; interested. I&rsquo;m not sure how Ink feels about any of this, but I kind of doubt he&rsquo;d appreciate &lsquo;massive love polygon wars&rsquo; about him.&rdquo; She turned back to Skulk. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Skulk rolled herself to standing, &ldquo;And <em>ugh,</em> Twinkles the Doe Eyed is worse than <em>you.</em> Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure how he feels about any of this either, cuz he <em>says</em> he doesn&rsquo;t care about that kind of thing, but then he&hellip;&rdquo; she made a few hand gestures, &ldquo;<em>does stuff,</em> ugh, man, I really hope I don&rsquo;t have to murder either of you. C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I kind of thought you were going to murder me a year ago,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo; &lsquo;Putting it off until I screw up&rsquo; is definitely an improvement.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Skulk laughed the most real sounding laugh Fury had ever heard come out of her, "Aw, Sparky, that was just puttin' on a show. If I actually wanted to kill you, you'd never know."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury smiled. &ldquo;Better than being killed and fully aware of it. Just make sure you kill me in a contained space or underwater or something. I already detonate when I&rsquo;m surprised to trying to sleep &mdash; I have no idea what&rsquo;ll happen when I die.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You got it Sparky, thanks for the heads up," Skulk threw a gangly arm over Fury's shoulder, "Now c'mon, let's get some grub."&nbsp;</p>
