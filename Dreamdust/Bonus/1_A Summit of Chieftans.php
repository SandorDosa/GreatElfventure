<p>A few months have passed since Pebble’s chance encounter with Tik’Tak. The winter was colder than the Dreamdust elves
    were used to, but milder than the freezing winters of the central continent. It seems that the cold weather suited
    the cold relationship between the two tribes. For those winter months, there was little contact between the Machakw
    and the Dreamdust elves. Scouts and pathfinders report seeing Machakw scouts watching them from a distance, but
    neither group ever approached the other. No violence, but also no communication.</p>
