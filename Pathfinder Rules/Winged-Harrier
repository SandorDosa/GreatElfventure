        Winged Elf Pathfinder Racial Archetype - Harrier
    </title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Harrier</h1>
<p><i>The harrier is an archetype of the fighter class, available to winged elf fighters.</i></p>

<p>Winged elves are unmatched in their element, making deadly use of their flight. Using swift strikes from above, they plummet onto their foes with lethal force.</p>

<p><b>Class Features</b><br />
A harrier has the following class features:</p>

<p><b>Class Skills</b><br />
A harrier adds Fly to their list of class skills and removes Swim.</p>

<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b><br />
A harrier is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields, and cannot fly while carrying them. They are proficient with ranged weapons, including select exotic weapons. Bows, nets, javelins, atlatls/amentums, and bolas are common favorites.</p>

<p><b>Combat Flyer </b><br />
At 2nd level, a harrier gains the racial feat Dive Attack. They may also use their fighter bonus feats to select Flyby Attack or Hover. </p>

<p>This ability replaces bravery.</p>

<p><b>Aerial Adept</b><br />
At 5th level, a harrier’s Fly speed increases by 10ft, and they may make a Fly check instead of an Acrobatics check to move through a threatened area or an enemy’s space. </p>

<p>This ability replaces the 4th level bonus feat</p>

<p><b>Flying Dodger</b><br />
At 9th level, when a harrier flies at least half their fly speed on their turn, they gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +4 at 17th level.</p>

<p>This ability replaces Bravery 2</p>

<p><b>Plummeting Charge</b><br />
At 13th level, if a harrier flies at least half their fly speed as part of a charge, they gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll (in addition to the normal charge bonus) and a +4 bonus on a critical confirmation roll. These bonuses improve to +4 and +6 at 17th level.</p>

<p>This ability replaces Bravery 3 and 4 </p>
